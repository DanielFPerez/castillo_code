The story begins on Trantor, the capital of the 12,000-year-old Galactic Empire, powerful but slowly decaying. Hari Seldon, a mathematician and psychologist, has developed psychohistory, a new field of science and psychology that treats all possibilities in large societies by mathematics, allowing for the probabilistic prediction of future events.\n\nBy means of psychohistory, Seldon has discovered the decline and eventual fall of the Empire, angering the aristocratic members of the Commission of Public Safety, the de facto rulers of the Empire. The Commission considers Seldon's views and statements treasonous, and he is arrested along with the young mathematician Gaal Dornick, who has arrived on Trantor to join Seldon's group. Seldon is tried by the Commission; he defends his beliefs, explaining his theories and predictions, including his belief that the Empire will collapse in 300 years and while a Second Empire will eventually rise it will only come after a 30,000-year dark age. He informs the Commission that an alternative to this future is attainable and explains to them that creating a compendium of all human knowledge, the Encyclopedia Galactica, may not prevent the inevitable fall of the Empire but would reduce the dark age to one millennium.\n\nThe skeptical Commission, not wanting to make Seldon a martyr, offers him exile to a remote world, Terminus, with others who could help him create the Encyclopedia. He accepts their offer, prepares for the departure of the \"Encyclopedists\" and receives an imperial decree officially acknowledging his actions. Seldon informs Dornick that, despite the Empire's belief it won by exiling Seldon, the outcome was exactly what he had intended and hoped for. Terminus would be the home of the first Foundation while a second would be established \"at Star's End.\" Seldon then reveals that he is dying, and implores Dornick to become a leader in the new Foundation.", "longest_response": "Here are the full names of the characters listed in the text:\n\nHari Seldon\nGaal Dornick\n(since no full given name is provided for Gaal Dornick, he is listed with his surname only)", "shortest_response": "- Hari Seldon\n- Gaal Dornick", "input_size": 468, "output_sizes": [12, 25, 23, 20, 12, 21, 20, 23, 47, 22], "output_mean": 22.5, "output_std": 9.18, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 20.0, "p50": 21.5, "p75": 23.0, "p99": 45.02}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "information_extraction", "gen_time": 1.41579}, {"sample_id": "c5768d8dfa1a78ea", "prompt_id": "0476e9652a3c58f9", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What was the The Treaty of Tordesillas?\nContext: In 1383, John I of Castile, husband of Beatrice of Portugal and son-in-law of Ferdinand I of Portugal, claimed the throne of Portugal. A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by John of Aviz (later King John I of Portugal) and commanded by General Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira defeated the Castilians in the Battle of Aljubarrota. With this battle, the House of Aviz became the ruling house of Portugal.\n\nThe new ruling dynasty would proceed to push Portugal to the limelight of European politics and culture, creating and sponsoring works of literature, like the Cr\u00f3nicas d'el Rei D. Jo\u00e3o I by Fern\u00e3o Lopes, the first riding and hunting manual Livro da ensinan\u00e7a de bem cavalgar toda sela and O Leal Conselheiro both by King Edward of Portugal and the Portuguese translations of Cicero's De Oficiis and Seneca's De Beneficiis by the well traveled Prince Peter of Coimbra, as well as his magnum opus Tratado da Vertuosa Benfeytoria. In an effort of solidification and centralization of royal power the monarchs of this dynasty also ordered the compilation, organization and publication of the first three compilations of laws in Portugal: the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es d'el Rei D. Duarte, which was never enforced; the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Afonsinas, whose application and enforcement was not uniform across the realm; and the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Manuelinas, which took advantage of the printing press to reach every corner of the kingdom. The Avis Dynasty also sponsored works of architecture like the Mosteiro da Batalha (literally, the Monastery of the Battle) and led to the creation of the manueline style of architecture in the 16th century.\n\nPortugal also spearheaded European exploration of the world and the Age of Discovery. Prince Henry the Navigator, son of King John I of Portugal, became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour. During this period, Portugal explored the Atlantic Ocean, discovering the Atlantic archipelagos the Azores, Madeira, and Cape Verde; explored the African coast; colonized selected areas of Africa; discovered an eastern route to India via the Cape of Good Hope; discovered Brazil, explored the Indian Ocean, established trading routes throughout most of southern Asia; and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to China and Japan.\n\nIn 1415, Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering Ceuta, the first prosperous Islamic trade centre in North Africa. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: Madeira and the Azores, which led to the first colonization movements.\n\nIn 1422, by decree of King John I, Portugal officially abandoned the previous dating system, the Era of Caesar, and adopted the Anno Domini system, therefore becoming the last catholic realm to do so.\n\n\nThroughout the 15th century, Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for several common types of tradable commodities at the time, ranging from gold to slaves, as they looked for a route to India and its spices, which were coveted in Europe.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas, intended to resolve the dispute that had been created following the return of Christopher Columbus, was made by Pope Alexander VI, the mediator between Portugal and Spain. It was signed on 7 June 1494, and divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two countries along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa).\n\n\nIn 1498, Vasco da Gama accomplished what Columbus set out to do and became the first European to reach India by sea, bringing economic prosperity to Portugal and its population of 1.7 million residents, and helping to start the Portuguese Renaissance. In 1500, the Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real reached what is now Canada and founded the town of Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, Newfoundland and Labrador, long before the French and English in the 17th century, and being just one of many Portuguese colonizations of the Americas.\n\nIn 1500, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral discovered Brazil and claimed it for Portugal. Ten years later, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Goa in India, Muscat and Ormuz in the Persian Strait, and Malacca, now a state in Malaysia. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic. Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe, landing in such places as Taiwan, Japan, the island of Timor, and in the Moluccas.\n\nAlthough for a long period it was believed the Dutch were the first Europeans to arrive in Australia, there is also some evidence that the Portuguese may have discovered Australia in 1521. From 1519 to 1522, Ferdinand Magellan (Fern\u00e3o de Magalh\u00e3es) organized a Spanish expedition to the East Indies which resulted in the first circumnavigation of the globe. Magellan never made it back to Europe as he was killed by natives in the Philippines in 1521.\n\nThe Treaty of Zaragoza, signed on 22 April 1529 between Portugal and Spain, specified the anti-meridian to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas.\n\nAll these factors made Portugal one of the world's major economic, military, and political powers from the 15th century until the late 16th century.", "longest_response": "The Treaty of Tordesillas was a significant agreement between Spain and Portugal that divided the world outside Europe into two spheres of influence. This was done to resolve the dispute that arose after Christopher Columbus' voyages and the subsequent claims by both countries over newly discovered lands. Here\u2019s a more detailed breakdown of the treaty\u2019s context and its implications:\n\n### Context\n\n1. **Columbus' Voyages and Dispute**:\n   - **Christopher Columbus** returned to Europe with reports of newly discovered lands. His voyages led to the initial assumption that these lands were part of Asia, specifically the East Indies, as was commonly believed at the time.\n   - **Portuguese Claims**: Portugal, through its maritime explorations under Prince Henry the Navigator, had also discovered and claimed large parts of the West African coast and the Atlantic islands.\n   - **Spanish Claims**: Similarly, Spain had its own claims over parts of the New World, especially after Columbus' return.\n\n2. **Popes Mediation**:\n   - Since Rome was the center of the Christian world, the Papacy sought to resolve the disputes between the two kingdoms to avoid potential conflict.\n\n### The Treaty of Tordesillas\n\n**Signed**: June 7, 1494\n\n**Parties Involved**: Spain under King Ferdinand II and Portugal under King John II\n\n- **Purpose**: To avoid conflict between Spain and Portugal regarding their respective claims over newly discovered lands.\n- **Division**: The treaty divided the non-Christian world into two spheres of influence:\n  - **Spain\u2019s Sphere**: Lands west of a meridian that passes through the Cape Verde Islands, 370 leagues, or roughly 1,040 leagues (approximately 3,500 kilometers), west of the prime meridian.\n  - **Portugal\u2019s Sphere**: All territories east of this meridian.\n\n### Consequences\n\n1. **Expansion of Portuguese Influence**: The treaty significantly favored Portugal, giving it the rights to newly discovered lands east of its stipulated line. This enabled Portugal to extend its influence across Africa, the Indian Ocean, and Asia.\n\n2. **Conflict in the \u201cSpanish Sphere\u201d**:\n   - While the treaty initially seemed fair, it did not entirely resolve conflicts. Spain expanded into the Americas, ignoring parts of Portugal\u2019s claimed line in territories like Venezuela, Florida, and Brazil.\n   - The treaty also failed to address the claims of native populations and their legal standing under the Catholic Church, which could lead to more disputes.\n\n3. **Further Divisions**:\n   - **Treaty of Zaragoza (1529)**: Due to further disputes between Spain and Portugal over islands in the East Indies, another treaty was signed. This treaty adjusted the meridian and introduced an anti-meridian to the line of demarcation, further specifying areas of influence.\n\n### Legacy\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas significantly transformed the diplomatic and political landscape:\n\n- **Age of Discovery**: It provided a framework for the European powers' expansion across the globe, laying the groundwork for global trade, colonization, and cultural exchange.\n- **Economic Implications**: The division led to distinct colonial possessions, significantly impacting the economic development of Portugal, Spain, and other European countries.\n- **Catherine the Great\u2019s Law**: In 1720, Russia enacted a law recognizing the Treaty of Tordesillas, ceding its Far East lands to China, but also granting Russia trading rights from Kamchatka to Kolyma. This helped Russia avoid conflict while maintaining trade relations.\n\nIn summary, the Treaty of Tordesillas was a pivotal moment that established the rules of engagement between European powers as they began to explore and colonize the rest of the world. However, its effectiveness was limited by the ongoing disputes and the evolving geopolitical realities of the time.", "shortest_response": "The Treaty of Tordesillas was a significant agreement signed on June 7, 1494, between Spain and Portugal. The treaty, initiated by Pope Alexander VI, aimed to resolve the territorial disputes that arose after Christopher Columbus's voyage. Spain and Portugal had previously established the Line of Demarcation at the Canary Islands, but this did not resolve the issue decisively.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas specified that:\n\n- Any newly discovered lands east of the Line of Demarcation (which passes through the Cape Verde islands and is 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands) would belong to Portugal.\n- Any newly discovered lands west of the Line of Demarcation would belong to Spain.\n\nThis division was meant to end the disputes over colonial claims and allow both countries to explore and colonize the new lands without conflict. However, the treaty also had an unintended consequence of encouraging both nations to venture beyond the designated lines, leading to further conflicts.\n\nDespite the treaty's intentions to avoid disputes, it did not prevent later conflicts, most notably the controversy over the ownership of certain lands, especially in the Americas. The treaty highlighted the growing competition and expansionist tendencies among European powers during the Age of Discovery.\n\nIn context, the Treaty of Tordesillas was a result of Portugal's growing maritime prowess and exploratory ventures under the Avis Dynasty, and Spain's territorial claim disputes following Columbus's discoveries.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you:\n\n### 1. Understand OKRs\nBefore you start, make sure you comprehend the basics of OKRs:\n- **Objectives**: These are qualitative goals you want to achieve. They should be ambitious yet challenging.\n- **Key Results**: These are quantitative, measurable outcomes that will indicate whether an Objective is met or not.\n\n### 2. Set the Context\n- **Review Past OKRs**: Reflect on the successes and failures of the previous OKRs to understand what worked and what didn\u2019t.\n- **Align with Organization Goals**: Ensure your team\u2019s OKRs are aligned with the broader organizational objectives.\n\n### 3. Gather Input\n- **Team Brainstorming**:Hold a collaborative session with your team to gather ideas and insights about what is important to focus on.\n- **Stakeholder Input**: Listen to input from other stakeholders both within and outside the team to ensure a comprehensive understanding of priority areas.\n\n### 4. Set Clear Objectives\n- **Focus on Ambitious but Achievable Goals**: Objectives should be challenging but realistic. A common practice is to set OKRs that will stretch your team but are still achievable with significant effort.\n- **Limit the Number of Objectives**: Typically, 3-5 objectives per team is recommended for clarity and focus.\n- **Use Specific Language**: Use clear and definitive language, avoiding vague or ambiguous terms.\n\n### 5. Define Key Results\nFor each Objective, define 3-5 measurable Key Results. These should be:\n- **Quantitative**: They should have a clear number associated with them.\n- **Measurable**: They should be easy to track and assess.\n- **Time-Bound**: They should have a definite deadline.\n\n### 6. Set OKR Time Frame\n- **Typical Duration**: OKRs are usually set on a quarterly or annual basis, but this can be adjusted based on your organizational needs and team dynamics.\n\n### 7. Communicate OKRs\n- **Make It Clear**: Clearly communicate the OKRs throughout the team and ensure everyone understands their role in achieving the objectives.\n- **Ensure Alignment**: Make sure that individual OKRs are aligned with the team\u2019s OKRs.\n\n### 8. Track Progress and Adjust\n- **Regular Check-Ins**: Hold regular check-ins to discuss progress and any challenges.\n- **Adjust as Needed**: Be prepared to adjust OKRs mid-cycle if significant conditions change.\n\n### 9. Review and Evaluate\n- **End of Quarter Review**: At the end of the OKR cycle, review the outcomes.\n- **Feedback Loop**: Use this review to gather feedback, reflect on successes and failures, and inform the next set of OKRs.\n\n### 10. Celebrate Success and Learn\n- **Recognize Achievements**: Acknowledge and celebrate when OKRs are met or exceeded.\n- **Learn from Failures**: If objectives aren\u2019t achieved, analyze why and what can be learned from it to improve future OKRs.\n\n### Example OKRs\n**Objective**: Improve Customer Satisfaction\n- **Key Results**:\n  - Increase Net Promoter Score (NPS) by 20 points.\n  - Reduce Average Resolution Time (ART) by 15%.\n  - Increase positive customer reviews by 50 feedbacks on social media.\n  - Decrease the number of support tickets from customers by 10% through proactive measures.\n\nBy following this process, you can develop OKRs that are clear, measurable, and achievable, helping your team stay focused and aligned towards important goals.", "shortest_response": "To develop effective Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for your team, follow this step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Understand OKRs:**\n   - Objectives are ambitious, time-bound goals that drive you and your team forward.\n   - Key Results are measurable outcomes that demonstrate you've achieved your objectives.\n\n2. **Align OKRs with the Company:**\n   - Ensure your team's OKRs align with the company's mission, vision, and annual OKRs.\n   - This ensures everyone is working towards the same goals, fostering alignment and collaboration.\n\n3. **Set Personal OKRs:**\n   - Identify what you want to achieve personally in your role.\n   - Make sure your personal OKRs contribute to the team's and company's OKRs.\n\n4. **Engage Your Team:**\n   - Involve your team in the OKR setting process.\n   - Foster a collaborative environment where everyone's ideas and insights are valued.\n\n5. **Follow a Time-bound Approach:**\n   - OKRs are typically set quarterly, but there's no one-size-fits-all time frame.

Here\u2019s a deeper examination of her significance:\n\n### Context of Construction and Acquisition\n- **Origin**: Originally intended to be built for the Khedivate of Egypt (an autonomous vassal state of the Ottoman Empire) in the 1860s, the Turkish government eventually compelled Khedival Egypt to transfer the ship to the Ottoman Navy.\n- **Shipyard**: Constructed at the French Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde shipyard, Hifz-ur Rahman was initially designed as a modern, heavily armed steamship for the Egyptian navy.\n\n### Armament and Design\n- **Weapons**: Hifz-ur Rahman was equipped with advanced artillery for its time. She was armed with:\n  - Two 229 mm (9 inch) Armstrong guns in revolving turrets.\n  - Two 178 mm (7 inch) Armstrong guns in revolving turrets.\n  - These turrets provided a significant advantage in terms of mobility and firepower.\n- **Turreted Design**: The use of revolving turrets, a revolutionary design at the time, enabled the ship to engage targets from multiple directions without needing to alter its position.\n\n### Operational History\n1. **Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878)**\n   - **Danube Operations**: In this conflict, Hifz-ur Rahman was employed in the defense of Turkish territories, in particular protecting the strategic port of Sulina on the Danube River. Here, she engaged with Russian gunboats in inconclusive actions.\n   - Her involvement showcased the ship's capability but also highlighted the broader struggles of the Ottoman fleet against the more technologically advanced Russian navy.\n\n2. **Layout Up and Rebuilding**\n   - **Inactive Period (1878-1897)**: After the war, Hifz-ur Rahman was decommissioned and laid up due to the poor condition of the Ottoman fleet. This period offered a chance for thorough assessment and potential future plans.\n   - **Greco-Turkish War Initiation (1897)**: The war against Greece led to an urgent need for modernization to counterbalance the emerging Greek navy with its modern vessels like the Georgios I.\n\n3. **Rebuilding Attempt**\n   - **Ottoman Reconstruction Efforts (1890s)**: During the early 1890s, there was a concerted effort to modernize the navy, including Hifz-ur Rahman. However, her significant service time and lack of maintenance likely posed significant technical challenges during the refurbishment process.\n\n### Outcome and Legacy\n- **Fate**: Despite the rebuilding attempts, Hifz-ur Rahman did not see any further significant operational deployment. She was eventually decommissioned and sold for scrap in 1909, reflecting the declining naval capabilities of the Ottoman Empire and the need to replace aging and non-viable vessels.\n\n### Historical Significance\n- **Technological Reflection**: Hifz-ur Rahman\u2019s construction and employment signify the transition from wooden ships to ironclads in the Ottoman Navy, representing significant advancements in naval technology.\n- **Political and Operational Challenges**: Her career highlights the complex political landscape of the 19th-century Ottoman Empire and the operational difficulties of maintaining a modern navy during periods of regional conflict and internal turmoil.\n\nIn summary, Hifz-ur Rahman stands as a testament to the strategic and technological aspirations of the late Ottoman Navy, albeit marred by the challenges of political instability and evolving naval standards of the time.", "shortest_response": "Hifz-ur Rahman was an important ship in the Ottoman Navy, particularly during the late 19th century.

It generally uses the iconic mascarpone cream infused with hot chocolate or espresso chocolate, providing a cocoa-infused twist compared to the traditional recipe.\n- **Textures:** Chocolate tiramisu often includes layers of chocolate and cream, possibly also incorporating chocolate wafers or crumbled chocolate cookies. This version can have a smooth, creamy center, with a slightly bitter contrast from the chocolate.\n- **Presentation:** It might look more luxurious or decadent, with its chocolate-infused layers often providing an eye-catching, almost elegant aesthetic.\n\n### Tiramisu with Strawberries\n- **Flavor:** Strawberry tiramisu offers a lighter, fruity, and slightly sweet counterpoint to the traditional recipe. The cream layers contain fresh strawberry puree or sliced strawberries, and the whole dish carries a fruity aroma.\n- **Textures:** This variant is typically more vibrant in terms of texture with the addition of fresh berries. The cream is mixed with strawberry puree, which adds a refreshing, juicy element to the dessert.\n- **Presentation:** Strawberry tiramisu often evokes thoughts of summer and freshness, with its bright colors and natural components. It is visually appealing for those who enjoy fresh, fruity desserts.\n\n### Which is Better?\n- **Taste Preference:** If you enjoy the classic intense flavors of coffee and mascarpone, traditional tiramisu with coffee-soaked ladyfingers might be your preference. If you prefer a lighter, sweeter, more fruity dessert, the strawberry version may be more appealing.\n- **Seasonal Appetite:** Strawberry tiramisu is perfect for those who wish to enjoy fresh summer fruits in a decadent dessert. However, for a rich, more luxurious treat, especially during winter or colder months, the chocolate tiramisu may be more desirable.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth variations can be excellent choices depending on your taste preference and mood.

Here\u2019s a general guide for optimal flex slot usage:\n\n### Standard Scoring System:\n- **Running Back (RB)**\n  - RBs typically have high value in standard scoring as they can score a lot of points with carries and receptions.\n- **Wide Receiver (WR)**\n  - WRs can also be very valuable, especially those with strong passing yards, receptions, and receiving yards.\n\n### PPR (Points Per Reception) Scoring Systems:\n- **Wide Receiver (WR)**\n  - In PPR leagues, WRs are often the best choices for the flex position because they usually have the most volume in both passing yards and receptions.\n- **Running Back (RB)**\n  - RBs can also be strong in PPR leagues, particularly those who get a fair number of receptions and yards.\n\n### Half-PPR Scoring Systems:\n- **Wide Receiver (WR)**\n  - Similar to full PPR, WRs are generally a good choice.\n- **Running Back (RB)**\n  - RBs with strong rushing capabilities can also be valuable, especially if they contribute in various scoring categories.\n\n### Flex Slot Tips:\n1. **Position by Weakness**: If your lineup lacks a strong WR, consider using your RB in the flex position. Conversely, if you need to boost your TE or WR production, use an RB if your TE or WR are weak or not as valuable.\n2. **Matchups**: Always consider the matchups when deciding on your flex position. For example, if you know an opposing defense is weak against running backs, you might consider using an RB in the flex.\n3. **Depth**: Ensure you're also aware of your team's depth at each position. If you have a solid bench WR but a lesser-known RB, putting the WR in the flex could be a better choice.\n4. **Scoring Potential**: Consider the scoring potential of each player. If you have a player who could potentially have a big game, use them in the flex.\n\n### Example Scenarios:\n- **If you have elite QBs, focus on WRs in the flex position**: Because QB scoring is often less variable than WR or RB, it makes sense to maximize your flex spot with high-producing receivers.\n- **When your league is heavy on RBs, consider taking the WR**: If you have a roster filled with RBs, switching a WR into the flex can provide additional scoring opportunities.\n- **In standard leagues, consider high-volume plays**: Players with a high number of touches (carries, receptions) are more likely to score points, irrespective of their position.\n\nUltimately, the best position to use in your flex slot depends on the specific context of your league, your roster, and your opponent\u2019s lineups.

Here's a general guideline on the positions that are typically considered best for a flex slot:\n\n1. **Flex Slot Best Position**:\n   - **Running Back (RB)**: RB positions often come with great running ability and receiving skills, making them highly valuable in the flex role. They can score 10-14 points a week just through rushing yards.\n   - **Wide Receiver (WR)**: A good WR can provide both rushing and receiving yards, making them another excellent choice for the flex position.\n\nOther considerations:\n- **Quarterback (QB) / Tight End (TE)**: In some leagues or scoring settings, a starting QB or a top-tier TE might be a good option in the flex slot. However, these positions usually come with higher risks due to weekly matchups and potential bye weeks.\n\nTo optimize your flex strategy, consider:\n- **Matchups**: Facing weak defenses can favor specific positions over others.\n- **Player Scoring Structure**: Ensure that your league's scoring system (points per yard, touchdown bonus, etc.) corresponds to the strengths of your chosen position.\n- **Bye Weeks**: Monitor bye weeks for your players to balance the load in your lineup.\n- **Depth and Bench**: Use your knowledge of depth and bench players to get the most out of your flex position.\n\nIn summary, running backs and wide receivers are generally the most versatile and highest-performing options for your flex slot.

Although it's not feasible to create a fully flying aircraft from duct tape for practical reasons, we can certainly build a small, simplified model that resembles a basic airplane design. For safety reasons, this model should not be flown. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Materials Needed:\n1. **Duct Tape:** In various colors (e.g., black, silver, white)\n2. **Wooden Stick or Wire Frame:** To form the basic structure of the wings and fuselage. You can buy these from a craft store or hobby supply store.\n3. **Scissors or X-Acto Knife:** To cut the duct tape.\n4. **Sandpaper (optional):** To smooth the surfaces.\n5. **Aluminum Foil or Lightweight Foam:** (To reinforce the interior and give structure)\n6. **String or Dental Floss:** For connecting the parts together\n7. **Paint and Paintbrush or Spray Paint:** (Optional, for decoration)\n8. **Clear Coat or Varnish:** To seal and protect the duct tape\n\n### Steps to Build the Duct Tape Plane:\n\n#### 1. Create the Fuselage:\n   - **Frame the Fuselage:** Using the wooden stick or wire, create a basic fuselage frame, shaping it into a tube-like structure.\n   - **Wrap with Duct Tape:** Start wrapping duct tape around the frame at least three or four layers thick for strength. Make sure to seal the edges well.\n   - **Add Decorative Tape:** You can use additional color schemes to add design to your plane, such as strips of different colors along the length of the fuselage.\n\n#### 2. Create the Wings:\n   - **Frame the Wings:** Use the sticks or wire to form the framework for the wings. The wings should be slightly swept back for a more realistic design.\n   - **Connect the Wings:**Attach the wings to the fuselage with string or floss to maintain their stability.\n   - **Wrap the Wings:** Cover the wing frames with duct tape in at least two to three layers for stability.\n\n#### 3. Add the Tail:\n   - **Create the Tail Assembly:** Use another stick or wire to create the horizontal and vertical tail pieces.\n   - **Connect to Fuselage:** Attach the tail pieces to the fuselage using string or floss.\n   - **Cover with Duct Tape:** Wrap the tail pieces with duct tape to blend them with the rest of the plane. Ensure they are secure and stable.\n\n#### 4. Reinforcement (Optional but Recommended):\n   - **Interior Reinforcement:** Cut out shapes of aluminum foil or lightweight foam and insert them inside the fuselage and wing structures to add stability. Wrap this reinforcement with additional layers of duct tape.\n   - **Sealing and Smoothing:** Use sandpaper to smooth the outer surfaces if necessary. This will also allow the clear coat to adhere better.\n\n#### 5. Painting and Finishing Touches:\n   - **Paint the Plane:** Apply a base coat in the color you wish. Then, you can add designs or stripes using contrasting colors.\n   - **Seal with Clear Coat:** Apply a clear coat or varnish to protect the duct tape from wear and tear. Allow it to dry completely.\n\n#### 6. Test the Model:\n   - **Static Display:** The duct tape plane is mostly decorative.

Here are some reasons why dogs might be considered better for a person's physical well-being compared to cats:\n\n1. **Exercise**: Dogs require regular exercise, which means they help encourage their owners to be more active. Walking, playing fetch, or going for jogs with a dog are all examples of activities that can improve cardiovascular health, strength, and flexibility. On the other hand, cats are generally more content to laze around, so their owners may not engage in as much physical activity.\n\n2. **Social Interaction**: Dogs are social animals that thrive on interaction with their human families. Their enthusiasm for play and companionship often translates into increased social interaction for their owners. This can help combat feelings of loneliness and depression, which are linked to various physical health issues. While cats can also provide companionship, their independent nature means they may not always seek out social interaction in the same way as dogs.\n\n3. **Stress Relief**: Playing with or caring for a dog has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety levels by increasing the production of endorphins in the brain. This stress relief can have a positive impact on overall physical health. Some studies suggest that dog owners have lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol, and overall lower mortality rates compared to non-dog owners.\n\n4. **Structure and Routine**: Dogs require consistent feeding, exercise, and other forms of care. This daily routine can offer a sense of structure and stability that can be beneficial for mental and physical health. It can help manage stress, promote better sleep patterns, and overall contribute to a healthier lifestyle.\n\n5. **Family Bonding**: Dogs often become an integral part of the family, bringing everyone together through shared experiences. This family bonding can enhance mental and emotional well-being, which can have indirect benefits on physical health. While cats can also be a source of joy and companionship, their more independent nature may limit the same level of family integration.\n\n6. **Seniors and Health Monitoring**: Dogs are particularly useful for seniors, as they can act as early warning systems for health issues. For instance, they can alert their owners to changes in health status, such as altered sense of smell or hearing, or to medical emergencies. Additionally, the need to care for a dog can provide motivation for older adults to stay active longer.\n\nWhile cats also have their unique benefits, such as gentle companionship and emotional support, these specific factors often make dogs advantageous when it comes to overall physical health. However, the best pet depends largely on individual preferences and lifestyle.", "shortest_response": "Dogs and cats can both bring significant benefits to a person's physical health, but there are a few specific ways in which owning a dog might be particularly beneficial. Here are a few reasons:\n\n1. **Encourages Physical Activity**: Dogs, especially breeds known for their energy levels, require regular exercise. This can motivate their owners to go for walks or run with their pets, which is beneficial for cardiovascular health and overall fitness.\n\n2. **Promotes a Healthier Lifestyle**: Owning a dog has been linked to a healthier lifestyle. Dog owners tend to engage in more physical activity and are less likely to be overweight or obese.\n\n3. **Reduces Blood Pressure**: Regular interaction with dogs can help reduce blood pressure, heart rate, and the production of cortisol (a stress hormone).\n\n4. **Boosts Mental Health and Reduces Loneliness**: Owning a dog can provide a sense of purpose and companionship, which can help combat loneliness and improve mental health. This, in turn, can have a positive impact on physical health as stress and loneliness can affect various aspects of a person's health.\n\n5. **Improves Immune System**: Studies have shown that children growing up with dogs may have reduced risk of allergies and asthma, and the presence of a dog in the home can enhance immune function in adults as well.\n\n6. **Encourages Socialization**: Dog walks and interactions at dog parks can help owners meet new people and build their social network, which is another aspect of overall well-being.\n\nWhile cats can also provide physical and mental health benefits, including companionship, stress reduction, and a sense of purpose, dogs may offer additional benefits due to their tendency to promote more physical activity and interaction with others.", "input_size": 16, "output_sizes": [394, 394, 377, 539, 396, 416, 414, 461, 356, 353], "output_mean": 410.0, "output_std": 52.21, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 381.25, "p50": 395.0, "p75": 415.5, "p99": 531.98}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "open_qa", "gen_time": 13.05271}, {"sample_id": "ecfb3376d88da8cc", "prompt_id": "ba3085fa0204bb72", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What are Singapore's official languages?\nContext: Singapore (/\u02c8s\u026a\u014b(\u0261)\u0259p\u0254\u02d0r/ (listen)), officially the Republic of Singapore, is an island country and city-state in maritime Southeast Asia.

The earliest known Easter egg in software in general is one placed in the \"make\" command for PDP-6/PDP-10 computers sometime in October 1967\u2013October 1968, wherein if the user attempts to create a file named \"love\" by typing \"make love\", the program responds \"not war?\" before proceeding.", "longest_response": "The concept of Easter eggs in video games finds its origin in the idea of hidden messages or features within software. While the term \"Easter egg\" itself was coined around 1979 by Steve Wright, who was the then-Director of Software Development in the Atari Consumer Division, the practice of hiding such features actually dates back to earlier times, including in video games.\n\n### Early Instances of Easter Eggs in Software\n- **PDP-6/PDP-10 Easter Egg (1967-1968):** The earliest known Easter egg is in the \"make\" command for PDP-6/PDP-10 computers. If a user attempts to create a file named \"love\" by typing \"make love\", the program responds with \"not war?\" before proceeding. This early Easter egg is a playful example of injecting a hidden message into command-line software.\n\n### In Video Games\n- **Moonlander (1973):** The earliest known video game Easter egg is found in this game. In Moonlander, players control a Lunar module attempting to land on the moon. If the player opts to fly the module horizontally through several of the game's screens, they encounter a McDonald's restaurant. If they land next to it, the astronaut will visit the restaurant instead of standing next to the ship. This simple yet clever trick is often considered one of the first examples of an Easter egg in video games.\n\n### Popularization and Modern Usage\n- **Adventure (1976-1977):** Atari's Adventure was one of the first games to popularize the concept of Easter eggs in video games. The term was officially coined by Steve Wright in this context, referring to hidden messages or features within the game. Wright placed various messages and visual references to \"Star Wars\" and other pop culture icons within the game, adding to its charm and engagement.\n- **The Legend of Zelda (1986):** This iconic game in the Zelda franchise introduced numerous Easter eggs and secret items hidden throughout the game. The spirit of the hidden Easter egg became a signature part of the Zelda series, contributing to its enduring appeal.\n- **Modern Video Games:** Easter eggs have become ubiquitous in modern video games, with developers frequently including hidden jokes, references, and mini-games. They enhance replayability and serve as nods to fans of the franchises or subtle tributes to other developers and works.\n\n### Impact\nEaster eggs in video games serve multiple purposes:\n1. **Engagement and Challenges:** They add an extra layer of fun by providing players with additional challenges or hidden rewards.\n2. **Nostalgia and Pop Culture References:** They often connect with pop culture references and nostalgia, creating a sense of camaraderie among players.\n3. **Developer's Signature:** They act as distinctive signatures of developers, reflecting their creativity and personality.\n4. **Marketing:** Easter eggs can also be used as a form of marketing to generate buzz and excitement about the game.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Easter egg in video games is a longstanding tradition that began with playful hidden messages in early software and video games like Moonlander.

Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995, Vapnik et al., 1997[citation needed]) SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods, being based on statistical learning frameworks or VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974). Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n\nIn addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\nThe support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data.[citation needed] These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data to groups and, then, to map new data according to these clusters.", "longest_response": "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful and widely used supervised learning models in the field of machine learning, especially for classification tasks. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the key concepts and how SVMs work:\n\n### Core Concepts of SVM\n\n1. **Data Mapping and Hyperplane**:\n   - SVMs aim to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data into two different classes. The hyperplane is defined by a decision boundary that maximizes the margin between the two classes.\n   - The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class, known as support vectors.\n\n2. **Support Vectors**:\n   - Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the hyperplane. They are the critical elements in defining the position and orientation of the hyperplane.\n   - Only the support vectors are used to define the optimal hyperplane, making SVMs efficient in terms of memory usage.\n\n3. **Kernel Trick**:\n   - SVMs can handle non-linear classification through the use of kernel functions. These kernels implicitly map the input features into high-dimensional spaces, where they can find a hyperplane that separates the classes.\n   - Commonly used kernels include:\n     - Linear Kernel: \\( K(x, x') = x^T x' \\)\n     - Polynomial Kernel: \\( K(x, x') = (\\gamma x^T x' + r)^d \\)\n     - Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel (Gaussian Kernel): \\( K(x, x') = \\exp(-\\gamma \\|x - x'\\|^2) \\)\n     - Sigmoid Kernel: \\( K(x, x') = \\tanh(\\gamma x^T x' + r) \\)\n\n4. **Hinge Loss**:\n   - SVMs utilize a hinge loss function to handle misclassifications. If an example lies within the margin, the hinge loss is zero. For misclassified points (outside the margin), the hinge loss is positive and influences the optimization process to maximize the margin.\n   - The hinge loss function is given by:\n     \\[\n     L(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{2} \\|\\omega\\|^2 + \\xi (1 - y \\cdot \\phi(x) + \\epsilon) \\quad \\text{(for margin errors less than or equal to epsilon)}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Training**:\n   - The training process involves solving a convex optimization problem where the objective is to minimize the hinge loss subject to certain constraints. This can be formulated as an Lagrange optimization problem, which is then solved using algorithms like Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO).\n\n### Types of SVM Algorithms\n\n- **Hard Margin SVM**: Assumes that misclassifications do not occur and aims to find a hyperplane that maximally separates the two classes.\n- **Soft Margin SVM**: Introduces a regularization parameter \\( C \\) to handle misclassifications. It allows some misclassifications to occur and finds a balance between the margin width and the number of misclassified points.\n\n### Applications of SVMs\n\n- **Classification**: SVMs are widely used for binary and multi-class classification problems.\n- **Regression**: Support Vector Regression (SVR) is an extension of SVMs for regression tasks.\n- **Anomaly Detection**: SVMs can be used to detect unusual patterns in data.\n- **Dimensionality Reduction**: When used with the right kernel, SVMs can help in reducing the dimensionality of the data.\n\n### Advantages of SVM\n\n- **Effective in High-Dimensional Spaces**: SVMs perform well in spaces where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n- **Memory Efficiency**: SVMs use a subset of training points (support vectors) in the decision function, making it efficient.\n- **Versatility**: The kernel trick allows SVMs to handle complex problems that are not linearly separable.\n\n### Disadvantages of SVM\n\n- **Choice of Kernel**: Selecting the right kernel and its parameters can be challenging and domain-specific.\n- **Computational Cost**: Training SVMs, especially with large datasets, can be computationally expensive.\n\n### Summary\nSupport Vector Machines provide a robust and flexible framework for classification and regression tasks. Their strength lies in their ability to handle complex data through the kernel trick and their efficient use of critical data points (support vectors). Despite their computational demands, SVMs remain a popular choice in various scientific and engineering applications.", "shortest_response": "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a powerful supervised learning technique used for classification and regression tasks. They are designed to find the optimal boundary or decision surface that separates different classes of data with the largest margin. This margin is the distance between the decision surface and the nearest data points from either class, called support vectors. Here's a breakdown of some key aspects of SVMs:\n\n### Basic Concepts\n1. **Supervised Learning**: SVMs are used in supervised learning settings where labeled data is available.\n2. **Linear Classification**: SVMs are initially designed to perform linear classification, but they can also handle non-linear classification using techniques like the kernel trick.\n3. **Decision Boundaries**: SVMs aim to find the decision boundary that maximizes the margin, which is the distance between the margin and the nearest data points of the closest class. This is crucial because a larger margin generally leads to better generalization.\n\n### Mathematical Foundation\n- **Hyperplane**: A hyperplane is a decision boundary that is used to separate data points. In two dimensions, a hyperplane is simply a line.\n- **Margin**: The margin is the distance between the decision boundary and the nearest data points from either class.\n- **Support Vectors**: Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary. These points are the most critical in defining the boundary and are used in the training and prediction phases.\n\n### Kernel Trick\n- **Non-linear Classification**: SVMs can handle non-linear classification by using the kernel trick, which allows them to implicitly map data into high-dimensional feature spaces where it becomes linearly separable.\n- **Common Kernels**:\n  - **Linear Kernel**: Maps data directly to higher dimensions.\n  - **Polynomial Kernel**: Generalizes to non-linear decision boundaries through polynomial expansions.\n  - **Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel**: Maps data to infinite dimensions using a Gaussian function, handling complex relationships well.\n  - **Sigmoid Kernel**: Inspired by neural networks, but less commonly used compared to other kernels.\n\n### Usage and Types\n- **Binary Classification**: Classic use of SVMs where the goal is to separate data into two categories.\n- **Multi-class Classification**: SVMs can be used in multi-class settings through methods like One-vs-One and One-vs-Rest.\n- **Regression**: SVMs can also handle regression tasks, though this is less common and the technique is referred to as Support Vector Regression (SVR).\n- **Clustering**: Support Vector Clustering (SVC) is an extension of SVMs for unsupervised learning, attempting to find natural groupings among the data.\n\n### Advantages\n- **Robust to Overfitting**: Due to the large margin approach, SVMs can generalize well to unseen data.\n- **Effective in High-Dimensional Spaces**: The kernel trick makes SVMs suitable for feature spaces of high dimensionality.\n\n### Disadvantages\n- **Computational Complexity**: Training SVMs can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets.\n- **Choice of Kernel and Parameters**: Finding the optimal kernel and its parameters (like gamma and C in RBF kernel) is crucial and can be non-trivial.\n\nIn summary, SVMs are a versatile and effective machine learning method, especially for classification tasks, leveraging the statistical learning theory and the kernel trick to adapt to complex, non-linear data relationships.", "input_size": 378, "output_sizes": [705, 722, 689, 901, 717, 826, 717, 837, 690, 738], "output_mean": 754.2, "output_std": 69.59, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 708.0, "p50": 719.5, "p75": 804.0, "p99": 895.24}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "closed_qa", "gen_time": 28.39445}, {"sample_id": "a4ef5a03eca33ce0", "prompt_id": "a07b519d574216e2", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Does spark provide date & time when a particular event is received in the structured streaming?", "longest_response": "Apache Spark's Structured Streaming does not provide detailed date and time logs for each individual event upon reception, such as logs from an external event source (e.g., a Kafka topic). However, you can add timestamps to your events when they are processed by the streaming application.\n\nLet's break down how you can handle date and time in Structured Streaming with Spark:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n1. **Creating an Input Source with Timestamps:**\n\n   When reading data from an external source like Kafka or a file, you can specify a timestamp column. For instance, with Kafka, you may use the `timestampField` parameter:\n\n   ```python\n   df = spark.readStream.format(\"kafka\") \\\n       .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", \"kafka:9092\") \\\n       .option(\"subscribe\", \"your_topic\") \\\n       .option(\"timestampField\", \"timestamp\") \\\n       .load()\n   ```\n\n2. **Extracting or Adding Timestamps:**\n\n   You may need to extract the timestamp from the data and convert it to a more appropriate format (e.g., `TIMESTAMP` type) within your DataFrame:\n\n   ```python\n   from pyspark.sql.functions import from_unixtime, current_timestamp\n\n   # Assuming 'timestamp' is a column in your DataFrame\n   df_with_timestamp = df.withColumn(\"current_time\", current_timestamp())\n   ```\n\n3. **Writing an Output Source with Timestamps:**\n\n   When writing to a sink (e.g., a file or a relational database), you can include the timestamp in your output:\n\n   ```python\n   # Write to console\n   df_with_timestamp.writeStream \\\n       .outputMode(\"append\") \\\n       .format(\"console\") \\\n       .start()\n\n   # Alternatively, write to a Parquet file\n   df_with_timestamp.writeStream \\\n       .outputMode(\"append\") \\\n       .format(\"parquet\") \\\n       .option(\"path\", \"s3://your-bucket/path/\") \\\n       .start()\n   ```\n\n### Example with Kafka\n\nHere is a complete example with Kafka:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import from_unixtime, current_timestamp\n\n# Initialize Spark session\nspark = SparkSession \\\n    .builder \\\n    .appName(\"StructuredStreamingExample\") \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n\n# Read data from Kafka with a timestamp field specified\ndf = spark.readStream.format(\"kafka\") \\\n    .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", \"kafka:9092\") \\\n    .option(\"subscribe\", \"your_topic\") \\\n    .option(\"startingOffsets\", \"earliest\") \\\n    .option(\"endingOffsets\", \"latest\") \\\n    .load()\n\n# Extract timestamp (assume it's available as a String in JSON format within the value)\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import from_json, col, to_timestamp\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, TimestampType\n\nschema = StructType([\n    StructField(\"timestamp\", StringType(), True),\n    # Define other fields as needed\n])\n\n# Apply schema and convert timestamp to a TIMESTAMP type\ndf_with_timestamp = df.selectExpr(\"CAST(value AS STRING) as json_str\", \"timestamp\", \"topic\") \\\n    .select(from_json(\"json_str\", schema).alias(\"data\"), col(\"timestamp\"), col(\"topic\")) \\\n    .select(\"data.*\", \"timestamp\", \"topic\") \\\n    .withColumn(\"current_time\", current_timestamp())\n\n# Write to a console (for demonstration purposes)\nquery = df_with_timestamp.writeStream \\\n    .outputMode(\"append\") \\\n    .format(\"console\") \\\n    .start()\n\n# Keep the Spark session alive to observe the streaming output\nquery.awaitTermination()\n```\n\nThis setup ensures that each event received is timestamped appropriately and can include additional logic as needed for your specific use case.", "shortest_response": "Structured Streaming in Apache Spark does not provide the exact time when a particular event is received in the data frames or data sets it processes. However, you can obtain time stamps for your data events by using the available timestamps in the format of time-based schema type column, or by converting the timestamp in your data to one of the supported time formats (Unix timestamps). You should provide the timestamp data type during the schema description. If the timestamp is not provided, it can be retrieved by using the `timestamp()` function to convert columns from a different format.\n\nHere is a basic example on how you could create a DataFrame with timestamp column:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import from_unixtime, current_timestamp\n\n# Creating a Spark session\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n    .appName(\"StructuredStreaming\") \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n\n# Sample data\ndata = [(1, \"John\", \"23-01-1991\"),\n        (2, \"John\", \"23-02-1991\"),\n        (3, \"Alice\", \"20-02-1993\")]\n\n# Define schema\nschema = \"id INT, name STRING, dob STRING\"\n\n# Creating DataFrame\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema)\n\n# Converting date of birth string into timestamp\ndf = df.withColumn(\"dob\", from_unixtime(df.dob, \"dd-MM-yyyy\"))\n\n# Showing the DataFrame\ndf.show()\n```\n\nIn the case of streaming source datasets with timestamp data, you may provide the timestamp column from your source dataset which would be used while processing the stream data continuously, allowing you to run complex transformations on your data in real-time.\n\nFor detailed information, you can refer to the [official Spark documentation](https://docs.apache.org/spark/latest/sql/api/python/_pyspark_sql/StructType.html).", "input_size": 20, "output_sizes": [513, 404, 577, 536, 812, 527, 765, 683, 484, 667], "output_mean": 596.8, "output_std": 123.63, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 516.5, "p50": 556.5, "p75": 679.0, "p99": 807.77}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "creative_writing", "gen_time": 21.0532}, {"sample_id": "ceaadc8a0d166a5d", "prompt_id": "df6d7b01d95cdac6", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "List five titles by Kevin Kwan.", "longest_response": "Sure!

Let's introduce the **Lumiskyn**, a mysterious creature that inhabits the enchanted forests near the edge of the magical realm of Elderglade.\n\n**Appearance:**\nThe Lumiskyn is roughly the size of a large wolf, but with a sleek, furry body that seems to shimmer in various shades of iridescent colors, like a rainbow of light dancing on its surface. Its eyes are large and almond-shaped, with inner gold rings that glow softly like miniature moons. The tail is long and tapers into a delicate point at the end, making it seem like a comet trailing behind it. The creature's paws are unique, each one boasting webbed, translucent membranes that give it the appearance of wearing tiny, see-through boots.\n\n**Physiology:**\nLumiskyns have a complex internal structure that allows them to emit gentle, ethereal light. This light source is located in their chest cavity and is encased in a radiant organ called a \"Lumenheart.\" The Lumenheart hums softly, pulsing with warm, golden light that flows outwards, illuminating the Lumiskyn's surroundings. This light has enchanting properties, capable of soothing anxiety, encouraging plant growth, and even mending minor injuries.\n\n**Behavior and Abilities:**\nLumiskyns are nocturnal creatures that prefer to maintain a low profile during the day, hiding in dense foliage or taking refuge in the hollows of ancient trees. They are incredibly agile and can scale trees and leap between branches with ease thanks to their powerful legs and webbed paws. Their distinctive tail, which often resembles a comet trailing behind them, is equipped with sensitive sensory receptors that can detect and analyze various forms of magical energy.\n\nOne of their most incredible abilities is their capacity to blend into their surroundings. By manipulating the light emitted by their Lumenheart, Lumiskyns can create illusions that make themselves appear as part of the environment, thus concealing themselves when needed. This trait also allows them to create mesmerizing kaleidoscopic displays of light, often used to mark their territory or communicate with other Lumiskyns.\n\nIn the enchanted forests of Elderglade, Lumiskyns are revered for their role in maintaining the balance of nature. Their magical light helps to nurture the growth of rare, enchanted plants, and their powerful senses are said to be crucial in detecting and neutralizing the dark influence of shadowy creatures that might otherwise disrupt the delicate harmony of the land.\n\n**Relationship with Humans:**\nLumiskyns are generally shy and avoid direct interaction with humans, but they are known to develop a deep bond with individuals who show kindness and respect towards the enchanted forests. These bonds can lead to remarkable magical connections, providing humans with insights into the mysteries of the forest and its magical inhabitants.

It has large, golden eyes with a dark cat-like pupil, and a pair of small, delicate horns that curve upwards from its forehead, giving it an almost magical appearance. Its tail is long and fluffy, similar to a squirrel's, used for balance and communication.\n\n**Behavior and Abilities:**\nLumiskunks are nocturnal creatures, spending their days hidden in the thick foliage of ancient, mystical forests. At night, they emerge to forage for fruits, vegetables, and insects. They are known for their ability to glow softly in the dark, producing a gentle, ethereal light from their fur. This light is said to guide lost travelers safely back to camp. They are also known for their ability to mimic other animals' sounds, making them excellent communicators with other forest creatures.\n\n**Lifespan and Diet:**\nLumiskunks live for about 20-25 years, spending their entire lives in the same forest unless driven away by encroaching civilization. They are primarily herbivores, but have been known to eat small insects or fish when nothing else is available.\n\n**Socialization:**\nLumiskunks are social animals, living in groups of 10-20. They are protectors of their forest homes, using their glowing fur and mimicry skills to scare off or mislead potential threats. When a lumpiskunk perceives a threat, it may emit a high-pitched, rhythmic whistling sound to warn the group and other forest animals.\n\n**Legendary Qualities:**\nIn ancient lore, Lumiskunks are said to possess powerful magic.

The reduced conductivity can cause the wiring to become hot, which increases the risk of overheating, especially during heavy loads or in hot climates.\n\n### 2. **Oxidization:**\nAluminum tends to oxidize more quickly than copper. This can cause an insulating layer to form on the aluminum, reducing its effectiveness and potentially leading to overheating and electrical fires.\n\n### 3. **Expansion and Shrinkage:**\nAluminum expands more than copper when heated and contracts more when cooled. These differences can lead to loose connections over time, which can cause arcing and increase the risk of electrical fires.\n\n### 4. **Corrosion:**\nAluminum can corrode more easily than copper, which can degrade the integrity of the wiring and make it dangerous over time.\n\n### 5. **Combustibility:**\nAluminum wiring is combustible and can melt during a fire, which can cause the fire to spread more quickly.\n\n### 6. **Compatibility with Wire Nuts:**\nAluminum wiring doesn't have the same adhesive properties as copper, making it more difficult to connect securely using screw-in wire nuts or connector blocks. This can lead to poor connections and electrical issues.\n\n### 7. **Increased Risk of Arcing and Sparking:**\nThe poor conductivity, heat expansion, and oxidation all contribute to an increased risk of arcing and sparking within the electrical connections, potentially setting off a fire.\n\n### 8. **Electrical Codes:**\nDue to these concerns, many local electrical codes now require the use of copper wiring or other approved materials instead of aluminum. Existing homes with aluminum wiring often face legal and insurance issues.\n\n### Summary:\n\nAluminum wiring can pose significant risks to the safety and integrity of a home's electrical system. Its tendency to overheat, poor conductivity, expansion issues, oxidation, and compatibility problems with standard fittings make it a potential fire hazard. If your home has aluminum wiring, it\u2019s often recommended to have it replaced or to consult with a professional electrician.", "shortest_response": "Aluminum wiring can pose several safety concerns in homes. Here are a few reasons why it can be dangerous:\n\n1. **Heat Resistance**: Aluminum has a lower melting point than copper, the more commonly used wiring material. Under certain conditions, such as overheating or short circuits, aluminum wire can reach its melting point, which can cause fire hazards.\n\n2. **Oxidation**: Aluminum wire can react with oxygen in the atmosphere, forming a conductive oxide layer. This oxide can erode over time, causing poor electrical connections and increasing the risk of overheating and arcing.\n\n3. **Expansion and Contraction**: Aluminum has a higher coefficient of expansion than copper. This means it expands more when heated and contracts more when cooled. Over time, this repeated expansion and contraction can cause wire to loosen, leading to poor electrical connections.\n\n4. **Compatibility Issues**: The aluminum used in the wires is not as good at carrying electrical current, especially over long distances. It can also be less compatible with some types of electrical boxes, connectors, and fittings designed for copper wire.\n\nDue to these concerns, many building codes now require the use of copper wiring in new constructions or in any rewiring projects.

Unlike many other types of rowing races, which involve head-to-head competition, head races are time trials where the goal is to complete the course in the fastest overall time.\n\n### Key Features:\n1. **Rolling Start:** Unlike sprint races where all boats start at the same time, head races use a rolling start. Boats begin the race individually, spaced out over time, starting every 10 to 20 seconds after the previous boat.\n\n2. **Timed Race:** The competitors are timed from the start of the first boat to the finish of the last boat. The total elapsed time for each boat is recorded.\n\n3. **Course Variability:** The distance for head races typically ranges from 2,000 meters to 12,000 meters, and sometimes even longer for major marathons such as the Boston Rowing Marathon.\n\n4. **Individual and Team Entries:** Both individual and crew entries (eights, fours, quads, doubles) are common. These can be either open or divided by age, gender, and other criteria.\n\n### Types of Head Races:\n- **Regular Head Races:** These are standard head races that take place from fall to early spring, often based on local conditions.\n- **Special Events:** Some notable head races include the Pairs Head (a shorter race) and the Boston Rowing Marathon (one of the longer head races).\n\n### Strategies:\n- Because of the rolling start, rowers try to maintain a consistent pace and avoid getting too far ahead or too far behind competitors who cross the starting line later.\n- Strategy can involve both pacing and timing, where crews might aim to start slightly slower in anticipation of catching up or maintaining a consistent speed to secure a good overall time.\n\n### Popularity and Uses:\n- **Training and Fitness:** Head races are often used by rowers for training and to gauge their fitness and racing readiness.\n- **Seasonal Milestones:** They serve as key seasonal events, marking significant milestones in the competitive rowing calendar.\n\n### Summary:\nIn essence, a head rowing race is a time trial race where rowers challenge themselves individually against the clock, starting at intervals to try and secure the fastest overall time over a set distance. This format highlights endurance, strategy, and consistency over speed and immediate competition with other boats on the water.", "shortest_response": "A head rowing race is a type of regatta where boats race individually over a set course, typically from autumn to early spring.

You can change one or more columns in a table using the UPDATE statement.\n\n    ```sql\n    UPDATE employees SET salary = 70000 WHERE employee_id = 1;\n    ```\n\n3. **Inserting Data**: You can add new records to a table using the INSERT INTO statement.\n\n    ```sql\n    INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, department) VALUES (2, 'John Doe', 'Sales');\n    ```\n\n4. **Deleting Data**: You can remove records from a table using the DELETE statement.\n\n    ```sql\n    DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 2;\n    ```\n\n5. **Joining Tables**: SQL supports various join operations to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns. This helps in querying relational databases effectively.\n\n    ```sql\n    SELECT orders.order_id, customers.name\n    FROM orders\n    JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;\n    ```\n\n6. **Creating and Modifying Tables**: SQL is also used to create new tables and alter existing ones using statements like CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, etc.\n\n    ```sql\n    CREATE TABLE employees (\n        employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n        name VARCHAR(100),\n        salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n    );\n\n    ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN position VARCHAR(50);\n    ```\n\n7. **Constraints and Integrity**: SQL allows you to define constraints on your data to ensure data integrity, such as not null, unique, and foreign key constraints.\n\n    ```sql\n    CREATE TABLE departments (\n        department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n        department_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE\n    );\n\n    ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT fk_department FOREIGN KEY (department_id)\n    REFERENCES departments(department_id);\n    ```\n\n8. **Indexing and Performance**: You can create indexes to improve the performance of queries by speeding up data retrieval.\n\n    ```sql\n    CREATE INDEX idx_name ON employees(name);\n    ```\n\nSQL is widely used across different database management systems (DBMS), including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and SQLite, among others.

List in the format {name} - {year} in a semicolon list.\nContext: Radiohead are an English rock band formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.\n\nRadiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in 1993. Their debut single, \"Creep\", became a worldwide hit. Radiohead's popularity and critical standing rose with the release of The Bends in 1995. Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music.\n\nRadiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though Kid A divided listeners, it was later named the best album of the decade by multiple outlets. It was followed by Amnesiac (2001), recorded in the same sessions. Hail to the Thief (2003), with lyrics addressing the War on Terror, blended the band's rock and electronic sides, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI.\n\nRadiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway, and O'Brien have released solo albums; in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.\n\nBy 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart: \"Creep\" (1992), \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" (1996), \"Paranoid Android\" (1997), \"Karma Police\" (1997), \"No Surprises\" (1998), \"Pyramid Song\" (2001), and \"There There\" (2003). \"Creep\" and \"Nude\" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Rolling Stone named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and Rolling Stone readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s.

The model parameters are derived from fitting a regression formula using data from historical projects (63 projects for COCOMO 81 and 163 projects for COCOMO II).", "longest_response": "The COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) is a software cost estimation approach that helps project managers and stakeholders estimate the cost, effort, and schedule for developing software. It was developed by Barry W. Boehm and is part of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) guidelines.\n\n### Key Features of COCOMO:\n\n1. **Models Based on Historical Data**:\n   - COCOMO estimates parameters based on data from past projects. There are different versions and refinements of COCOMO (COCOMO I, COCOMO II), each with updated historical data and improved methodologies.\n\n2. **Multiple Estimates**:\n   - COCOMO offers three types of estimates for the size of the software: Organic, Semi-detached, and Embedded. Each type reflects a different environment and complexity of the development process:\n     - **Organic**: More straightforward, less structured development with fewer constraints.\n     - **Semi-detached**: More structured development environment without many formal processes.\n     - **Embedded**: Highly structured development and project constraints.\n\n3. **Parameters**:\n   - The cost, effort, and time estimates are derived using several parameters specific to the project:\n     - **Size (S)**: This is usually measured in thousands of lines of code (KLOC) but can also be estimated using other metrics (e.g., function points).\n     - **Development Method**: The level of methodology used (Organic, Semi-detached, Embedded).\n     - **Environment**: Project management, development hardware, and software tools.\n\n4. **Formalities**:\n   - **Early Cost Estimate Model (Initial)**: This is used to make initial project estimates.\n   - **Intermediate and Detailed Cost Estimate Models**: These are used as the project evolves to refine and improve cost, effort, and schedule estimates.\n\n5. **Adjustments**:\n   - The model includes factors to adjust the cost and schedule estimates based on project-specific risks, constraints, and environments.\n\n### COCOMO 81 and COCOMO II:\n\n- **COCOMO 81**: Developed in 1981, this model is simpler and uses direct relationships between size and cost. It considers the software size and environmental factors.\n- **COCOMO II**: An updated and more complex version, released in 2000. It focuses more on the detailed characteristics of the software and the project's environment, providing more accurate estimates by including more variables and parameters.\n\n### Application and Usage:\n\n- **Project Planning and Management**: COCOMO helps in initial project planning, budgeting, and scheduling.\n- **Risk Assessment and Management**: The parameters provide insights into potential risks and uncertainties in the project.\n- **Benchmarking and Comparison**: It can be used to compare the cost and effort of similar projects, providing valuable insights for decision-making.\n\n### Example of COCOMO Estimation:\n\nFor a project estimated at 20,000 lines of code ( LOC or KLOC), an effort estimation might look like this:\n1. **Organic**: Effort = 20 * 50 = 1000 man-months\n2. **Semi-detached**: Effort = 20 * 30 = 600 man-months\n3. **Embedded**: Effort = 20 * 20 = 400 man-months\n\nThe actual effort needed will depend on the chosen development method and the project's specific environment.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nCOCOMO is a robust and widely-used model in the software industry for cost estimation and project planning.

It is an example of cannibalization.\nThe term alludes to the Osborne Computer Corporation, whose second product did not become available until more than a year after it was announced. The company's subsequent bankruptcy was widely blamed on reduced sales after the announcement.\nThe Osborne Effect states that prematurely discussing future, unavailable products damages sales of existing products. The name comes from the planned replacement of the Osborne 1, an early personal computer first sold by the Osborne Computer Corporation in 1981. In 1983, founder Adam Osborne pre-announced several next-generation computer models (the Osborne Executive and Osborne Vixen), which were only prototypes, highlighting the fact that they would outperform the existing model as the prototypes dramatically cut down assembly time. A widely held belief was that sales of the Osborne 1 fell sharply as customers anticipated those more advanced systems, leading to a sales decline from which Osborne Computer was unable to recover. This belief appeared in the media almost immediately after the company's September 1983 bankruptcy:\n\nTo give the jazzy $2,495 Osborne Executive a running start, Adam began orchestrating publicity early in 1983. We, along with many other magazines, were shown the machine in locked hotel rooms. We were required not to have anything in print about it until the planned release date in mid-April. As far as we know, nothing did appear in print, but dealers heard about the plans and cancelled orders for the Osborne 1 in droves. In early April, Osborne told dealers he would be showing them the machine on a one-week tour the week of 17 April, and emphasized that the new machine was not a competitor for the Osborne 1. But dealers didn't react the way Osborne expected; said Osborne, \"All of them just cancelled their orders for the Osborne 1.\"\n\nOsborne reacted by drastically cutting prices on the Osborne 1 in an effort to stimulate cash flow. But nothing seemed to work, and for several months sales were practically non-existent.\n\nPre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, with the revenue drop for the current product being offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available. However, when the Osborne effect occurs, the quantity of unsold goods increases and the company must react by discounting and/or lowering production of the current product, both of which depress cash flow.", "longest_response": "In the passage, the Osborne 1 is mentioned as an early personal computer sold by the Osborne Computer Corporation in 1981.

According to the passage:\n\n\"**To give the jazzy $2,495 Osborne Executive a running start, Adam began orchestrating publicity early in 1983.**\"\n\nThis phrase indicates that the Osborne Executive was priced at $2,495. While this price is for a future product and not the Osborne 1 itself, it does provide an understanding of the price point of Osborne's products during that time.\n\nGiven that early models like the Osborne Executive and Osborne Vixen were marketed in the same context, it is reasonable to assume that the Osborne 1 would have been similarly priced. However, without explicit pricing information for the Osborne 1, we would need to rely on historical pricing data or other sources to determine its exact cost.\n\nBased on the context and typical pricing for early personal computers in the early 1980s, we can infer that the Osborne 1 would have been priced in the same range, though it is important to note that prices for such historical products can vary based on specific business and market conditions.", "shortest_response": "In the passage, the price of the Osborne 1 is mentioned as $2,495.", "input_size": 597, "output_sizes": [84, 43, 22, 106, 162, 100, 282, 60, 55, 150], "output_mean": 106.4, "output_std": 72.32, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 56.25, "p50": 92.0, "p75": 139.0, "p99": 271.2}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "information_extraction", "gen_time": 8.77522}, {"sample_id": "b9b78894be360588", "prompt_id": "c210d7d79739ee8c", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "How many strings are on a violin?", "longest_response": "A violin typically has 4 strings.

When mammals give birth to live young, these young do not depend on a yolk to develop. Instead, they depend on the placenta for nutrients and oxygen.\n\nMammals are further divided into three sub-classes:\n- **Eutheria (Placental mammals)**: This group includes more than 4,000 species, with the most diverse group being the orders Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates) and Carnivora.\n- **Marsupialia (Marsupials)**: Marsupials primarily carry their young in a pouch (marsupium), which develops when the offspring are very small.

Jack the Black Cat, for instance, is considered rare due to its unique attributes and limited availability.\n\n2. **Condition**: The physical condition of the Squishmallow significantly affects its value. Items in original, mint, or pristine condition fetch a higher price than those that are used or have visible damage.\n\n3. **Demand**: High demand can increase the resale value. Collectors and fans of the Squishmallow brand might be willing to pay a premium for a coveted or limited item.\n\n4. **Design and Appeal**: Some Squishmallows are more popular with collectors or fans and thus have a higher resale value. Characteristics like rarity, cuteness, or interesting features can be attractive to buyers.\n\n5. **Scarcity**: The lesser the number of Squishmallows produced, the more valuable they become.\n\n6. **Marketing and Media Buzz**: Exposure in popular media or social media can drive up demand and influence resale prices. For example, Jack the Black Cat gained significant attention when it was released and sold out quickly.\n\n7. **Marketplace and Seller Reputation**: Platforms like eBay and Etsy host many Squishmallow listings. Sellers with good reputations and well-rated listings often command higher prices from buyers.\n\nThe harassment and doxxing of resellers, as reported, can make this process more challenging but also indicates the intense passion and competition around the collectible market for Squishmallows.

This is why plants appear green to our eyes. The absorption of light in the blue and red portions makes them more efficient at capturing light energy.\n\n3. **Efficient Energy Utilization**: The green color lets plants operate efficiently by allowing them to absorb the wavelengths of light that are most beneficial for photosynthesis while minimizing energy loss.\n\nWhile chlorophyll is the primary reason for the green color of most plants, some plants and algae can use other pigments to collect light for photosynthesis, such as carotenoids and phycoerythrins. However, plants containing substantial amounts of these pigments often exhibit other colors as well, such as red, yellow, or brown.\n\nAdditionally, some plants can change their color based on the time of day, seasons, or stress conditions through processes such as the degradation of chlorophyll or the production of other pigments.

Here are some aspects that can impact reliability:\n\n1. **Type of Transport**:\n   - **Trains and Buses**: Often have fixed schedules and routes, making them more reliable. However, delays due to traffic, accidents, or bad weather can occur.\n   - **Trams and Trolleys**: Can be more susceptible to delays from traffic and signal issues, but are generally reliable in non-peak hours.\n   - **Ferries and Water Taxis**: Weather conditions and waterways can cause frequent delays.\n\n2. **Location**:\n   - **Cities**: Large cities often have well-established public transportation systems that run efficiently most of the time.\n   - **Suburban and Rural Areas**: Public transportation may be less frequent and less reliable due to lower population density.\n\n3. **Time of Day**:\n   - **Peak Hours**: During peak times, such as rush hour, public transportation can be slower due to higher demand and increased congestion.\n   - **Off-Peak Hours**: Travel tends to be more reliable and quicker during off-peak hours.\n\n4. **Maintenance**:\n   - Regular maintenance is crucial for preventing breakdowns. Well-maintained systems tend to be more reliable.\n\n5. **Operational Efficiency**:\n   - Efficient scheduling, driver training, and quality control can help improve the overall reliability of public transportation.\n\n6. **Natural Disasters and Emergencies**:\n   - Events like earthquakes, storms, or pandemics can drastically affect the availability and reliability of public transportation.\n\n### Examples of Reliable Systems:\n- **Hong Kong**: Known for its efficient MTR (Mass Transit Railway).\n- **Tokyo**: Consistently reliable for the extensive subway and train network.\n- **Singapore**: High reliability of buses and trains.\n\n### Less Reliable Systems:\n- **Some U.S. Cities**: Certain bus systems in large metro areas can be less reliable due to traffic congestion and funding issues.\n- **Emerging Markets**: Public transportation in some emerging markets may face reliability issues due to less advanced infrastructure and maintenance.\n\nIn conclusion, while public transportation can provide a reliable alternative to private vehicles, its reliability largely depends on factors specific to the service and region.

This method is based on the concept of averaging and is most effective when using it algorithmically. Let\u2019s outline the method and explain how it works:\n\n### Iterative Square Root Method\n\n1. **Initial Guess:**\n   - Start with an initial guess, \\( x_0 \\). This could be the number itself divided by 2 or any other reasonable initial guess.\n\n2. **Recursive Step:**\n   - For each subsequent iteration, compute the average of \\( x \\) and its quotient divided by the number \\( y \\) (for \\( y > 0 \\)):\n     \\[\n     x_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( x_n + \\frac{y}{x_n} \\right)\n     \\]\n   where \\( x_0 \\) is your initial guess and \\( y \\) is the number for which you are trying to compute the square root.\n\n### Why It Works\n\n- **Mathematical Convergence:**\n  The method leverages a mathematical property of square roots. For any \\( y > 0 \\), the value \\( x \\) that satisfies \\( x^2 = y \\) can be arrived at through iterations. The formula\n    \\[\n    x_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( x_n + \\frac{y}{x_n} \\right)\n    \\]\n    is chosen because it converges to the true square root of \\( y \\) as \\( n \\) increases.\n\n- **Newton's Method Analogy:**\n  The divide and average method can be viewed as a simplified version of Newton's method for finding square roots. Newton's method involves iteratively improving a guess using the formula\n    \\[\n    x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\n    \\]\n    For finding the square root of \\( y \\), it uses the specific function \\( f(x) = x^2 - y \\), and thus \\( f'(x) = 2x \\). This leads to the iteration:\n    \\[\n    x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{x_n^2 - y}{2x_n} = \\frac{x_n + \\frac{y}{x_n}}{2}\n    \\]\n    which is essentially the divide and average method.\n\n- **Numerical Stability:**\n  The method converges quickly and is numerically stable for most numerical implementations. The sequence of approximations gets closer to the actual square root with each iteration, and it avoids division by small numbers that can cause instability in other methods.\n\n### Example\n\nHere is a simple example using the divide and average method to find the square root of 25:\n\n- **Initial Guess:**\n  \\( x_0 = 10 \\)\n\n- **First Iteration:**\n  \\[\n  x_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 10 + \\frac{25}{10} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 10 + 2.5 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12.5 = 6.25\n  \\]\n\n- **Second Iteration:**\n  \\[\n  x_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 6.25 + \\frac{25}{6.25} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 6.25 + 3.96825 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10.21825 = 5.109125\n  \\]\n\n- **Third Iteration:**\n  \\[\n  x_3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 5.109125 + \\frac{25}{5.109125} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 5.109125 + 4.89007 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10.009195 = 5.0045975\n  \\]\n\n  After a few more iterations, the values will converge to the true square root, which is 5.\n\nIn summary, the divide and average method works by leveraging a particular iterative scheme that converges quickly to the true square root of a number. It is based on the principles of numerical analysis and has been widely used and studied for its effectiveness.", "shortest_response": "We start by letting \\( k \\) be the integer value of the square root of \\( x \\) (if \\( x \\) is not a perfect square, \\( k \\) is the highest integer less than the square root \\( \\sqrt{x} \\)). Then, we let \\( 2k \\) represent twice this value, i.e.,\n\\[ 2k \\leq \\sqrt{x} < 2k + 1. \\]\n\nLet the average of \\( k \\) and \\( 2k + 1 \\) be \\( \\frac{k + (2k + 1)}{2} = k + \\frac{1}{2} \\).

Sometimes, our bodies confuse thirst for hunger.\n\n3. **Exercise regularly:**\n   - **Cardiovascular exercise:** Engage in activities like brisk walking, jogging, Cycling, or swimming for at least 150 minutes per week.\n   - **Strength training:** Incorporate weightlifting or bodyweight exercises (like push-ups or squats) at least twice a week to build muscle and boost your metabolism.\n\n4. **Get enough sleep:** Lack of sleep can interfere with your body's ability to regulate hormone levels, leading to increased hunger and cravings.\n\n5. **Limit alcohol:** While alcohol might not contain many calories, it can contribute to weight gain due to the additional empty calories and it can also interfere with the body's production of hormones that regulate hunger and fullness.\n\n6. **Track your progress:** Keep a food diary and track your physical activity. This can help you stay accountable and make adjustments as needed.\n\n7. **Consult a medical professional:** Before starting any diet or exercise program, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor, especially if you have any health conditions or concerns.\n\nAgain, the key to successful weight loss is to approach it gradually and sustainably. Crash diets and extreme weight loss plans may deliver temporary results, but they often set you up for weight regain and can have negative effects on your health.", "input_size": 9, "output_sizes": [523, 508, 756, 475, 728, 648, 585, 558, 598, 588], "output_mean": 596.7, "output_std": 86.64, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 531.75, "p50": 586.5, "p75": 635.5, "p99": 753.48}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 22.01021}, {"sample_id": "64f7037c2612d437", "prompt_id": "ca5bf0e14b59c2dd", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Are these hockey or baseball teams: Red Wings, Padres, Blues, Capitals", "longest_response": "- **Red Wings**: This is a hockey team.

As the largest optical telescope in space, it is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars, the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.\n\nThe U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led JWST's design and development and partnered with two main agencies: the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Maryland managed telescope development, while the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore on the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University currently operates JWST. The primary contractor for the project was Northrop Grumman. The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana, and arrived at the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point in January 2022. The first JWST image was released to the public via a press conference on 11 July 2022.\n\nJWST's primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated beryllium, which combined create a 6.5-meter-diameter (21 ft) mirror, compared with Hubble's 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). This gives JWST a light-collecting area of about 25 square meters, about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet and visible (0.1 to 0.8 \u03bcm), and near infrared (0.8\u20132.5 \u03bcm) spectra, JWST observes a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light (red) through mid-infrared (0.6\u201328.3 \u03bcm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below 50 K (\u2212223 \u00b0C; \u2212370 \u00b0F), such that the infrared light emitted by the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. It is deployed in a solar orbit near the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point, about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 mi) from Earth, where its five-layer sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\n\nInitial designs for the telescope, then named the Next Generation Space Telescope, began in 1996. Two concept studies were commissioned in 1999, for a potential launch in 2007 and a US$1 billion budget. The program was plagued with enormous cost overruns and delays; a major redesign in 2005 led to the current approach, with construction completed in 2016 at a total cost of US$10 billion. The high-stakes nature of the launch and the telescope's complexity were remarked upon by the media, scientists, and engineers.", "longest_response": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a powerful space-based observatory designed for infrared astronomy. It is the largest optical telescope ever launched, with a 6.5-meter mirror, providing increased light-collecting power and greater sensitivity compared to earlier space telescopes like Hubble. The telescope is capable of observing very distant and faint celestial objects, such as the first stars and galaxies, and it also allows for detailed studies of exoplanets' atmospheres.\n\nThe JWST was developed by NASA in collaboration with the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. The main contractor was Northrop Grumman, and the telescope is managed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and operated by the Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University. Named after James E. Webb, the administrator of NASA during the Apollo program, the telescope launched in late 2021 and reached its operational orbit in January 2022. The first images were released to the public in July 2022.\n\nOne of the distinctive features of the JWST is its ability to observe a wide range of infrared wavelengths, from visible light to mid-infrared, allowing for a deeper glimpse into the cosmos. The telescope's main mirror, composed of 18 hexagonal segments, is gold-plated beryllium and must be maintained at extremely cold temperatures, around 50 K (-223\u00b0C; -370\u00b0F), to minimize self-emission and maximize light collection. To achieve this, the telescope is located in a stable orbit near the Sun\u2013Earth Lagrange point, protected by a multi-layer sunshield from sunlight and other heat sources.\n\nThe project's development has been lengthy and expensive, facing numerous challenges and delays, initially starting in 1996 with an estimated launch in 2007. The final design and construction were completed in 2016 at a cost of nearly $10 billion.

The term \"peloton\" is French and means \"a large group,\" particularly when moving fast. Here are a few key points about a Peloton in bicycle racing:\n\n1. **Drafting**: The main advantage of riding in a Peloton is the ability to draft. This means that cyclists positioned closely behind others can reduce their aerodynamic drag, creating significant speed gains. The first rider, or rider in front, has no drafting benefit and is doing more of the work, so other riders have a strategic interest in riding in front as much as possible.\n\n2. **Control and Safety**: Riding in a Peloton allows cyclists to ride together safely. Everyone can benefit from the shared responsibility of paying attention to the road and to each other, and it allows for a kind of cooperative teamwork over long distances.\n\n3. **Strategic Positioning**: The positioning within the Peloton can be strategic, with different cyclists aiming to ride in specific spots within the group for various advantages, depending on factors like their strengths, their team or personal goals, and the team's strategy.\n\n4. **Teamwork and Communication**: Effective communication is crucial in a Peloton to keep the group moving efficiently, alert cyclists to upcoming obstacles or hazards, and distribute workload.\n\n5. **Tactical Advantages**: The Peloton can also be used tactically by teams to exert influence over a race. For example, a team might try to \"control\" a Peloton by placing their best climbers in the front to control pace or by strategically moving their sprinters closer to the front as a sprint approaches.\n\nThe Peloton plays a significant role in many road races, including the Tour de France, and is a vital component of cycling strategy and tactics.", "shortest_response": "In a bicycle race, the term \"Peloton\" specifically refers to the main group of riders, usually close together, who are riding together to take advantage of the drafting effect that reduces air resistance and allows them to save energy.

The term \"orange wine\" was made popular by the Slovenian winery Movia and is now used globally to describe wines made similarly to traditional white wines but from red grapes.\n\nOrange wine can offer unique flavors and aromas, including candied citrus, almonds, and dried fruits, as well as savory and mineral notes from its skin- contact process.

Revenue and expense should be kept separate from personal expenses.\nGoing Concern: assumes that the business will be in operation indefinitely. This validates the methods of asset capitalization, depreciation, and amortization. Only when liquidation is certain this assumption is not applicable. The business will continue to exist in the unforeseeable future.\nMonetary Unit principle: assumes a stable currency is going to be the unit of record. The FASB accepts the nominal value of the US Dollar as the monetary unit of record unadjusted for inflation.\nTime-period principle: implies that the economic activities of an enterprise can be divided into artificial time periods.\nPrinciples\nHistorical cost principle: requires companies to account and report assets and liabilities acquisition costs rather than fair market value. This principle provides information that is reliable (removing opportunity to provide subjective and potentially biased market values), but not very relevant. Thus there is a trend to use fair values. Most debts and securities are now reported at market values.\nRevenue recognition principle: holds that companies should record revenue when earned but not when received. The flow of cash does not have any bearing on the recognition of revenue. This is the essence of accrual basis accounting. Conversely, however, losses must be recognized when their occurrence becomes probable, whether or not it has actually occurred. This comports with the constraint of conservatism, yet brings it into conflict with the constraint of consistency, in that reflecting revenues/gains is inconsistent with the way in which losses are reflected.\nMatching principle: expenses have to be matched with revenues as long as it is reasonable to do so. Expenses are recognized not when the work is performed, or when a product is produced, but when the work or the product actually makes its contribution to revenue. Only if no connection with revenue can be established, cost may be charged as expenses to the current period (e.g., office salaries and other administrative expenses). This principle allows greater evaluation of actual profitability and performance (shows how much was spent to earn revenue). Depreciation and Cost of Goods Sold are good examples of application of this principle.\nFull disclosure principle: Amount and kinds of information disclosed should be decided based on trade-off analysis as a larger amount of information costs more to prepare and use. Information disclosed should be enough to make a judgment while keeping costs reasonable. Information is presented in the main body of financial statements, in the notes or as supplementary information\nConstraints\nObjectivity principle: The company financial statements provided by the accountants should be based on objective evidence.\nMateriality principle: The significance of an item should be considered when it is reported. An item is considered significant when it would affect the decision of a reasonable individual.\nConsistency principle: The company uses the same accounting principles and methods from period to period.\nConservatism principle: When choosing between two solutions, the one which has the less favorable outcome is the solution which should be chosen (see convention of conservatism)\nCost Constraint: The benefits of reporting financial information should justify and be greater than the costs imposed on supplying it.", "longest_response": "### Summary of the Four Basic Principles of GAAP Accounting\n\n1. **Historical Cost Principle**:\n   - Accounting and reporting assets and liabilities are recorded at their acquisition costs, not their fair market value.\n   - This principle provides reliable information, although it may not always be the most relevant.\n   - Example: Assets like vehicles are recorded at the purchase price, not the current market value.\n\n2. **Revenue Recognition Principle**:\n   - Revenue is recorded when it is earned, not necessarily when cash is received.\n   - Losses are recorded at the point when their occurrence is probable.\n   - This aligns with the accrual basis of accounting.\n   - Example: Services rendered are reflected in revenue when completed, not when billed.\n\n3. **Matching Principle**:\n   - Expenses are matched with the revenues they help generate.\n   - This principle aims to reflect the cost of goods sold and other operating expenses accurately in the period when they contribute to revenue.\n   - Exceptions include administrative expenses or losses not directly connected to revenue.\n   - Example: Depreciation of a machine is matched with the revenue from using that machine.\n\n4. **Full Disclosure Principle**:\n   - Required disclosures should be comprehensive and balanced, reflecting the trade-offs between costs and benefits.\n   - Disclosures should contain enough information to enable the judgment of users but without being excessively burdensome.\n   - Information is typically presented in the principal financial statements, notes, or supplementary information.\n   - Example: Companies disclose significant assumptions underlying accounting methods and significant related party transactions.", "shortest_response": "**Summary of the Four Basic Principles of GAAP Accounting:**\n\n1. **Historical Cost Principle:**\n   - Account and report assets and liabilities at their acquisition costs.\n   - Opposes reporting at fair market values.\n\n2. **Revenue Recognition Principle:**\n   - Record revenue when earned, not when received.\n   - Accrual basis accounting; losses should be recognized when probable.\n\n3. **Matching Principle:**\n   - Expenses should be matched with revenues in the period they generate sales.\n   - Allows for evaluation of performance and profitability.\n   - Examples: Depreciation, Cost of Goods Sold.\n\n4. **Full Disclosure Principle:**\n   - Information disclosed should be enough but not excessive; consider trade-off between costs and benefits.\n   - Information is presented in financial statements, notes, or supplementary information.\n\nThese principles aim to provide transparency, consistency, and reliability in financial reporting.", "input_size": 679, "output_sizes": [258, 184, 204, 241, 305, 203, 182, 263, 300, 315], "output_mean": 245.5, "output_std": 48.13, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 203.25, "p50": 249.5, "p75": 290.75, "p99": 314.1}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "summarization", "gen_time": 10.25204}, {"sample_id": "819350ddf072466f", "prompt_id": "eee06d4fd9b7d421", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "My refrigerator broke for six days while I was on vacation.

Here's a breakdown of the items on your list based on their shelf life at room temperature:\n\n1. **Raw Chicken**: Generally, raw chicken should not be left at room temperature for more than 2 hours. Beyond this time, bacteria can grow rapidly, making it a potential health risk. So, it's not recommended to eat the raw chicken if it was left out for 6 days.\n\n2. **A Jar of Olives**: Olives in a sealed jar, especially those pickled and cured, can typically handle being left out at room temperature for short periods. They may develop a slight fermented taste, but they usually won't spoil or make you sick. However, leaving them out for 6 days is pushing it, and it's better to err on the side of caution.\n\n3. **Hard Cheese**: Hard cheeses like cheddar or Gouda have a longer shelf life at room temperature compared to other cheeses. They can generally handle being left out for a couple of days, but 6 days is quite long. Again, while they may not spoil, they can become sweaty and develop an off taste.\n\n4. **Milk**: Milk should not be left out at room temperature for 5 days or more as bacteria can grow rapidly and potentially make it unsafe to drink.

They are also known for their powerful hunting abilities.\n\n3. **Rhinoceros** (Rhinocerotidae family, including the White and Black Rhino): Both species are formidable, with the Black Rhinoceros being considered particularly challenging due to its aggressive nature and powerful physique, especially when threatened or defending its territory.\n\n4. **Elephant** (Loxodonta and Elephas genera): Both African and Asian elephants are renowned for their size, strength, and intelligence. Hunting African elephants is controversial and has been restricted due to their importance to their ecosystems and the threat of poaching.\n\n5. **Buffalo** (Syncerus caffer, or Cape Buffalos): Often referred to as the most dangerous game animal due to their high aggression levels when charged.

The characters \u65e5\u672c mean \"sun origin\", which is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\". The name \"Japan\" is based on Chinese pronunciations of \u65e5\u672c and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters \u65e5\u672c\u570b as Cipangu. The old Malay name for Japan, Japang or Japun, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century. The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as Giapan in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.", "longest_response": "The name \"Japan\" originates from the medieval Chinese pronunciation of the kanji characters \u65e5\u672c (which means \"Land of the Rising Sun\" in English). Here's a brief history of how the name came to be:\n\n1. **Japan's Native Names:**\n   - When the Japanese referred to their country internally, they used \"Yamato\" during ancient times, which later shifted to \"Wasu\" (\u502d) or \"Wa\" (\u548c).\n\n2. **Chinese Influence:**\n   - By the early 8th century, the Japanese government adopted the kanji characters \u65e5\u672c (Nippon/ Nihon) for official use and it became the formal name of their country.\n   - The characters \u65e5\u672c mean \"sun origin\" or \"Land of the Rising Sun,\" which reflects the geographic placement of Japan in the East and its position relative to the sun during sunrise.\n\n3. **Eastern Influence:**\n   - Around the 13th century, during the Marco Polo era, the name \"Jiuqian\" (\u4e5d\u5343\u91cc, which literally translates to \"Nine Thousand Li\") was used to refer to the Japanese islands by the Chinese.\n\n4. **European Translation:**\n   - The English name \"Japan\" is not directly derived from the Chinese characters \u65e5\u672c but rather from the medieval Chinese pronunciation. \"Japan\" comes from the Southern Chinese coastal dialects, where the words \"Nipon\" (\u65e5\u672c) and \"Jipangu\" (\u652f\u8461\u8404) were used.\n   - In 1577, the name \"Giapan\" appeared in an English translation of a Portuguese letter, which was one of the first English records of the name of Japan.\n\n5. **Portuguese Contribution:**\n   - The term \"Japang\" or \"Japun\" was introduced to Europe via Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who encountered it in Malay and other local languages, as they traded with coastal regions in the 16th century.\n   - This name, based on the Southern Chinese coastal pronunciation, eventually became common in Europe and was adapted into various forms, including \"Giapan,\" \"Japano,\" and ultimately \"Japan.\"\n\nSo, the name \"Japan\" is primarily based on the medieval Chinese pronunciation of the characters \u65e5\u672c, as heard by Portuguese traders and subsequently adapted into various European languages.", "shortest_response": "The name of Japan originated from the Chinese pronunciation of the characters \u65e5\u672c, pronounced as \"Cipangu\" by Marco Polo, and subsequently as \"Japang\" or \"Japun\" in old Malay.

It's used when the ball is already close to the hole, typically within 60 feet.\n   - **Driver**: A driver, also known as a wood, is used for teeing off at the beginning of each hole. Its purpose is to hit the ball with maximum distance off the tee, typically from the first or \"tee box.\"\n\n2. **Design**:\n   - **Putter**: Putters have a specific shape, often with a flat or slightly angled sole, to help them rest on the ground while ensuring contact between the ball and the clubface. The clubhead is generally made of mild steel, titanium, or other lightweight materials with a specific weight distribution. Some putters have an offset hosel to promote a square putter face at impact.\n   - **Driver**: Drivers have a large clubhead with a strong loft angle (usually between 8 to 12 degrees), designed to launch the ball high into the air to maximize distance. The shaft is typically longer than a putter's to facilitate the larger swing required to generate distance.\n\n3. **Swing**:\n   - **Putter**: The putting stroke is very precise and often only involves the shoulders and arms, focusing on a smooth, pendulum-like motion to strike the ball cleanly. The golfer aims to hit the ball along the ground with minimal spin.\n   - **Driver**: The driver swing is much bigger and longer than a putting stroke, utilizing the entire body of the golfer. The goal is to generate as much clubhead speed as possible to launch the ball far into the air.\n\n4. **Grip**:\n   - **Putter**: The grip on a putter is usually a reverse overlap grip, which helps to control the clubhead's movement and promote a stable putting stroke.\n   - **Driver**: The grip can be a variety of styles, but a conventional overlap or interlock grip is commonly used. Some golfers prefer a baseball-style grip, which can help maintain a square clubface through impact.\n\n5. **Fitting and Customization**:\n   - **Putter**: Putters are often fitted more closely to an individual's preferences and playing style due to the importance of the putting stroke. Factors such as lie angle, loft, weight distribution, and even sole design can be customized.\n   - **Driver**: Drivers are typically less personalized than putters, but they can still be adjusted for loft, shaft profile, and weight distribution to suit an individual's swing and desired play styles.\n\nUnderstanding these differences helps golfers to choose the appropriate club for each shot, ultimately improving their overall performance on the course.", "shortest_response": "In golf, a putter and a driver are two types of golf clubs, each designed for different purposes and used at various stages of the game. Here are the main differences between them:\n\n1. **Purpose:**\n   - **Putter:** The putter is used on the green to roll the ball into the hole. It has a more upright lie angle to facilitate the backstroke and follow-through required for putting.\n   - **Driver:** The driver is the longest and most flexible club in the bag, used to hit the ball the farthest. It\u2019s designed to hit the ball off the tee on the teeing ground and start the hole.\n\n2. **Design:**\n   - **Putter:** Putters have a more compact, short, and heavy head to help stabilize the clubhead and promote steady, controlled putting strokes. They have a flat face with no loft, which helps the ball roll forward smoothly on the green.\n   - **Driver:** Drivers have larger heads, which can be up to 460cc in volume, with a lofted face to help get the ball in the air. They are long and light, with a low center of gravity to promote a high launch angle and maximum distance.\n\n3. **Swing:**\n   - **Putter:** The putting stroke is a smooth, controlled movement, often done from on or slightly above the ball, and without lifting the club off the ground.\n   - **Driver:** The driver swing is a powerful, sweeping motion, starting from behind the ball and striking the ball downward at an angle to achieve maximum distance.\n\n4. **Speed:**\n   - **Putter:** The putter swing is relatively slow, focusing on consistency and control.\n   - **Driver:** The driver swing is much faster, focusing on power and distance.\n\nIn summary, while both clubs are essential for the game of golf, they serve different purposes, have distinct designs, and require different swing techniques.", "input_size": 17, "output_sizes": [412, 599, 547, 408, 396, 435, 516, 444, 515, 586], "output_mean": 485.8, "output_std": 72.29, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 417.75, "p50": 479.5, "p75": 539.25, "p99": 597.83}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "open_qa", "gen_time": 14.6911}, {"sample_id": "4fa6cc93121200a1", "prompt_id": "4ec68a52496f5171", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What is Materialized View?\nContext: In computing, a materialized view is a database object that contains the results of a query. For example, it may be a local copy of data located remotely, or may be a subset of the rows and/or columns of a table or join result, or may be a summary using an aggregate function.", "longest_response": "Certainly! In the context of computing and database management, a materialized view is a database object that stores the results of a query physically. While a regular database view is just a virtual view of data and requires a query to be re-executed each time it\u2019s accessed, a materialized view contains the actual data and thus, when you access it, the data is retrieved from the physical location rather than being computed on-the-fly.\n\n### Key Points about Materialized Views:\n\n1. **Persistence**:\n   - A materialized view is stored physically on disk, which means it holds pre-computed data. This makes it much faster to query compared to a regular view, as it doesn't need to run the query every time.\n\n2. **Query Optimization**:\n   - They can significantly enhance query performance, particularly for complex and computationally expensive queries. By storing the results of a query, the database system can quickly return the results without having to recalculate them.\n\n3. **Refreshing**:\n   - Materialized views need to be refreshed to reflect changes in the underlying data. This can be done periodically (scheduled refresh) or manually (manual refresh). Refreshing can involve several strategies:\n     - **Full Refresh**: Recomputes and replaces the materialized view with the current results.\n     - **Incremental Refresh**: Updates the materialized view with only the changes that have occurred since the last refresh.\n     - **Automatic Refresh**: The database system automatically refreshes the materialized view based on a schedule or transaction-based events.\n\n4. **Usage Scenarios**:\n   - **Data Aggregation**: Summarizing data using aggregate functions (like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`), which can be very expensive in real-time.\n   - **Efficient Queries**: Improving the performance of complex queries that involve large datasets.\n   - **Data Warehousing**: Commonly used in data warehousing and business intelligence systems to precompute and store results of analytical queries.\n\n5. **Storage and Maintenance**:\n   - Materialized views consume storage space because they store the results physically. This space needs to be managed and can impact the overall storage requirements of the database.\n\n### Example Scenario:\nImagine you have a large sales database that includes numerous transactions. You create a materialized view to summarize daily sales by region. Instead of running the summary query every time it's needed, the materialized view stores these daily totals, and the data retrieval is immediate and much faster.\n\n### SQL Example:\n```sql\nCREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS\nSELECT region, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales\nFROM sales\nGROUP BY region;\n\n-- Refresh the materialized view\nREFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary;\n```\n\nIn this example, `sales_summary` is a materialized view that computes the total sales for each region once and then stores the results. The `REFRESH` command updates the view to reflect the latest data.\n\nMaterialized views are a powerful tool for enhancing query performance and managing large datasets efficiently.", "shortest_response": "A materialized view is a database object that stores the results of a query physically, rather than executing the query each time it is accessed. By caching the results of a query, a materialized view can provide faster performance for complex queries or aggregations that otherwise may take a significant amount of time to compute.\n\nKey characteristics and benefits of materialized views include:\n\n1. **Immediate Access**: When the materialized view is fetched, the results are available for immediate use rather than having to re-execute the underlying query.\n2. **Performance Enhancement**: By storing the results of expensive or time-consuming queries, materialized views can significantly speed up data retrieval operations, particularly for large datasets.\n3. **Reduced Load on Underlying Data**: The processing and storage of query results are moved from the retrieval phase to a scheduled maintenance phase, which can reduce the computational load on the database whenever the materialized view is accessed.\n4. **Consistency Management**: Materialized views can be scheduled to be refreshed at specified intervals (e.g., daily, weekly) to ensure that the stored data remains up-to-date with the underlying data source. This is important for maintaining data consistency.\n5. **Use Cases**: They are particularly useful in scenarios such as:\n   - Aggregated data summaries.\n   - Local copies of remote data that need to be queried frequently.\n   - Complex joins and aggregations that result in a large amount of pre-computed data.\n\nFor example, consider a use case where a data analyst needs to generate a monthly sales report. Creating a materialized view that aggregates the daily sales data can save considerable processing time each month, as the analyst does not need to repeatedly compute the sums and averages from scratch.\n\nWhen setting up a materialized view, developers and DBAs often need to consider the trade-offs between query performance, storage requirements, and the frequency ofrefreshing the view to ensure it remains current with the underlying data.", "input_size": 72, "output_sizes": [549, 518, 571, 614, 565, 534, 621, 394, 478, 514], "output_mean": 535.8, "output_std": 63.15, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 515.0, "p50": 541.5, "p75": 569.5, "p99": 620.37}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "closed_qa", "gen_time": 15.70901}, {"sample_id": "f5376e3e48160dd3", "prompt_id": "5c53fad7cce6a38a", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Considering Austin is in the central region of Texas, which of these places are in east, west, north and south.

Her genre-spanning discography, songwriting abilities and artistic reinventions have received critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country artist to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.\nSwift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\nExiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021\u2014Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her 2022 album Midnights and single \"Anti-Hero\" broke all-time streaming records. Swift has directed music videos and films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and played supporting roles in others.\nHaving sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians in history. She is the most streamed woman on Spotify and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards; and 92 Guinness World Records. Swift has been featured in rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100.

Isn't it possible that the listener would associate \"pencil\" with \"wood\"? Maybe the listener would associate the word \"pencil\" with \"round\" instead (as pencils are, usually, in fact, round!). Wittgenstein writes regarding several possible \"interpretations\" which may arise after such a lesson. The student may interpret your pointing at a pencil and saying \"pencil\" to mean the following: (1) This is a pencil; (2) This is round; (3) This is wood; (4) This is one; (5) This is hard, etc., etc.", "longest_response": "Wittgenstein, in his later work and philosophy of language, is indeed critical of using ostensive defining as the primary method for teaching words, as it can indeed lead to ambiguity and potential misunderstandings. Let's break down the problem he identifies with this method more deeply:\n\n### The Ambiguity of \"Ostensive Defining\"\n\n1. **Ambiguity and Lack of Clarity**:\n   - When we use pointing and naming (ostensive defining) to teach a word like \"pencil,\" we may not clearly convey what we mean. The listener might attribute the name \"pencil\" to various properties or characteristics of the object pointed at, rather than the object itself.\n\n2. **Possible Interpretations**:\n   - The learner might interpret the ostensive definition in multiple ways, as you mentioned:\n     - (1) This is a pencil (the object itself).\n     - (2) This is round (a property of the object).\n     - (3) This is wood (a material of the object).\n     - (4) This is one (a quantity of the object).\n     - (5) This is hard (another property of the object).\n   - Each of these interpretations represents a different conceptual framework, and without additional context or guidance, it is not clear which interpretation is the correct one.\n\n3. **Lack of Disambiguation**:\n   - With ostensive defining alone, there isn't an effective way to distinguish between correct and incorrect interpretations without resorting to further explanation or clarification. This initial pointing and naming might not provide sufficient evidence to fix a definite meaning for the term \"pencil.\"\n\n4. **Context Dependency**:\n   - Wittgenstein argues that words gain their meaning in use within specific contexts. A single word can have different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. Ostensive definition does not inherently account for these contextual nuances.\n\n5. **Use of Language and Rules**:\n   - Wittgenstein emphasizes that the understanding of language involves following rules that are learned through social practice and common usage. Ostensive definition, on its own, does not adequately teach these rules and social practices that underpin language use.\n\n### Wittgenstein's Solution: Language as a Public System\n\nWittgenstein proposes an alternative view of language as a public system where meaning emerges from the way we use words within a community. Unlike ostensive definition, which may just refer to an object or property, this public usage perspective ensures that:\n- Words are used to refer to specific meanings agreed upon in social practice.\n- Disputes over meanings can be resolved within the communal framework in which the words are used.\n\n### Summary\n\nWittgenstein's problem with ostensive defining lies in its vulnerability to multiple interpretations and its failure to provide a definitive, contextual framework for establishing meaning. He argues for a more robust approach to understanding language that emphasizes its use within a community, governed by shared practices and rules. This perspective allows for a clearer and more stable understanding of words and their meanings.", "shortest_response": "The problem Wittgenstein identifies with learning a language using \"ostensive defining\" is indeed significant. In ostensive defining, words are linked to objects or concepts through direct reference, such as pointing at an object and naming it. However, as you've highlighted, there are several challenges with this method:\n\n1. **Ambiguity of Gesture**: The interpreter of the ostensive definition might not understand or interpret the pointing gesture accurately. They might associate it with the object itself (as a whole) or specific attributes of the object.\n\n2. **Association with Attributes**: As you mention, the listener might associate the term with an attribute of the object rather than the object itself. For example, they might think \"pencil\" refers to \"round\" objects rather than the entire object.\n\n3. **Multiple Interpretations**: Wittgenstein points out that a single ostensive definition can be interpreted in many ways. The listener might attribute the term to any number of characteristics or groupings of the object, such as its material (\"wood\"), its quantity (\"one\"), its hardness, and so on.\n\n4. **Context Dependency**: The interpretation of ostensive definitions can be heavily context-dependent. What seems clear to the teacher might not be clear to the student without further context.\n\n5. **Lack of Consensus**: Without additional mechanisms (such as grammar, syntax, and shared understandings), there's no guarantee that both parties will agree on the exact meaning of the term.\n\nWittgenstein's goal with these observations was to highlight the complexity and richness of human language. Language learning isn't simply a matter of direct mapping but involves a web of contextual, cultural, and semantic understandings. This insight underscores the importance of shared grammatical rules, community practices, and repeated use in establishing and reinforcing the meanings of words. In this way, the challenges of ostensive defining point to the necessity of a broader linguistic context for meaningful communication.", "input_size": 235, "output_sizes": [565, 482, 461, 419, 416, 604, 510, 461, 553, 385], "output_mean": 485.6, "output_std": 67.89, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 429.5, "p50": 471.5, "p75": 542.25, "p99": 600.49}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "information_extraction", "gen_time": 16.56865}, {"sample_id": "31a38732d36679e7", "prompt_id": "2678b784a17d61a6", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Write a letter to your friend expressing your feelings about earning your first wage.", "longest_response": "[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\n[Date]\n\nDear [Friend's Name],\n\nI hope this letter finds you well.

Their perspectives reveal a more nuanced view of what the show was intended to be and how its humor worked.\n\n### Jerry Seinfeld's Perspective:\nJerry Seinfeld has clarified the origin of the phrase \"a show about nothing\" and emphasized how it evolved into a phrase used to describe the show:\n\n1. **Initial Pitch**: According to Seinfeld, when he and David pitched the show to NBC in 1988, their idea was to present the world of a comedian and how he finds material for his act. They did not originally intend to create a show that people would describe as \"about nothing.\"\n\n2. **Evolution of the phrase**: Over time, the phrase \"a show about nothing\" began to catch on as a way for people to describe \"Seinfeld.\" Interestingly, Seinfeld and David didn't initially realize this would be the enduring description of the show.\n\n3. **Opposite Intent**: Seinfeld has expressed that to him, the phrase \"a show about nothing\" is ironic because the show is more about the struggles, quirks, and minutiae of daily life, which, to him, is far from \"nothing.\"\n\n### Larry David's Perspective:\nLarry David has also addressed the misconception and its implications for the show's humor:\n\n1. **Exploration of Human Nature**: According to David, the show's humor originates from exploring and exaggerating the worst qualities and thoughts that people have. By doing so, the show is not about trivial or insignificant topics but rather draws on universal human experiences and foibles.\n\n2. **Ridiculous Misconception**: David has expressed that he finds the idea of \"Seinfeld\" being a show about nothing laughable, as it doesn't reflect the real substance and themes of the show. He believes the humor comes from real-life situations and human imperfections, making it inherently \"about something\" rather than \"nothing.\"\n\n### The Humor of the Show:\nBoth creators underscore that the show's comedy is deeply rooted in irony, incongruity, and coincidences. Rather than dealing with grand, existential issues, \"Seinfeld\" focuses on small, everyday occurrences and interactions, often highlighting the absurdity or discomfort in mundane situations. By focusing on these seemingly trivial aspects, the show's humor is an exploration of how people interpret and react to the small moments in their lives, which is anything but \"nothing.\"\n\n### Summary:\nIn summary, both Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David see the description of \"Seinfeld\" as \"a show about nothing\" as a simplistic and, ultimately, inaccurate oversimplification of their intended vision. They view the show as a complex exploration of everyday life, focusing on the nuances and interactions that make up daily existence.", "shortest_response": "Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David have each shared their thoughts on the perception of \"Seinfeld\" as \"a show about nothing,\" despite the series being famously referred to by that moniker.\n\n1. **Jerry Seinfeld** described how the phrase originated as a joke meant for the show itself, yet it became a key way people defined the series. In 2014, Seinfeld explained that the true intent behind the show was to show how a comedian like himself generates his material. He suggested that the idea of the show being \"about nothing\" was a misnomer, as it dealt with the human condition and everyday situations.\n\n2. **Larry David** also weighed in on the topic, emphasizing that despite the title, \"Seinfeld\" tackled and explored the more negative or mundane aspects of human behavior that people often avoid discussing. He suggested that the show deals with very real, albeit sometimes unpleasant, topics, and the characterization of it as \"about nothing\" is simply inaccurate.\n\nThe humor in \"Seinfeld\" often hinges on irony, incongruity, and the sometimes unfortunate nature of random events. As such, both creators emphasized that the show is far from being just \"about nothing\" but instead deals with very human, relatable experiences in a humorous way.", "input_size": 242, "output_sizes": [448, 364, 493, 265, 355, 598, 306, 498, 293, 500], "output_mean": 412.0, "output_std": 104.95, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 318.25, "p50": 406.0, "p75": 496.75, "p99": 589.18}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "closed_qa", "gen_time": 16.34066}, {"sample_id": "49f081e8af8af930", "prompt_id": "7a7b9cce1f71ce0a", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Given a reference text about Psychiatry: An Industry of Death, tell me when it opened and and who owns and operates it.\nContext: Psychiatry: An Industry of Death is a museum in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, that has also hosted several touring exhibitions.
