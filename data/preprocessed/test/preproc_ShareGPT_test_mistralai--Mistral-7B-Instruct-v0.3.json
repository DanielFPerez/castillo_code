You can write platform-specific code in Swift or Kotlin within your iOS and Android projects, and interact with this code from your Flutter code.\n\nHere are some steps to get started:\n\n1. Create a Flutter app and open it in your favorite IDE (Android Studio or Xcode).\n\n2. Create a new native iOS or Android project, or reuse an existing one. This project will contain the native code that will be called from the Flutter app.\n\n3. Set up platform channels:\n\nFor Android, in your `android/app/src/main/java/[your-package-name]/MainActivity.java`, import necessary packages and create a channel using a static method:\n\n```java\nimport io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity;\nimport io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine;\nimport io.flutter.plugin.common.MethodChannel;\n\npublic class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {\n\n    final static String CHANNEL = \"samples.flutter.dev/battery\";\n\n    private MethodChannel _channel;\n\n    @Override\n    public void configureFlutterEngine(@NonNull FlutterEngine flutterEngine) {\n        _channel = new MethodChannel(flutterEngine.getDartExecutor(), CHANNEL);\n        _channel.setMethodCallHandler(\n          new MethodCallHandler() {\n            @Override\n            public void onMethodCall(@NonNull MethodCall call, @NonNull Result result) {\n                if (call.method.equals(\"getBatteryLevel\")) {\n                    result.success(getBatteryLevel());\n                } else {\n                    result.notImplemented();\n                }\n            }\n          }\n        );\n    }\n\n    private int getBatteryLevel() {\n        // Add implementation for getting battery level here.\n        // Return a fake value for now.\n        return 50;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor iOS, in your `[your-project]/ios/[your-app-name]/AppDelegate.m`, import necessary packages and create a channel:\n\n```objective-c\n#import <Flutter/Flutter.h>\n#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>\n\n@implementation AppDelegate\n\nNSString * const channelName = @\"com.example.FlutterBattery\";\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\n    GENERATED_FLUTTER_APPLICATION_METHOD_Implementation\n\n    [FlutterViewController setInitialMethodChannelName:channelName];\n\n    // Pass the channel from your Flutter code back to the native app using a callback.\n\n    return YES;\n}\n\n- (void)generateFlutterEngine:(NSString *)channelName withChannelHandler:(void (^)(id<FlutterChannelRegistry>))channelHandler {\n    FlutterEngine* engine = [[FlutterEngine alloc] initWithName:channelName];\n    [engine addPluginRegistrantWithRegistry:self];\n\n    NSDictionary* arguments = @{ @\"argumentsKey\": @\"value\" };\n    MethodChannel* channel = [FlutterMethodChannel methodChannelWithName:channelName on:[engine defaultFlutterEngine] options:arguments];\n    channelHandler(engine.dartEngine.binaryMessenger.getMethodChannelRegistry());\n}\n\n- (void)channelCreated:(FlutterChannelRegistry *)channelRegistry forChannel:(NSString *)channel {\n    if ([channel isEqual:channelName]) {\n        [channel setInvokeHandler:^(NSInteger arg1, NSString *arg2, NSArray<id> *arg3) {\n            NSLog(@\"Battery level: %ld\", arg1);\n        }];\n    }\n}\n\n@end\n```\n\n4.

However, this attachment can sometimes become a hindrance, causing stress and difficulties in decision-making. Here are some strategies that might help you manage attachment to remaining possibilities:\n\n1. Acknowledge your feelings: Recognize and accept that you are feeling attached to these possibilities. Acknowledging your feelings is the first step towards understanding and managing them.\n2. Analyze your attachment rationally: Reflect on the reasons behind your attachment to these possibilities. Is it because of their perceived benefits, or their emotional significance? By understanding the root of your attachment, you can better address it.\n3. Broaden your perspective: Try to consider alternative options that you might have overlooked due to your attachment. Seek advice from others, read reports, do research, and explore new avenues. A broader perspective can help you make a more informed decision.\n4. Practice detachment: This doesn't mean detaching yourself from your feelings, but rather, detaching from the outcome. Understand that the universe has a plan for you, and whatever happens, will happen for the best. Visualize your potential options disappearing one by one, and embrace the unknown with a sense of curiosity, rather than fear.\n5. Let go of perfection: Understand that there is no such thing as a perfect choice. All options have their pros and cons, and it's up to you to decide which one fits best with your overall goals and values. Letting go of the need for perfection can help you make a decision with more ease.\n6. Focus on your values: Remember why you are making this decision in the first place. Reflect on your core values and principles, and choose the option that aligns best with them. Your values should guide your decision-making process, not your attachment to a specific outcome.\n7. Take action: Once you've made a decision, commit to it wholeheartedly. Don't second-guess yourself or dwell on what could have been. Take action, learn from your experiences, and move forward.\n8. Practise self-care: This is essential when dealing with stress and anxiety related to decision-making. Make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as reading, exercising, or spending time with loved ones. Taking care of your physical and emotional well-being will help you navigate this challenging period with more clarity and resilience.\n9. Stay open to change: Be flexible and open to change, even after you've made a decision. Life is unpredictable, and new opportunities may present themselves down the line. Remain adaptable and embrace changes as they come.\n\nUltimately, managing attachment to remaining possibilities is a process of understanding yourself, learning to let go, and trusting in the universe's plan for you. Keep a growth mindset, and remember that making mistakes is an essential part of the learning process. Good luck with your decision-making journey!", "shortest_response": "It sounds like you're dealing with a common issue, especially in decision-making, where the fewer options left, the more attached and anxious one might feel. This phenomenon is known as \"The Paradox of Choice\" or decision-making paralysis.\n\nHere are a few strategies that might help:\n\n1. **Understand the roots of your attachment**: Try to identify why you're feeling so attached to the remaining possibilities. Is it because they align with your values, goals, or personal preferences? Or perhaps they offer a sense of security or comfort? Understanding the root cause can help you approach the situation more mindfully.\n\n2. **Embrace the impermanence of decisions**: Remind yourself that every decision is a step towards a new direction, and that it's okay to change your mind if something doesn't work out. This can help reduce the pressure you're putting on your decision and allow you to approach it with more flexibility.\n\n3. **Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness can help manage anxiety and stress, helping you make decisions with clarity and calmness. Take a few deep breaths, focus on the present moment, and try to observe your thoughts and emotions without judgment.\n\n4. **Consider the potential outcomes**: Write down the pros and cons of each option, or imagine what your life might look like if you chose each one. This can help you make a more informed decision based on logical thinking rather than attachment.\n\n5. **Seek advice**: Talk to trusted friends, family members, or mentors about your situation. Sometimes, an outside perspective can help you see things more clearly.", "input_size": 51, "output_sizes": [369, 365, 369, 367, 485, 524, 433, 473, 346, 642], "output_mean": 437.3, "output_std": 89.9, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 367.5, "p50": 401.0, "p75": 482.0, "p99": 631.38}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 14.82656}, {"sample_id": "f99c331fcc180380", "prompt_id": "3ad8056e8e786289", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Design the optimal pytorch model to classify MNIST handwritten digit database", "longest_response": "To design an optimal Pytorch model for classifying the MNIST handwritten digit database, we can use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Here's an example of a simple yet effective CNN model:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass LeNet5(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(LeNet5, self).__init__()\n        self.conv1 = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Conv2d(in_channels=1, out_channels=6, kernel_size=5, padding=2),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)\n        )\n        self.conv2 = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Conv2d(in_channels=6, out_channels=16, kernel_size=5, padding=2),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)\n        )\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)\n        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.conv1(x)\n        x = x.view(-1, 6 * 5 * 5)\n        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))\n        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))\n        x = self.fc3(x)\n        return F.log_softmax(x, dim=1)\n\nmodel = LeNet5()\n```\n\nThis LeNet5 model consists of two convolutional layers followed by two fully connected layers. To make it more applicable for the MNIST dataset, we modify the model by changing the number of output channels, kernel sizes, padding, and activation functions, which are designed based on the original LeNet-5 architecture.\n\nThe input shape is `(1, 28, 28)`, representing a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels. After the first convolutional layer, the spatial dimensions are reduced to 24x24 pixels. The number of input channels is 6 since we have 6 filter weights for each of the 5x5 convolution kernels and one bias term.\n\nAfter the first convolutional layer, we perform a ReLU activation function and max-pooling with a kernel size of 2x2 and a stride of 2, which reduces the spatial dimensions to 12x12 pixels. Similarly, this process is repeated for the second convolutional layer, resulting in 8x8 pixels spatial dimensions.\n\nFollowing the two convolutional layers, we have a fully connected layer with 120 neurons (`16 * 5 * 5` is the output size of the second convolutional layer). After applying the ReLU activation function, we have another fully connected layer with 84 neurons before the final layer with 10 neurons, each corresponding to a digit from 0 to 9.\n\nFinally, you can train this model using the MNIST dataset available in the torchvision library and the appropriate loss function and optimizer (e.g., CrossEntropyLoss and Adam, respectively).\n\n```python\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\nfrom torchvision.datasets import MNIST\nfrom torchvision.transforms import ToTensor, Normalize\n\n# Load and Normalize the MNIST dataset\ntrain_data = MNIST(root='./data', train=True, transform=transforms.Compose([\n                    ToTensor(),\n                    Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))\n                 ]), download=True)\ntest_data = MNIST(root='./data', train=False, transform=transforms.Compose([\n                   ToTensor(),\n                   Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))\n                  ]), download=True)\n\n# Define the train and test data loaders\nbatch_size = 64\ntrain_loader = DataLoader(train_data, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)\ntest_loader = DataLoader(test_data, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)\n\n# Loss function and optimizer\nloss_fn = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\noptimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)\n\n# Train the model\nepochs = 10\nfor epoch in range(epochs):\n    running_loss = 0.0\n    for i, data in enumerate(train_loader, 0):\n        inputs, labels = data\n\n        # Zero the parameter gradients\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\n\n        # Forward pass\n        outputs = model(inputs)\n        loss = loss_fn(outputs, labels)\n        loss.backward()\n\n        # Update parameters\n        optimizer.step()\n\n        # Calculate running loss\n        running_loss += loss.item()\n    print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1}, Loss: {running_loss / (i + 1)}')\n```\n\nThis basic structure should provide a good starting point for achieving high accuracy on the MNIST dataset.

Firstly, make sure you have Playwright and its test runner installed in your project:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev playwright\n```\n\n2. Create a test suite or add your test files to the `tests` directory if you haven't already:\n\n```\nmkdir tests\n```\n\n3. Update `package.json` to include a script for running playwright tests:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"playwright test\",\n    \"playwright:serve\": \"playwright serve\",\n    \"playwright:test:ci\": \"PLAYWRIGHT_NO_OPEN=true playwright test --headed --reporter=dot\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. In this example, I added three scripts:\n\n- `test`: This will run the playwright tests in interactive mode and open the browser windows.\n- `playwright:serve`: This will serve your project for Playwright tests or end-to-end tests. Note that this is useful when you're writing tests against a local development server.\n- `playwright:test:ci`: This is a headless test runner, which is useful in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment where no user interaction should be involved. The `--reporter=dot` flag makes output simpler and easier to parse for CI systems.\n\n5. Now you can run the tests using various scripts provided in `package.json`, such as:\n\n```\nnpm run test             // Interactive tests (Default)\nnpm run playwright:serve // Serve the project for tests\nnpm run playwright:test:ci // Run headless tests for CI\n```\n\nTo run these scripts from the `Executor` of the `project.json` (which is actually `tasks.json` for Visual Studio Code), follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`, `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and search for and select \"Tasks: Configure Task...\".\n2. In the `Tasks` section, click on the \"Add Task\" button.\n3. Fill in the fields provided according to the scripts you have in the `package.json`:\n\n- Task Name: `npm test` (or whatever you want the name to be)\n- Task Definition: `${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/npm`\n- Arguments: `run test`\n\nRepeat steps 2 and 3 for the other scripts you defined in the `package.json`, adjusting the `Arguments` value accordingly.\n\n4. Add any custom options that you may require for the test runner, such as the `--browser` flag to specify the browser, or the `--skip-localhost` flag to avoid testing localhost sites on CI.\n\n5.

You've managed to stumble your way into the realm of beauty and now you think you can just waltz in here, untrained and unprepared, and expect us to teach you the ways of makeup? Well, I'm here to save you from the utter embarrassment you're about to face. So listen up, because I'm only explaining this once.\n\n**1. Skin Prep:**\nFirst things first, you need to clean your face. No, not with soap and water. You need a proper cleanser, you dingbat. Wash it, tone it, and moisturize it. It's called a skincare routine, and it's not optional. If you show up to the party with dirty, flaky skin, you might as well just stay at home.\n\n**2. Primer:**\nIf you don't know what a primer is, well honey, you're truly lost. A primer is a magical product that creates a smooth, flawless canvas for your makeup. It's not some optional step you can skip because your skin is \"good\" - because trust me, it's not. Apply it evenly using your fingers or a little brush.\n\n**3. Foundation:**\nNow comes the foundation \u2013 the very essence of your entire look. You must choose a foundation that matches your skin tone *perfectly* and not the shade that's one step lighter because you think it'll make you look more tan. Apply it with a brush or a beauty blender, making sure to blend it into your neck so there's no line between your face and your body.\n\n**4. Concealer:**\nNext, you need a concealer. This is for hiding those pesky imperfections \u2013 spots, darkness, etc. Use it in a triangular shape under your eyes, and on any blemishes. DON'T overdo it \u2013 we don't want you looking like you've been hit by a truck.\n\n**5. Powder:**\nTime for some powder, sweetie. This will set your foundation and concealer, ensuring they don't slip and slide off your face throughout the day. Apply it lightly using a brush, focusing on areas prone to shine like your T-zone.\n\n**6. Eyebrows:**\nYour eyebrows are crucial to your overall look, and they're certainly not as negligible as you may think. Fill them in lightly using a brow pencil or powder to define their shape and add some depth. Don't go crazy with the drawing \u2013 you're not trying to look like an overplucked panda bear.\n\n**7. Eyeshadow:**\nNow we move on to eyeshadow, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of your eyes. For beginners, start with a neutral shade all over your lid, followed by a darker shade in the crease for definition. Blend, blend, blend! If you can't blend, don't even bother trying.\n\n**8. Eyeliner:**\nEyeliner is your secret weapon, and it's what will make your eyes pop. Start at the inner corner of your eye, and draw a thin line as close to your lash line as possible, winging out slightly at the ends. Fill in the rest of your lash line, being careful not to smudge it.\n\n**9. Mascara:**\nApply a couple of coats of mascara to your top and bottom lashes, separating your lashes as you go. If your lashes are sparse or short, invest in some falsies. God knows you could use all the help you can get.\n\n**10. Lips:**\nFinally, we come to the lips. Opt for a neutral lipstick or balm for the first time, and make sure to line your lips with a lipliner so the lipstick stays put throughout the day. If you want to be really bold, you can try a bolder lipstick shade in the future, but for now, just stick to the basics.\n\nAnd there you have it, your very first foray into the world of makeup. Now go out there, and for the love of all things beautiful, don't disappoint me.", "shortest_response": "Alright, dimwit, let's get this over with. You're about to enter the world of cosmetics, and it's time to wise up if you want to fit in. First things first, you'll need a few essentials: a primer, foundation, concealer, powder, blush, mascara, eyeliner, and lipstick.\n\n1. Primer: Slap on a handful of this sticky goop all over your face. It'll give your makeup something to cling to, you know, in case you have any trace of a decent complexion left.\n\n2. Foundation: Dab a generous amount of this stuff on your face with your fingers or a sponge. Make sure to blend it properly to cover up any remaining freckles or natural beauty - we can't have that, now can we?\n\n3. Concealer: If you've got dark circles under your eyes (probably from staying up late binge-watching trashy reality TV), slather some concealer on those baggy eyes. Just don't expect it to fully erase them, because magic doesn't work that way, darling.\n\n4. Powder: Next, sweep some powder all over your face to set your foundation. This will help your makeup stay put for a few extra hours as you attempt to navigate the complex social dynamics of high school.\n\n5. Blush: To add a bit of color to your pale, unremarkable face, sweep some blush along the apples of your cheeks. But don't go overboard - you don't want to look like a tomato or anything.\n\n6. Eyeliner: Line your eyes with a thin, but noticeable line of eyeliner. If you're feeling particularly ambitious, you can try winging it out at the corner. Just make sure you don't mess it up - because trust me, it's a lot harder to fix than your own self-esteem.\n\n7. Mascara: Apply a few coats of mascara to your lashes, focusing on the outer corners. This will make your eyes pop a bit more, which might help you stand out from the sea of mediocrity.\n\n8. Lipstick: Smear some lipstick on your lips to seal the deal. Try to go for a bold, statement-making color, but remember, too much of anything is never a good look.\n\nAnd that's it! You're now halfway presentable for your first day of school. Just remember to keep practicing, because mastering the art of makeup takes time and patience - qualities that must have eluded you in your unfortunate genetics.

This dialectical method, like other dialectical approaches, relies on a contradictory process between opposing sides.\n\nHowever, to fully understand Hegel's dialectic, it is essential to consider the broader context of his philosophy as it pertains to history, as described on Philosophy Now. According to Hegel, history is a continuous process that encompasses everyone and everything, and it is not just a collection of dates, battles, and events but an unfolding of logic [[2](https://philosophynow.org/issues/140/Hegels_Understanding_of_History)]. His dialectical method allows the progression of ideas, societal structures, and logic throughout history. The dialectical process within Hegel's philosophy involves the movement from an initial thesis, followed by the emergence of antithesis, and ultimately leading to a synthesis that reconciles and supersedes the initial opposing ideas.\n\nSome of the most important concepts of Hegel's dialectic include the master-slave dialectic, the concept of \"spirit\" (Geist), and the unfolding of the Absolute Idea, which signifies the evolution of reason and consciousness through human history. By applying dialectic reasoning to various aspects of human thought and experience, Hegel sought to demonstrate the necessary progression of historical stages, and ultimately, the development of freedom and self-consciousness.", "shortest_response": "Hegel's dialectic refers to the philosophical method of argumentation developed by the 19th-century German philosopher, G.W.F.

I want to restrict access to the website only from authorised devices. How do I do that?", "longest_response": "Restricting access to your mobile website from unauthorized devices involves implementing a multi-layered approach using a combination of techniques. Here are some steps you can consider:\n\n1. Registration and authentication: Implement a user registration and authentication process to allow only registered users to access your website. You can use technologies like OAuth or OpenID Connect for simplified authentication.\n\n2. Device registration: To take it a step further, you can implement device registration. When a user logs in for the first time, capture essential device details (e.g., device ID, OS version, browser details) and link those details to the user account. Later, the website can check if the user's device is registered and whether its details match the stored information.\n\n3. One-time password (OTP):Send an OTP to the user's registered mobile phone number each time they try to log in. This added step can help ensure that only the person who has access to the user's phone can log in, even if someone else knows the user's login credentials.\n\n4. Geolocation: You can use Geolocation APIs to check the user's location. If the access is attempted from an unexpected or unauthorized location, you can deny access, provide an extra security layer, or send a verification code to the user's registered address or phone number.\n\n5. Device identification: You can use technologies such as DeviceAtlas, WURFL, or Adobe Device Central (DC) to identify and classify the user's device. If an unrecognized device tries to access the site, you can restrict access or prompt the user to confirm their identity.\n\n6. Behavioral analysis: Implement behavioral analytics to learn the user's normal behavior patterns when using the website. If someone with a registered account performs unusual activities (e.g., frequent failed login attempts, uncommon access times, or interactions outside the user's normal behavior patterns), you can deny access, send alerts, or request the user to confirm their identity.\n\n7. CAPTCHA or 2FA: Use CAPTCHA or two-factor authentication (2FA) to further enhance security. This can help ensure that access is not granted to bots or scripts that may try to bypass your security measures.\n\nKeep in mind that while these measures can help secure your mobile website, no solution is perfect. Always remain vigilant and keep your security practices up-to-date to protect against changing threats.", "shortest_response": "Implementing device authorization for a mobile website can be complex due to the diverse nature of mobile devices and operating systems. However, here are some approaches you can consider:\n\n1. **User Registration and Device Registration:** Allow users to register, and when they log in for the first time, generate a unique key for their device. Store this key associated with the user's account. When the user tries to access the website from a new device, require them to enter the unique key.\n\n2. **Fingerprinting:** Use device fingerprinting to identify unique details about the user's device such as OS version, screen resolution, installed fonts, installed plug-ins, and their combination to create a unique identifying \"fingerprint.\" Compare this fingerprint with the list of authorized devices.\n\n3. **Device IDs:** Some mobile platforms allow you to access the unique device IDs (e.g., Android's AndroidID, Apple's UDID). However, use these with caution because of privacy concerns and the fact that these identifiers can sometimes be changed.\n\n4. **IP Whitelisting:** Whitelist the IP addresses of authorized devices. This method can be effective, but it might not work for users with dynamic IP addresses or those using mobile networks, as their IP address can change frequently.\n\n5. **OTP and Biometrics:** For a high level of security, consider sending One-Time Passwords (OTPs) to the user's registered number or implementing biometric authentication (if the mobile devices support it).\n\nRemember, no single method is foolproof, and combining multiple approaches can increase the security of your mobile website. Moreover, it's important to keep in mind the privacy concerns of your users and comply with relevant data protection laws and regulations.

Additionally, the patient's comorbid diagnoses of hypertension and diabetes may influence his response to medication and overall well-being.\n\nPsychological factors: The patient's limited coping skills and negative cognitive distortions may be maintaining his depressed and anxious mood. These thought patterns, as well as any underlying unresolved emotional issues, should be addressed through therapy.\n\nSocial factors: The patient's supportive family and stable home environment may serve as protective factors against worsening symptoms. However, it is important to consider any potential stressors or life changes that may be contributing to his current mental state.\n\nFREUDIAN ANALYSIS: In light of the patient's family history, it is possible that unresolved issues related to his relationships with his mother and father are contributing to his depressive and anxious symptoms.

This essay will critically examine the argument that these destructive arsenals contribute positively to the world at large, ultimately concluding that such a claim is fundamentally flawed and potentially detrimental to the sustainable enhancement of global security.\n\nAdvocates of the nuclear deterrent argue that these weapons have served as an effective bulwark against aggression, deterring potential adversaries from launching large-scale attacks. One oft-cited example is the Cold War standoff between the United States and Soviet Union, during which the existence of mutually assured destruction (MAD) prevented a full-scale conflict from escalating (Glantz & Mills, 1998). However, this example, while illustrating the theory of deterrence, falls short of establishing a positive impact on global security. In fact, the Cold War era was characterized by an arms race that led to the proliferation of nuclear arsenals, heightening tensions and creating a constant state of instability (Gorbachev, 1996).\n\nMoreover, the very existence of nuclear weapons in the hands of unstable regimes or non-state actors poses a grave threat to global security. Nuclear proliferation, far from contributing to stability, increases the risk of a catastrophic nuclear conflict. The potential for nuclear terrorism, the destabilizing effects of regional nuclear arms races, and the escalation of conventional conflicts into nuclear ones are all significant concerns (Sagan & Waltz, 1995).\n\nFurthermore, the costs associated with the maintenance, upgrading, and modernization of nuclear weapons infrastructures divert resources that could be allocated towards addressing pressing global issues such as poverty, climate change, and public health crises. The disproportionate nuclear spending by nations like the United States and Russia, for instance, is a missed opportunity to invest in sustainable development and peacebuilding initiatives (ICAN, 2017).\n\nIn contrast, disarmament and non-proliferation efforts have shown significant promise in contributing to global security. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), for example, has been instrumental in curbing the spread of nuclear weapons, while encouraging nuclear-weapon states to work towards disarmament (UNODA, 2021). The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) likewise seeks to prevent nuclear terrorism and the development of new nuclear weapons by prohibiting all nuclear explosive tests (CTBTO, 2021).\n\nIn conclusion, while the argument that nuclear weapons contribute positively to global security may find some support in specific historical contexts, it is ultimately a flawed and dangerous assertion. The existential threat posed by nuclear weapons, coupled with the diversion of resources from vital global initiatives, makes their continued existence a hindrance to genuine efforts towards building a safer and more secure world. Instead, the global community should focus on disarmament, non-proliferation, and conflict resolution as the key pillars of ensuring a more peaceful and secure future.\n\nReferences:\n\nCTBTO.

This essay aims to critically evaluate the argument that nuclear weapons benefit the world at large, considering both affirmative and negative aspects, and ultimately concluding that the potential for catastrophic destruction far outweighs any perceived advantages.\n\nThe Argument for Nuclear Weapons:\n\nAdvocates of nuclear weapons maintain that thesearms serve as a potent deterrent, preventing large-scale conflicts and ensuring global peace (Glaser, 2006). For instance, the nuclear arsenal of the United States and the Soviet Union (now Russia) during the Cold War is often cited as having minimized direct military confrontation between the two superpowers, despite the tense political climate. However, this argument is largely theoretical, as the use of nuclear weapons during that period was averted through diplomatic measures and the MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) doctrine.\n\nThe Counterargument:\n\nCritics argue that the mere existence of nuclear weapons introduces an unacceptable level of risk, outweighing any putative benefits. The devastating humanitarian consequences of nuclear detonation, such as the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, serve as stark reminders of the catastrophic potential of these weapons (Graham, 2008). Furthermore, the proliferation of nuclear weapons to additional states increases the likelihood of their use, either through misunderstanding, miscalculation, or intentional aggression. The North Korean nuclear crisis and India-Pakistan tensions demonstrate the hazardous reality of a world with multiple nuclear powers.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, while it is possible to make a case for the deterrent value of nuclear weapons, their potential for mass devastation and the risk of proliferation render them a net negative for global security. The international community must prioritize nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts to safeguard humanity from the cataclysmic repercussions of nuclear conflict.

Here's an outline of the general process to get you started:\n\n1. **Understand ShareGPT and its functionality**: Familiarize yourself with how ShareGPT works, its features, and the JavaScript APIs it uses.\n\n2. **Familiarize yourself with Safari extension development**: Learn about the Safari Extensions WebKit Framework, Safari-specific APIs, and the iOS app extensions for Safari. You can find the documentation here: [Safari Extension Development Guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_extension_programming_guide) and [iOS App Extension Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating_an_app_extension).\n\n3. **Identify differences between Chrome and Safari APIs**: Understand the differences in available APIs for Chrome and Safari extensions. Some features and APIs only work on desktop Chrome, while others are exclusive to Safari. You may need to find alternatives or workarounds for functionalities that aren't supported on Safari.\n\n4. **Refactor the code**: Update the ShareGPT codebase to adhere to Safari's extension file structures and APIs. This might involve renaming and reorganizing files, modifying the manifest file, and replacing Chrome-specific methods with Safari equivalents.\n\n5. **Create a manifest.json file**: Create a new manifest.json file, which the Safari Extension framework uses to understand the basic properties and requirements of the extension. Consult the Safari Extension Development Guide to understand the required properties and format of the manifest file.\n\n6. **Test the extension**: After updating the code and manifest file, test the extension in Safari to make sure it functions correctly. You'll want to test it both on a Mac desktop and iOS device.\n\n7. **Test the iOS App Extension**: If your extension requires access to device capabilities only available through an app extension (e.g., accessing the camera or user location), ensure you follow the iOS App Extension Programming Guide for testing and deployment.\n\n8. **Submit the extension for review**: Once your extension is functional and thoroughly tested, you can submit it through App Store Connect for review by Apple. Follow the [submission guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/submit/) to ensure a smooth review process.\n\n9. **Maintain and update the extension**: Keep in mind that you'll want to maintain and update the extension to remain compatible with future versions of Safari and iOS. Stay informed about changes in the Safari Extensions WebKit Framework and iOS app extensions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to create a Safari extension based on the open-source ShareGPT project that can run on both iOS and macOS devices.

Here's a general guide on how to approach this:\n\n1. Familiarize yourself with the Safari Extensions documentation:\nApple provides clear guidelines and documentation for developing Safari extensions. Start by reading the Safari Extensions Programming Guide and the Web Extension API Reference.\n\n2. Understand the differences between Chrome and Safari extensions APIs:\nChrome and Safari extensions have different APIs and capabilities. For instance, Safari lacks some APIs like the tabs API, and it has its own content blocking API (Content Blocker). You'll need to adjust your extension's functionality accordingly.\n\n3. Recreate the extension structure for Safari:\nSafari extensions are built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a manifest file (extension.json). Start by creating the necessary files based on the structure provided by the ShareGPT project.\n\n4. Adapt the JavaScript code:\nModify the JavaScript code to use Safari-specific APIs and remove any Chrome-specific code. Since ShareGPT seems to be a content script injection extension, you'll need to focus on adapting the content scripts to work in a Safari context.\n\n5. Implement iOS-specific features:\nApart from adapting the extension to work in Safari, you may want to add iOS-specific features or adjust the UI to better fit an iPhone or iPad.\n\n6. Test and debug:\nTest your Safari extension on a physical iOS device or using the iOS Simulator within Xcode. Apple requires extensions to pass a review process before being distributed on the App Store.\n\n7.

Suppliers with strong bargaining power are a source of competitive pressure because of their ability to charge industry members higher prices, pass costs on to them, and limit their opportunities to find better deals. For instance, Microsoft and Intel, both of which supply PC makers with essential com- ponents, have been known to use their dominant market status not only to charge PC makers premium prices but also to leverage their power over PC makers in other ways. The bargaining power of these two companies over their customers is so great that both companies have faced antitrust charges on numerous occasions. Prior to a legal agree- ment ending the practice, Microsoft pressured PC makers to load only Microsoft prod- ucts on the PCs they shipped. Intel has defended itself against similar antitrust charges, but in filling orders for newly introduced Intel chips, it continues to give top priority to PC makers that use the biggest percentages of Intel chips in their PC models. Being on Intel\u2019s list of preferred customers helps a PC maker get an early allocation of Intel\u2019s latest chips and thus allows the PC maker to get new models to market ahead of rivals.\nSmall-scale retailers often must contend with the power of manufacturers whose products enjoy well-known brand names, since consumers expect to find these prod- ucts on the shelves of the retail stores where they shop. This provides the manufacturer with a degree of pricing power and often the ability to push hard for favorable shelf dis- plays. Supplier bargaining power is also a competitive factor in industries where unions have been able to organize the workforce (which supplies labor). Air pilot unions, for example, have employed their bargaining power to increase pilots\u2019 wages and benefits in the air transport industry. The growing clout of the largest healthcare union in the United States has led to better wages and working conditions in nursing homes.", "longest_response": "Memorized: Competitive Pressures Stemming from Supplier Bargaining Power\n\nSupplier bargaining power can be a significant competitive force, influencing the terms and conditions of supply.

This approach allows the design of complex and functional geometry in an efficient manner, suitable for computer aided manufacturing (CAM).\n\nOpenSCAD is often used for creating models for rapid prototyping, 3D printing, and mechanical engineering. It runs on most operating systems including Linux, macOS, and Windows. Its main advantage is its ability to produce precise, accurate, and manufacturing-ready designs.

Use some example that can be understood by a high school student3", "longest_response": "Sure! I'd be happy to help you understand the concepts of prototype and delegate in Swift. Let's break it down with simple examples.\n\n1. Prototype: In Swift, a prototype is not a built-in concept. Instead, it refers to creating an instance of a custom class or struct as a starting point for duplicating and modifying new instances.\n\nFor example, let's create a CustomView class that has properties for a label and an image. We'll make a prototype instance and see how we can customize it.\n\n```swift\nclass CustomView: UIView {\n    var titleLabel: UILabel!\n    var imageView: UIImageView!\n\n    override init(frame: CGRect) {\n        super.init(frame: frame)\n        commonInit()\n    }\n\n    required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {\n        super.init(coder: aDecoder)\n        commonInit()\n    }\n\n    func commonInit() {\n        titleLabel = UILabel()\n        titleLabel.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false\n        titleLabel.text = \"Custom View\"\n        self.addSubview(titleLabel)\n\n        imageView = UIImageView()\n        imageView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false\n        imageView.image = UIImage(named: \"exampleImage\")\n        self.addSubview(imageView)\n\n        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([\n            titleLabel.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.centerXAnchor),\n            titleLabel.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.topAnchor, constant: 10),\n\n            imageView.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.centerXAnchor),\n            imageView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: titleLabel.bottomAnchor, constant: 10),\n            imageView.widthAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.widthAnchor, multiplier: 0.5),\n            imageView.heightAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.heightAnchor, multiplier: 0.5)\n        ])\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOnce you create CustomView in your storyboard, you can create an outlet and use code like this to reference the prototype instance, and then modify it as needed:\n\n```swift\nlet customView = storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"CustomView\") as! CustomView\ncustomView.titleLabel.text = \"New Title\"\n```\n\n2. Delegate: A delegate is a pattern in Swift that allows communication between classes. One class, called the delegate, will have a reference to an instance of another class, and it agrees to be notified and perform certain actions when specific events occur in the second class.\n\nFor example, let's create a `TableViewCell` with a button:\n\n```swift\nclass TableViewCell: UITableViewCell {\n    @IBOutlet weak var myButton: UIButton!\n    weak var delegate: TableViewCellDelegate?\n\n    @IBAction func buttonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {\n        delegate?.tableViewCellDidTap(_: self)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFirst, we set up an outlet for our button, and we declare a `TableViewCellDelegate` protocol, which defines a single method `tableViewCellDidTap(_:)`.\n\nIn the button's action, we call the `tableViewCellDidTap(_:)` method on our delegate, passing self as an argument.\n\nNext, let's look at our TableViewController, where we set ourselves as the delegate for our TableViewCell instances:\n\n```swift\nclass TableViewController: UITableViewController, TableViewCellDelegate {\n    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {\n        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: \"MyCell\", for: indexPath)\n        cell.delegate = self\n\n        // configure the cell here\n        return cell\n    }\n\n    func tableViewCellDidTap(_ cell: TableViewCell) {\n        print(\"Cell tapped!\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the `tableView(_:cellForRowAt:)` method, we set our TableViewController as the delegate for our TableViewCell instances, and then we can respond to button taps in the `tableViewCellDidTap(_:)` method.", "shortest_response": "Absolutely! Let's break down the concepts of prototypes and delegation in Swift using simple examples that a high school student can understand.\n\n1. **Prototype**: In object-oriented programming, a prototype is an initial model or template for a certain type. However, Swift doesn't have a prototype system like JavaScript or some other languages. Instead, Swift uses classes to create instances, which can be thought of as copies or prototypes of the class structure.\n\nHere's a simple example of aclass in Swift:\n\n```swift\nclass Car {\n    var brand: String\n    var model: String\n\n    init(brand: String, model: String) {\n        self.brand = brand\n        self.model = model\n    }\n\n    func drive() {\n        print(\"\\(brand) \\(model) is driving.\")\n    }\n}\n\nlet myCar = Car(brand: \"Tesla\", model: \"Model S\")\nmyCar.drive()  // Output: Tesla Model S is driving.\n```\n\nIn the above example, `Car` is like a prototype - it defines the structure and behavior that our car instances (like `myCar`) will have.\n\n2. **Delegation**: Delegation is a design pattern used in programming to separate the tasks of an object or class from another object or class. A delegate handles specific tasks or parts of a job when asked by the object that owns it.\n\nIn Swift, delegation is commonly used with protocols. Here's an example of how you might use delegation with a simple protocol:\n\n```swift\nprotocol MessageDelegate {\n    func displayMessage(message: String)\n}\n\nclass SMSSender {\n    var delegate: MessageDelegate?\n\n    func send(message: String) {\n        print(\"Sending SMS: \\(message)\")\n        delegate?.displayMessage(message: message)\n    }\n}\n\nclass User: MessageDelegate {\n    func displayMessage(message: String) {\n        print(\"Received message: \\(message)\")\n    }\n}\n\nlet user = User()\nlet smsSender = SMSSender()\nsmsSender.delegate = user\nsmsSender.send(message: \"Hello World!\")  // Output: Sending SMS: Hello World! Received message: Hello World!\n```\n\nIn this example, `SMSSender` doesn't know how to directly display the messages it sends, but it can ask its delegate (the `User` object in this case) to handle it for them. So the `SMSSender` delegates the task of displaying the message to the `User`.", "input_size": 30, "output_sizes": [1020, 886, 748, 962, 1034, 781, 655, 883, 750, 596], "output_mean": 831.5, "output_std": 142.12, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 748.5, "p50": 832.0, "p75": 943.0, "p99": 1032.74}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 26.09362}, {"sample_id": "701cc4d630e445d1", "prompt_id": "a2560e6792f2be83", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "why does whiskey needed copper distiller?", "longest_response": "Whiskey, particularly Scotch Whisky, is often distilled in copper stills because of the properties of copper. Copper helps in several ways:\n\n1. Catalysis: Copper accelerates certain chemical reactions, which is important in the distillation process. It helps turn alcohol into acids and esters, which add to the flavor profile of the whisky.\n\n2. Removal of Sulfides: Copper removes sulfur compounds from the distillate. Sulfur can add a nasty burnt flavor to the product. The more sulfur compounds that can be removed, the smoother and more palatable the whiskey will be.\n\n3. Corrosion Resistance: Unlike many other metals, copper is resistant to the corrosive effects of alcohol. However, it does react with acidic compounds, which can help in the distillation process as mentioned above.\n\n4. Heat Conductivity: Copper is an excellent heat conductor. This means the still can be heated efficiently and quickly, and the heat can be distributed evenly. This is important to ensure the distillation process is controlled and consistent.\n\nIn summary, copper distillers are used for whiskey distillation because they facilitate the chemical reactions that form the flavors, help remove sulfides for a smoother taste, are heat conductive, and resist corrosion. These properties combined help to produce the distinctive taste and quality associated with whiskey.", "shortest_response": "Whiskey needs copper distillation equipment because copper is effective at removing sulfur compounds, methanol, and other impurities during the distillation process. These impurities can negatively affect the taste, aroma, and overall quality of the whiskey. Copper's reactivity promotes this purification, as it allows these compounds to bond with the copper in a process known as redox reaction. Additionally, copper enhances the flavors of the whiskey by promoting the formation of desirable congeners like esters, which contribute to the whiskey's distinctive flavor profile.

This analysis will explore the disaster management cycle in Japan by investigating the challenges and opportunities in each phase: prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation/development.\n\nPrevention:\nOne of the challenges in prevention is the geographical composition of Japan, making it vulnerable to seismic and meteorological hazards. Japan addresses this challenge through stringent building codes and strict regulations for infrastructure (Murayama, 2016).\nHowever, the opportunity lies in continuous research and innovation, where cutting-edge technology is utilized to predict and mitigate disaster risks. For instance, Japan's earthquake early warning system is considered the most advanced in the world (Japan Meteorological Agency, 2021).\n\nPreparedness:\nThe challenge in preparing for disasters is effectively communicating disaster-related information to the public. Japanese cities have faced criticism for their inadequate evacuation plans and inconsistent emergency messaging (Kurita et al., 2015).\nThe opportunity is in adopting multi-channel communication methods that cater to all demographics effectively. Moreover, Japan's schools often lead preparedness training and drills, contributing to a disaster-resilient society (Ristow, 2019).\n\nResponse:\nResponding to disasters in densely populated areas like Japan can be challenging, as it requires rapid mobilization of resources and manpower. The response is often hampered by poor infrastructure access and the potential for secondary disasters caused by power outages and fires (Reed & Saito, 2018).\nYet, opportunities lie in advancing technology to monitor the situation more effectively, increasing the efficiency of evacuation, and improving infrastructure robustness to reduce disaster-related damages (Yokota et al., 2011).\n\nRecovery:\nRecovery challenges include restoring critical infrastructure, addressing social and psychological trauma, and rehabilitating affected communities (OCHA, 2020). The 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami revealed significant gaps in disaster recovery assistance and the need for a more comprehensive approach to aid (UNICEF, 2011).\nThe opportunity lies in leveraging advanced technological solutions to accelerate the recovery process, as well as exploring public-private partnerships to boost relief efforts. Furthermore, increasing financial resources dedicated to disaster recovery and strengthening community resilience are crucial (Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2016).\n\nMitigation/Development:\nMitigating and developing strategies involve creating more disaster-resilient communities and infrastructure. In Japan, challenges are evident in the fragmented approach between local and national governments, and insufficient funding for long-term resilience projects (FEMA, 2012).\nThe opportunity lies in fostering a greater collaboration between the public and private sectors, improving communication between different levels of government, and increasing investment in sustainable infrastructure and community-based projects. Additionally, Japan should capitalize on its rich historical and cultural knowledge when designing resilient communities (Kishida et al., 2009).\n\nConclusion:\nThe disaster management cycle in Japan faces challenges specific to its geographical and societal context. Improving the response, recovery, and prevention through technological advancements, multi-channel communication, and greater collaboration between the public and private sectors is essential. By focusing on these opportunities, Japan can become a global leader in disaster risk management and resilience.\n\nReferences:\nFEMA (2012). International Cooperation and Lessons Learned.

Preparedness: The Philippines has made significant efforts in building a culture of disaster preparedness. The National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (NDRRMC) is the main body responsible for disaster preparedness. However, challenges persist due to the country's geographical size, with vast rural areas lacking sufficient resources and infrastructure for effective preparedness. Data from the World Risk Report 2020 places the Philippines as the 4th most at-risk country in Asia. Opportunities include enhancing community-based disaster preparedness programs and increasing investment in early warning systems, particularly in disaster-prone areas.\n\n2. Prevention: Prevention efforts focus on land use planning, building codes, and environmental protection measures. For instance, the passage of the Climate Change Act in 2009 mandates greenhouse gas emissions reduction and climate change adaptation. However, challenges include weak enforcement of regulations and corruption, as reported by Global Witness. Opportunities lie in strengthening governance and accountability in prevention measures to ensure their effective implementation.\n\n3. Mitigation: The Philippines engages in various mitigation strategies, such as infrastructure projects like flood control systems and hazard maps to support risk-informed development. However, challenges include inadequate funding for disaster risk reduction initiatives and insufficient public awareness about mitigation measures. Opportunities include tapping into international funding sources and promoting public-private partnerships for mitigation projects.\n\n4. Response: The Philippine National Police and Armed Forces of the Philippines play crucial roles in disaster response, but challenges include inadequate resources and capacity, particularly in rural areas. Response times can be slow, as seen during Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, where the government was criticized for its delayed response. Opportunities lie in improving response capacity through increased resources, training, and partnerships with civil society organizations and the private sector.\n\n5. Recovery: Recovery efforts focus on rebuilding infrastructure and providing assistance to affected communities. However, challenges include insufficient funds, corruption, and the recurrence of disasters before full recovery. For instance, the Philippines still struggles with rebuilding after Typhoon Haiyan 8 years later. Opportunities include disaster-resilient infrastructure design and policies that promote social inclusion and economic development to prevent future shocks.\n\n6. Development: Disaster risk reduction should be integrated into development planning to create a disaster-resilient society. The Philippines has initiatives like the Disaster Resilience for Development program but faces challenges in balancing development goals with disaster risk reduction. Opportunities include enhancing the mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction into policies, plans, and programs at all levels of government.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Philippines has made progress in disaster management, various challenges persist across all phases of the cycle. Opportunities lie in strengthening governance, increasing investments, and integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning. Collaboration between government, civil society, and the private sector is essential to addressing these challenges and building a more resilient Philippines.", "input_size": 222, "output_sizes": [776, 918, 1003, 890, 935, 704, 864, 1455, 877, 764], "output_mean": 918.6, "output_std": 197.72, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 798.0, "p50": 883.5, "p75": 930.75, "p99": 1414.32}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 44.04732}, {"sample_id": "5955b028e07f9a5d", "prompt_id": "d4cd216ea21e6d48", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Write an XAML page for me, where the page serves as a stopwatch.", "longest_response": "I will provide a basic XAML structure for a Stopwatch page in a UWP app using C# and XAML.

The `P` space stands for polynomial, and in this case, we use a space of degree 1 for the solution.\n\nYou can modify the right-hand side `f` to reflect your specific problem, and also adjust the mesh size to get more or less refined results.", "input_size": 12, "output_sizes": [610, 376, 398, 329, 310, 523, 330, 375, 434, 402], "output_mean": 408.7, "output_std": 88.81, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 341.25, "p50": 387.0, "p75": 426.0, "p99": 602.17}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 13.7172}, {"sample_id": "97715374e04c896c", "prompt_id": "a9c3e2d9588bcc92", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "what other distributions are supported?", "longest_response": "In the context of machine learning and statistical analysis, there are numerous probability distributions that are widely used besides the normal distribution (Gaussian). Here are some of the most common ones:\n\n1. **Bernoulli Distribution:** This distribution describes the probability of a binary event (success or failure). The most common example is the toss of a coin where 1 represents a head and 0 represents a tail.\n\n2. **Binomial Distribution:** This distribution gives the probabilities of a certain number of successes in a fixed number of independent and identical Bernoulli trials (like tossing a coin multiple times).\n\n3. **Poisson Distribution:** Poisson distribution is used to describe the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space. For example, the number of emails received in an hour or the number of cars passing through a intersection per minute.\n\n4. **Exponential Distribution:** The exponential distribution describes the time between events that occur consistently at a known rate. It is often used in survival analysis and reliability.\n\n5. **Uniform Distribution:** This is a continuous probability distribution where all values in a certain range have an equal probability. A common example is the random generation of a number between 0 and 1.\n\n6. **Gamma Distribution:** The gamma distribution is the continuous analogue of the chi-squared distribution. It is the distribution of sums of squares of independent standard normalrandom variables.\n\n7. **Weibull Distribution:** This distribution is used for representing the failure time of items; it is used to describe the lifetime of components, machine parts, structures, etc.\n\n8. **Cauchy Distribution:** This distribution is also known as the Lorentz distribution. It is a continuous probability distribution characterized by its highly asymmetrical, bell-shaped curve with a peak located at the origins of the real line.\n\n9. **Chi-Square Distribution:** This distribution describes the sum of squares of Standard Normal variables. It is commonly used in statistical hypothesis testing, and for describing variance or covariance.\n\n10. **F Distribution:** The F distribution is the ratio of two chi-squared variates, each divided by their degrees of freedom, and is therefore also a quotient of two independent chi-square random variables, each divided by their degrees of freedom.\n\nMany more distributions exist, but these are some of the commonly encountered ones in machine learning and statistics.

Introduction\n\nA Chrome extension is a type of software component that adds a specific feature to the Chrome browser. In this guide, we will be creating an extension that interacts with Google APIs to demonstrate its functionality. This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\n<a name=\"project-overview-and-functionality\"></a>\n## 2. Project Overview and Functionality\n\nFor this project, we will create a Chrome extension that allows users to search for images using a provided keyword and display the results within the browser. We will also provide options for users to customize the behavior of the extension.\n\n<a name=\"preparation\"></a>\n## 3. Preparation\n\n<a name=\"setting-up-your-development-environment\"></a>\n### 3.1 Setting up your development environment\n\nBefore we start building our extension, ensure you have the following tools installed:\n\n- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/): The browser in which we will be testing our extension.\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): A JavaScript runtime that will help us manage our project and automate tasks.\n- [Chrome Extension Developer Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jhe.vscode-chrome-extension): A set of tools for Visual Studio Code that simplifies the development of Chrome extensions.\n\nOnce you have these tools installed, you can start setting up your project.\n\n<a name=\"creating-a-new-chrome-extension-project\"></a>\n### 3.2 Creating a new Chrome Extension project\n\n1. Open Visual Studio Code and create a new folder for your project.\n2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder.\n3. Run `yo chrome-extension` to create a new Chrome extension project. If you don't have `yo` installed, you'll need to install it first by running `npm install -g yo`.\n4. Answer the prompts as follows:\n    - Name of your extension: `ImageSearch`\n    - Chrome version for the manifest file: Enter the latest major version number (e.g. 97)\n    - Add a popup: `yes`\n    - Add an options page: `yes`\n    - Add content scripts: `yes`\n\nDuring this process, yo will create the required structure for your project, including the `manifest.json`, `popup`, `options`, and `content_scripts` folders.\n\n<a name=\"manifest-file\"></a>\n## 4. Manifest File\n\nThe `manifest.json` file is the central configuration file for your extension, enabling it to communicate with the Chrome browser and define its permissions, content scripts, and other settings.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"manifest_version\": 3,\n  \"name\": \"Image Search\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"action\": {\n    \"default_popup\": \"popup/popup.html\",\n    \"default_icon\": {\n      \"16\": \"icons/icon16.png\",\n      \"48\": \"icons/icon48.png\",\n      \"128\": \"icons/icon128.png\"\n    },\n    \"default_title\": \"Image Search\"\n  },\n  \"permissions\": [\"activeTab\", \"https://www.googleapis.com/*\"],\n  \"background\": {\n    \"service_worker\": \"background/service-worker.js\"\n  },\n  \"content_scripts\": [\n    {\n      \"matches\": [\"*://*/*\"],\n      \"js\": [\"content_scripts/content-script.js\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"options_page\": \"options/options.html\",\n  \"browser_action\": {\n    \"default_icon\": {\n      \"16\": \"icons/icon16.png\",\n      \"48\": \"icons/icon48.png\",\n      \"128\": \"icons/icon128.png\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- The `manifest_version` defines the version of the manifest file structure.\n- `name`, `version`, and `description` provide basic information about your extension.\n- The `action` section defines the default behavior when users click the extension's icon, such as opening the popup.\n- The `permissions` array lists the extensions' required permissions, in this case, access to the active tab and Google APIs.\n- The `background` section specifies the service worker responsible for handling background tasks.\n- The `content_scripts` array declares a content script that will be injected into all pages.\n- The `options_page` specifies the HTML file for the options page.\n- The `browser_action` section defines the default icons for the extension.\n\n<a name=\"service-worker-optional\"></a>\n## 5. Service Worker (Optional)\n\nA Service Worker is a JavaScript file that helps manage your extension's background tasks, such as handling network requests, caching resources, and notifying the popup of events. It can operate even when the browser is not active.\n\nIn our example, we'll create a simple Service Worker that listens for a message from the content script and initiates a search using Google's Image Search API.\n\nCreate a new file called `background/service-worker.js` and paste the following code:\n\n```javascript\nself.onMessageExternal = function(request, sender, sendResponse) {\n  // Check if the request contains the correct event and keyword\n  if (request.event === 'image-search' && request.keyword) {\n    // Fetch images using Google Image Search API\n    fetch('https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1', {\n      method: 'GET',\n      headers: {\n        'Authorization': `Google ${chrome.runtime.getManifest().apiKey}`,\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n      },\n      body: JSON.stringify({\n        key: chrome.runtime.getManifest().apiKey,\n        cx: 'YOUR_CX_ID', // Replace with your Custom Search Engine ID\n        q: request.keyword,\n        searchType: 'image'\n      })\n    })\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(data => {\n        // Send the search results to the popup\n        chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ event: 'image-search-results', data });\n      })\n      .catch(error => {\n        console.error(error);\n      });\n  }\n};\n```\n\nReplace `YOUR_CX_ID` with your Custom Search Engine ID, which you can obtain from [Google's Custom Search Engine API console](https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=customsearch&hl=en).\n\n<a name=\"content-script\"></a>\n## 6. Content Script\n\nContent scripts execute within the context of the web page they're injected into, allowing them to interact with DOM elements and manipulate the page's content. In our case, we'll create a content script that adds a button to web pages, allowing users to initiate an image search.\n\nCreate a new file called `content_scripts/content-script.js` and paste the following code:\n\n```javascript\nconst searchButton = document.createElement('button');\nsearchButton.textContent = 'Search Images';\nsearchButton.addEventListener('click', () => {\n  const keywordInput = document.createElement('input');\n  keywordInput.type = 'text';\n  keywordInput.value = '';\n\n  const searchForm = document.createElement('form');\n  searchForm.appendChild(keywordInput);\n  searchForm.appendChild(searchButton);\n\n  keywordInput.addEventListener('submit', event => {\n    event.preventDefault();\n\n    const keyword = keywordInput.value;\n\n    // Send a message to the service worker to initiate the search\n    chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ event: 'image-search', keyword });\n  });\n\n  document.body.appendChild(searchForm);\n});\n\ndocument.body.appendChild(searchButton);\n```\n\n<a name=\"popup\"></a>\n## 7. Popup\n\nThe popup is the window that appears when users click on the extension's icon. This is where we'll display the search results.\n\nCreate a new file called `popup/popup.html` and paste the following code:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>Image Search</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <h1>Image Search Results</h1>\n  <div id=\"search-results\"></div>\n\n  <script src=\"popup.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nCreate another file called `popup/popup.js` and paste the following code:\n\n```javascript\n// Receive messages from the service worker and update the search results container\nchrome.runtime.onMessageExternal.addListener(function(request, sender, sendResponse) {\n  if (request.event === 'image-search-results') {\n    const searchResults = document.getElementById('search-results');\n    request.data.items.forEach(item => {\n      const result = document.createElement('a');\n      result.href = item.link;\n      result.target = '_blank';\n      result.textContent = item.title;\n\n      const img = document.createElement('img');\n      img.src = item.image.thumbnailLink;\n      img.alt = item.title;\n      result.appendChild(img);\n\n      searchResults.appendChild(result);\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n<a name=\"options-page\"></a>\n## 8. Options Page\n\nThe options page provides users with settings to customize the extension.\n\nCreate a new file called `options/options.html` and paste the following code:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>Image Search Options</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <h1>Image Search Options</h1>\n  <!-- Add options fields and listener code here -->\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nYou can customize this page to add form fields and event listeners as needed.\n\n<a name=\"icons\"></a>\n## 9. Icons\n\nIcons are used to represent the extension in various places, such as the extension's icon, the popup, and the options page. Make sure to create 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel icons and place them in the `icons` folder created during project setup.\n\n<a name=\"google-api-integration\"></a>\n## 10. Google API Integration\n\nAs mentioned earlier, we'll use the Google Custom Search Engine API to fetch images for our extension. You can find the documentation and API references [here](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/getting_started).\n\n<a name=\"testing\"></a>\n## 11. Testing\n\nTo test your extension, load the unpacked extension in Chrome:\n\n1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.\n2. Enable Developer mode by toggling the switch in the top right corner.\n3. Click \"Load unpacked\" and select your project folder.\n\nYour extension should now be loaded, and you can test it on any webpage.\n\n<a name=\"packaging-and-distribution\"></a>\n## 12. Packaging and Distribution\n\nOnce you're satisfied with your extension, you can package it for distribution. You can find the official guide on packaging extensions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/package/).\n\n<a name=\"additional-resources\"></a>\n## 13. Additional Resources\n\n- [Official Chrome Extensions documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/)\n- [Google Custom Search Engine API documentation](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview)\n\n<a name=\"conclusion\"></a>\n## 14. Conclusion\n\nCongratulations! You've now created a fully functional Chrome extension. Building extensions provides a valuable opportunity to dive deeper into web development, APIs, and user interface design. Keep exploring, and remember to continually refine and add features to your projects. Happy coding!", "shortest_response": "Title: Building a Chrome Extension: A Comprehensive Guide for Computer Science Students\n\n## Introduction\n\nWelcome to this comprehensive guide on building a Chrome Extension! This tutorial is designed to walk you through the process of developing a robust and feature-rich Chrome extension from scratch. By the end of this guide, you will have a solid understanding of the architecture, code, and APIs involved in creating a Chrome extension.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will build a simple \"Bookmark Manager\" extension. This extension will allow users to manage their bookmarks, add new bookmarks, delete existing ones, and organize them into folders.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n- Familiarity with the Chrome extension architecture\n- A text editor for writing and editing code (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)\n- Google Chrome browser (for testing and development)\n\n## Project Structure\n\nHere's a brief overview of the project structure for our \"Bookmark Manager\" extension:\n\n- `manifest.json`: The manifest file that provides essential metadata about the extension.\n- `images`: Contains the icons for the extension.\n- `popup`: Folder for the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files related to the popup UI.\n- `options`: Folder for the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files related to the extension's options page.\n- `background`: Folder for the JavaScript (service worker) that runs in the background.\n- `content_scripts`: Folder for JavaScript files to be injected into web pages.\n\n## Manifest.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"manifest_version\": 3,\n  \"name\": \"Bookmark Manager\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"action\": {\n    \"default_popup\": \"popup/index.html\",\n    \"default_title\": \"Bookmark Manager\"\n  },\n  \"permissions\": [\n    \"bookmarks\",\n    \"<all_urls>\"\n  ],\n  \"icons\": {\n    \"48\": \"images/icon48.png\",\n    \"128\": \"images/icon128.png\"\n  },\n  \"background\": {\n    \"service_worker\": \"background/service-worker.js\"\n  },\n  \"options_ui\": {\n    \"page\": \"options/index.html\",\n    \"open_in_tab\": true\n  },\n  \"content_scripts\": [\n    {\n      \"matches\": [\"https://*/*\", \"http://*/*\"],\n      \"js\": [\"content_scripts/content.js\"],\n      \"run_at\": \"document_end\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `manifest_version`: Specifies the manifest file format version.\n- `name`: The name of the extension.\n- `version`: The version number of the extension.\n- `action`: Defines the default popup and its title.\n- `permissions`: Provides access to the required APIs (bookmarks and all URLs for our extension).\n- `icons`: Sets up icons for the extension at different sizes.\n- `background`: Specifies the service worker responsible for handling background tasks.\n- `options_ui`: Sets up the options page for the extension.\n- `content_scripts`: Injects content scripts into specific web pages.\n\n## Background Script (Service Worker)\n\n### service-worker.js\n\n```javascript\n// Listen for messages from the content script\nchrome.runtime.onMessageReceived.addListener((request, sender, sendResponse) => {\n  if (request.action === \"saveBookmark\") {\n    // Save the bookmark using the `chrome.bookmarks` API\n    chrome.bookmarks.create(request.bookmarkData, (bookmarkId) => {\n      if (bookmarkId) {\n        // Send a response to the content script to confirm the bookmark was saved\n        sendResponse({ success: true, bookmarkId });\n      } else {\n        sendResponse({ success: false });\n      }\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Listens for messages from the content script (`content.js`).\n- When a message with `action: \"saveBookmark\"` is received, it uses the `chrome.bookmarks.create` API to save the provided bookmark data.\n\n## Content Script\n\n### content.js\n\n```javascript\n// Listen for the 'click' event on the 'Save Bookmark' button and send amessage to the background script\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {\n  const saveBookmarkButton = document.querySelector('#save-bookmark-button');\n  if (saveBookmarkButton) {\n    saveBookmarkButton.addEventListener('click', () => {\n      const bookmarkData = {\n        title: document.querySelector('#bookmark-title-input').value,\n        url: document.querySelector('#bookmark-url-input').value,\n        parentId: document.querySelector('#folder-select').value\n      };\n      chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: \"saveBookmark\", bookmarkData });\n      // Clear the input fields\n      document.querySelector('#bookmark-title-input').value = '';\n      document.querySelector('#bookmark-url-input').value = '';\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Listens for the `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure the entire document has loaded.\n- Finds the Save Bookmark button and listens for the 'click' event.\n- When the button is clicked, it creates a bookmark object, sends a message to the background script with the bookmark data, and clears the input fields.\n\n## Popup and Options Pages UI\n\nCreate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the popup and options pages in their respective folders (popup/ and options/). You can find multiple examples and templates online to help you create the UI for these pages depending on your extension's requirements.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou have now built a basic \"Bookmark Manager\" Chrome extension! With this foundation, you can dive deeper into more complex features and APIs to create even more powerful extensions.\n\n## Further Resources\n\n- [Official Chrome Extension Developer Guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/)\n- [Chrome Extensions API Reference](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/api-index/)\n- [Bookmarks API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/bookmarks/)\n- [Message Passing Guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/messaging/)", "input_size": 216, "output_sizes": [2171, 2235, 1863, 1712, 3328, 1538, 1917, 2844, 1642, 2668], "output_mean": 2191.8, "output_std": 555.78, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 1749.75, "p50": 2044.0, "p75": 2559.75, "p99": 3284.44}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 140.17181}, {"sample_id": "7a8db8ffcfdb3946", "prompt_id": "19750e93e9fcaebf", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "\"3.0 The Three Cardinal Dimensions\nThe \u2018Looped Filter Theory,\u2019 coined by Richard Sitzgen of the 3rd TOR generation states that \u201cComponents of this universe are layered like a ring of coloured filters, all having a varying impact on each beneath it. They cannot be flipped, and to be flipped would be cataclysm.\u201d This coincides with observations made by TORFMA studies, throughout history, demonstrating that there are realms that mankind cannot always interact with. \n\nThe \u2018Door, Lock, Key and Room\u2019 theory created by the Elven Auristas magic practitioner Gus Philippe frames the three dimensions as such. The Corporworld is the body of the lock, meanwhile the essence of a creature (section 3.0) acts as the key to the door, the Manaworld. However, on top of it all, is the space behind the door, the Duinnworld. This section will briefly discuss each realm in order of least-impact to most impact, and its effects on its subsidiaries.\n\n3.1 Corporworld\nThe least impactful, but most important of the four cardinal dimensions is the Corporworld, or the \u2018tangible dimension.\u2019 This is the dimension in which you, the reader, are currently in. Not only does it act as a bridge between the Manaworld and Duinnworld, it acts as a residence for any creature within the realms. It is proven that life is stunted in creatures with a lessened connection to the Manaworld, hence why mages experience fatigue after long spell-casting sessions. The other realms facilitate the act, whereas the Corporworld is where it all happens.\n3.2 Manaworld\nThe second least impactful but most observed outside of course, the Corporworld, is the Manaworld. Throughout history on various Hubworlds, similarities have been drawn between this dimension and \u2018the afterlife \u2019 in most cultures, but regardless, religious debate is not the purpose of this report. The Manaworld is the resource that facilitates spell-casting, and can be adversely affected by uses of it in the corporworld. A common phenomenon witnessed in locations of mass spell-casting, loss of life or battle is \u2018manaworld deviation,\u2019 where a concavity or simply put, dent, is made in the fabric of the dimension, permitting the welling of Mana particles. If it is a concavity causing increase in density of mana particles, it is known as a \u2018positive manaworld deviation (PMD), and if a convexity is caused making mana particles leave the area, it is a \u2018negative manaworld deviation\u2019 (NMD).\n\n3.2.1 Manaworld Functions, and Mana-Tides\nMethods of entering the Manaworld have been manufactured, but are highly discouraged as the typical essence is incapable of withstanding \u2018Mana-Tides.\u2019 Examples of types of magic that do not simply pull mana particles from the Manaworld, but utilize the very dimension\u2019s functions, include on a basic level, mana-sensory magic, and on a complex level, time magic. While the former poses little risk to the user due to simply linking the senses to the dimension, the latter is significantly discouraged due to the risks on the user.\n\nMana-Tides are a natural phenomenon in the Manaworld that rejuvenate particles roughly every 48 hours. They act as a large brush, or riptide, hence the name, where any particle or essence too weak to withstand it is swept into a sub-layer of the dimension known as the Manaworld Void, from which it is incredibly difficult to return, especially without permanent repercussions to the essence. The Void is unexplored, and undocumented.\n3.3 Duinnworld\nThe most impactful of the three dimensions is the Duinnworld, affecting the Manaworld and consequently the Corporworld. Due to only previous prodigies being able to enter the Duinnworld, the characteristics of this dimension are fairly unknown. It is observed that while duinn functions similarly to magic, it is an entirely independent force that simply has the capability of manipulating mana. Based on information from many generations ago, the Duinnworld is a much more stable, time dilated dimension that actually facilitates the growth of magic aptitude. It can also be assumed that much like Duinn itself, the duinnworld reacts to emotion and has some sort of conscience.\"", "longest_response": "Title: Understanding the Three Cardinal Dimensions of the TOR Universe\n\nBody:\n\nThis article aims to provide an overview of the three cardinal dimensions in the TOR universe - the Corporworld, Manaworld, and Duinnworld - as proposed by various theories and studies.\n\n3.1 Corporworld: Often referred to as the 'tangible dimension,' the Corporworld is the realm we, as readers, inhabit. It serves as a bridge connecting the Manaworld and Duinnworld, and is the place where life occurs. Creatures with a reduced connection to the Manaworld experience stunted life, such as mages who experience fatigue after prolonged spell-casting sessions.\n\n3.2 Manaworld: The Manaworld is the dimension responsible for facilitating spell-casting. Throughout history and across various Hubworlds, it has been observed to bear similarities to the afterlife in many cultures. The Manaworld can be affected adversely by the use of magic in the Corporworld, leading to phenomena such as 'manaworld deviation.' This deviation can cause either a 'positive manaworld deviation (PMD),' where a concavity or dent is made in the dimension, increasing the density of mana particles, or a 'negative manaworld deviation' (NMD), where a convexity is formed, causing mana particles to leave the area.\n\n3.2.1 Manaworld Functions and Mana-Tides: While methods to enter the Manaworld have been developed, they are generally discouraged due to the risks associated with 'Mana-Tides.' These natural phenomena rejuvenate mana particles approximately every 48 hours, acting like a large brush or riptide. Any particle or essence too weak to withstand the Mana-Tide is swept into the sub-layer of the dimension known as the Manaworld Void, from which it is extremely difficult to return without significant repercussions to the essence.\n\n3.3 Duinnworld: The most impactful of the three dimensions, the Duinnworld affects both the Manaworld and, consequently, the Corporworld. While only prodigies have been able to enter the Duinnworld, it is observed that duinn functions similarly to magic but operates independently, with the capacity to manipulate mana. It appears to be a much more stable, time-dilated dimension that contributes to the growth of magic aptitude. Like Duinn itself, the Duinnworld seems to react to emotion and may possess some form of consciousness.\n\nIn conclusion, these three dimensions - the Corporworld, Manaworld, and Duinnworld - form the foundation of the TOR universe, each playing a unique role in shaping the experiences and abilities of its inhabitants. As understanding of these dimensions grows, so too will the potential for exploration, discovery, and mastery of their interconnected properties.", "shortest_response": "This text describes the Looped Filter Theory and the Door, Lock, Key, and Room theory, two theories about the structures and workings of the universe in a fictional world.

Functions, on the other hand, do not have access to such data unless it is explicitly passed in as an argument or returned as a result.

Using it could lead to security risks and compatibility issues.\n\n1. **Install Homebrew**: If you haven't installed Homebrew yet, you can do so by running the following command in the terminal:\n\n```bash\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n```\n\n2. **Update Homebrew**: Once Homebrew is installed, you should update it to the latest version by running:\n\n```bash\nbrew update\n```\n\n3. **Install Python 2 using Homebrew**: Homebrew doesn't provide precompiled Python 2 packages because it's no longer recommended to use it. Instead, we'll use a third-party formula:\n\n```bash\nbrew install python@2\n```\n\nThis command will install Python 2.7. If you need a specific version, replace `2.7` with your desired version (e.g., `2.7.15`, `2.7.10`, etc.).\n\n4. **Install the MacVim package**: To make it easier to use Python, we'll also install the MacVim package for Python integration:\n\n```bash\nbrew install vim\n```\n\n5. **Setup Python2 environment**: To make Python2 accessible from everywhere, you'll need to add it to the system PATH. If you wish to have separate Python2 environment, use virtualenv:\n\n```bash\npip install virtualenv\n```\n\nCreate and activate a separate virtual environment for Python2:\n\n```bash\nvirtualenv --python=/usr/local/bin/python2.7 my_project_env\nsource my_project_env/bin/activate\n```\n\nNow Python2 is active in your environment.\n\n6. **Test the installation**: To ensure Python2 is working correctly, you can run the following command:\n\n```bash\npython -V\n```\n\nIt should print the installed Python version (e.g., `Python 2.7.15`).\n\nRemember, using Python 2 could lead to security risks and compatibility issues. It's recommended to use Python 3 wherever possible. If you need to work with Python 2 only for a specific project, consider creating a virtual environment as described in step 5 above.\n\nLastly, this installation method has been tested with macOS Big Sur, but it should work on other macOS versions as well.

Update Homebrew:\n   ```\n   brew upgrade homebrew\n   ```\n   This ensures you have the latest version of Homebrew.\n\n3. Tap the Python 2 formula and install it:\n   ```\n   brew tap homebrew/versions\n   brew install python@2\n   ```\n\n4. Install dependencies needed for some optional modules:\n   ```\n   brew install readline sqlite3 gcc\n   ```\n\n5. Link the installed Python 2 binary for system-wide use:\n   ```\n   ln -s $(which python@2) /usr/local/bin/python2\n   ```\n\n6.

In your current setup, FreeRADIUS first tries the LDAP authentication and then, in the `post-auth` block, it checks the result and if it's OK, it triggers the BSA MFA. However, it seems that FreeRADIUS moves forward with the next stages (e.g., accounting) before BSA completes its verification.\n\nTo address this issue, you could modify your FreeRADIUS configuration to properly sequence the `Auth-Type` directives. Instead of placing the BSA `Auth-Type` directive in the `post-auth` block, you should place both `Auth-Type` directives (LDAP and BSA) within the `authenticate` block and handle the \"OK\" and \"FAIL\" cases for both authentications.\n\nHere is a restructured version of your configuration file:\n\n```\nauthenticate {\n    LDAP {\n        ldap\n        server = \"ldap.example.com\"\n        bind_user = \"ldap_user\"\n        bind_pass = \"ldap_password\"\n        base = \"dc=dev-ldap,dc=fnsmalaysia,dc=com\"\n        search_filter = \"(sAMAccountName=%{User-Name})\"\n        attribute = \"sAMAccountName\"\n\n        if (ok) {\n            bsa {\n                if (ok) {\n                    # Continue with authentication processing\n                } else {\n                    # Handle MFA fail or other cases\n                }\n            }\n        } else {\n            # Handle LDAP fail or other cases\n        }\n    }\n\n    BSA {\n        bsa\n    }\n\n    # If no authentications succeed, reject the request\n    reject\n}\n```\n\nThis configuration attempts LDAP and BSA authentications concurrently. If both authentications are successful, it proceeds with further processing. If either authentication fails, it handles the failure accordingly.\n\nIt's essential to ensure that your BSA module can handle asynchronous requests and properly communicate the results of the MFA to FreeRADIUS before proceeding with the next stages.\n\nPlease replace the LDAP server, bind_user, bind_pass, base, search_filter, and attribute placeholders with your actual credentials and configuration values. Adjust the MFA-specific code within the `ok` blocks (both for LDAP and BSA) as per your requirements.\n\nAfter making these changes, test the configuration and ensure that the MFA is executed before the authentication is approved.", "shortest_response": "It seems that the issue you're encountering is related to the order of the authentication modules in the FreeRADIUS configuration files. By default, FreeRADIUS evaluates modules in the order they are listed. In your case, LDAP authentication is evaluated before MFA (BSA) authentication, which could result in the MFA step being skipped.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should move the LDAP authentication module after the MFA (BSA) authentication module in your configuration file, specifically in the authenticate block. Here's an example of what your updated configuration should look like:\n\n```\n/etc/freeradius/3.0/sites-available/default\n\n...\nauth {\n    BSA\n    LDAP\n}\n...\n```\n\nIn the post-auth block, you should keep the if/else logic to handle the LDAP and BSA responses as you have already implemented.\n\nAfter making this change, restart the FreeRADIUS and OpenLDAP services to ensure that the configuration updates take effect.\n\n```\nsudo systemctl restart freeradius\nsudo systemctl restart slapd\n```\n\nNow, the authentication should wait for MFA (BSA) to complete before making a decision on whether to approve or reject the user's login attempt.", "input_size": 863, "output_sizes": [648, 574, 470, 469, 447, 390, 529, 513, 295, 654], "output_mean": 498.9, "output_std": 105.3, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 452.5, "p50": 491.5, "p75": 562.75, "p99": 653.46}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 22.08124}, {"sample_id": "7d8890e33bbca6ef", "prompt_id": "fc7c20a57d688175", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Is there anything in scientific literature about active learning in supervised settings?", "longest_response": "Yes, there is a substantial amount of scientific literature on active learning in supervised settings. Active learning is a machine learning (ML) technique where an algorithm is able to interactively query the user or an oracle to obtain the desired information to improve its learning performance.\n\nIn the context of supervised learning, active learning aims to efficiently choose the most informative examples from the unlabeled dataset to be labeled. By selecting these examples, the ML model can minimize the number of labels required to achieve a desirable level of accuracy.\n\nSome popular research topics in active learning include:\n\n1. Query strategies: There are various query strategies to decide which samples are the most informative for labeling. These strategies can be based on marginal uncertainty, uncertainty sampling, diversity sampling, and expected model change.\n\n2. Active learning with deep learning: Active learning for deep neural networks is gaining popularity due to their strong performance in various tasks. Researchers focus on developing specialized active learning strategies that are compatible with deep learning algorithms.\n\n3. Active learning in few-shot learning: Few-shot learning is a technique where a model learns to recognize new classes quickly from only a few examples. The task of active learning in few-shot learning focuses on improving the generalizability of the model with minimal labeled data.\n\n4. Active learning in imbalanced and semi-supervised settings: Active learning can be applied to imbalanced data as well as in semi-supervised settings, where only a small portion of the data is labeled, together with a larger unlabeled dataset.\n\n5. Adaptive active learning: This approach takes into account the current state of the model and adjusts the active learning strategy accordingly to better exploit the learning progress.\n\n6. Active learning transfer learning: In transfer learning, a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a new dataset. This idea can be extended to active learning, where the most informative examples are chosen for fine-tuning the model rather than the entire dataset.\n\nSome popular works and papers related to active learning in supervised settings include:\n\n1.

Active learning is a special case of machine learning where a learning algorithm can actively select instances (examples, data points) for labeling from a larger set of unlabeled data points, instead of passively receiving labeled examples one by one.\n\nThe primary goal of active learning is to improve the learning process by focusing the effort of labeling on the most informative or uncertain examples. This can lead to reduced labeling costs, faster convergence, and better final model performance.\n\nKey methods and ideas in active learning research include uncertainty sampling, query-by-committee, query-by-maximum-confidence, marginality sampling, and expected model change (EMC). These techniques attempt to balance the exploration-exploitation dilemma by ensuring that the learning algorithm efficiently discovers the boundaries of the learning problem while still refining its current understanding.\n\nSome prominent conferences and journals in the field of active learning include the Association for Computing Machinery's Conference on Learning and Knowledge Discovery (ACL), the Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), and the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS).\n\nA seminal book that provides a comprehensive treatment of active learning is \"Active Learning for Text Classification and Categorization: Theories, Algorithms, and Applications\" by Robert M.

She was known as Mother Nature, not because she had a penchant for wearing leaves or talking to animals, but because she could make even the most dormant solar panels produce electricity like a champ.\n\nOne day, a mysterious message arrived in Ren\u00e9e's lab. It was from John, who had accidentally discovered a substance that could reverse climate change but needed Ren\u00e9e's expertise to harness its power. The catch? The substance was in Norway, and time was running out.\n\nRen\u00e9e, armed with her PhD thesis, a backpack full of language books, and a French baguette for luck, ventured to Norway. Upon arrival, she was greeted by John, who seemed more excited about the baguette than her arrival. \"Ah, the famous French bread! I heard it's the secret to your solar energy knowledge,\" John quipped.\n\nThey set off on a thrilling adventure across the icy landscapes, dodging snowmen, solving solar puzzles, and learning each other's languages through humorous miscommunications. John, who had never known a world without solar energy, was amazed by Ren\u00e9e's abilities. \"It's like you're harnessing the sun's power with just a glance!\" he exclaimed.\n\nMeanwhile, a villainous corporation, known as the Fossil Fuels, had learned about the substance and sought to exploit it for their own nefarious purposes. They sent their agent, Iceman, to capture John and Ren\u00e9e.\n\nIn a heated showdown, John, using his medical expertise, neutralized Iceman by giving him an overdose of a vitamin concoction, making him so cheerful that he couldn't harm a fly. The Fossil Fuels, realizing their plan had backfired, retreated, vowing to find another way to increase their profits.\n\nJohn and Ren\u00e9e continued their adventure, eventually perfecting the substance. They named it 'Solareco', a tribute to their combined knowledge. With the power of Solareco, they set off to fix the planet, one solar panel at a time.\n\nAnd so, Dr. John and Dr. Ren\u00e9e, with their love for each other, their shared passion for solar energy, and their endless supply of humor, began their lifelong mission to make the world a greener, cleaner place.

Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Determine the Harmonized System (HS) code for your product: The HS code is an internationally standardized system used to classify products for customs purposes. You can find the HS code for your product on the Harmonized System Explanatory Notes (HSEN) published by the World Customs Organization (WCO), or you can use a tool like HS-Code Finder from the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC).\n\n2. Check the U.S. tariff schedule: Once you have the HS code for your product, you can find the applicable tariff rate in the U.S. tariff schedule, also known as the HTS (Harmonized Tariff Schedule). The tariff rate is usually expressed as a percentage of the product's value.\n\n3. Calculate the custom value of the product: Customs duty is based on the customs value of the product, defined as the invoice value or the actual transaction value, whichever is the lowest. Add transportation costs, insurance, and any other charges directly related to the purchase of the goods to the invoice value or transaction value to calculate the customs value.\n\n4. Determine if duty is assessed on the total value or the value after deducting duty: Some products have a specific U.S. note or a General Note that specifies whether duty is assessed on the total value or the value after deducting duty (called \"ad valorem\" or \"specific plus ad valorem,\" respectively). If a specific note applies to your product, follow the instructions provided.\n\n5. Calculate the customs duty: Multiply the customs value by the applicable tariff rate to get the duty amount.\n\n6. Check if there are any additional fees: In addition to customs duties, you may also be required to pay other fees, such as:\n\n   - Merchandise Processing Fee (MPF): A flat fee charged by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for processing commercial shipments. As of 2022, the MPF is $255 for the first $2,500 of the commercial value and $101 for any additional $1,000 ($100 for the first $1,000), up to a maximum of $485.\n\n   - Additional Product Fee (APF): A fee charged on certain consumer products, effective July 1, 2022.\n\n   - Anti-dumping or countervailing duties: If the U.S. government has determined that a foreign producer is selling a product at a lower price than fair value, or if a foreign government is providing an unfair subsidy, additional duties may be applied.\n\n7.

This can be the price you paid for the item, freight charges, insurance, and taxes.\n\n3. **Import Duties**: These are taxes or tariffs that can be calculated based on the imported product's HS Code. You can find the applicable duty rates through the U.S. customs and border protection's Harmonized Tariff Schedule or an online duty calculator.\n\n4. **Freight and Insurance**: These costs can also affect the overall customs value.\n\n5. **Customs Fees (often called \"Customs Brokerage Fees\")**: These fees may be charged by a customs broker to prepare and file the necessary documents to get your shipment through customs.\n\nTo get a more accurate estimate, consider using an online customs duty calculator or consulting a customs broker.

They\u2019re there to guide me, and help me, not form me.\n\nAnother:\n\nPatient: I feel safe enough. I feel I can express that, physically move to something new. It\u2019s a new feeling in myself, a kind of like courage, a feeling like, being held in a space where you are just safe, and feel willing to stretch, and reach out into the world. I have this confidence, I have a knowing, that they\u2019ll watch me, in a way they trust, that they don\u2019t need to contain me, that they\u2019ll give me the space to move forward.\n\nAnother:\n\nPatient: They\u2019re interested in the people I\u2019m interested in. They don\u2019t feel that people are threats to them. They want to support my own connections. They know how important that is.\n\nTherapist: They know how important that is. What effect does that have on your inner state? Patient: It makes me feel I can venture farther. I\u2019m not stealing myself from them. They think it\u2019s a healthy thing I want to go away. They\u2019re happy I can go away, and come back, and I\u2019m my own person.\n\nAnother:\n\nPatient: I can look around more. I\u2019m walking. I can go to places I didn\u2019t want to go to before, to new places. I don\u2019t have to worry about things.\n\nAnother:\n\nPatient: It\u2019s on the street, in a neighborhood where we live. I suggest walking together down the street. And we do. (Pause) And now I\u2019m walking ahead, and I know they\u2019re there behind me, even though I can\u2019t see them. There\u2019s just a weird sense of the neighborhood expanding; no, not the neighborhood expanding, but the comfort expanding, into the world.\n\nIn the expression below, a patient highlights what he experiences as a very significant change in his experience of relationship with his ideal parent figures. This change is clearly the emergence of an internalized secure base:\n\nIt feels like a meeting has taken place among the three of us . . . it feels very different than before . . . it feels like a starting point, like I can start to do things, and they can start to guide me and help me in ways that are right. It feels like the connection has become fully established, rather than becoming established. Up until now it felt like I was trying to feel connection with them . . . now it feels like that\u2019s been established. Now it\u2019s about me being more active, because I have the trust and connection with them now . . . I can do things and return to them . . . for interpretation of what it is I\u2019m doing . . . It\u2019s like a whole new approach to being in a way . . . fundamentally they\u2019re interested in me. I guess I can start to be me, with their guidance . . . they can help me with that . . . they can be supportive in ways I\u2019ve never experienced before.\n\nReinforcing the Internalized Secure Base\n\nWhen signs of a secure base are apparent in the patient\u2019s imagery, the therapist helps to extend, strengthen, and deepen that state by continuing to apply the principles of enhancing desired experiences. These include (1) mirroring, (2) bringing attention to felt experience, (3) amplifying positive states, (4) anchoring positive states in body experience, and (5) suggesting new scenes in which the desired state is also present. All of these appear in the example below:\n\n198 Patient: We\u2019re on a beach, a rocky beach. I can go and get rocks, and come back and give them to them, and they receive them. They pay attention to them, to the details, so we can look at things together.\n\nTherapist: Yes, you can go and get rocks, and then come back to them. Notice what it\u2019s like as you go off by yourself, really feeling that they\u2019re there for you. You can feel that secure feeling, can\u2019t you? Patient: Yes.\n\nTherapist: You can really tune in to that secure feeling now. Feel what that\u2019s like, as you experience the secure feeling right now. What\u2019s the secure feeling like?\n\nPatient: Well, I feel like I can be myself, and do what I want. And even if I\u2019m not with my parents, I know that they\u2019re there for me, if I need them.\n\nTherapist: Yes, you can be yourself. And they\u2019re there for you, when and if you need them. . . . And now this scene fades away, and a new scene is about to appear. In this new scene, you\u2019re also with these parents, and you\u2019re feeling the secure feeling even more strongly. In this new scene, you\u2019re feeling the secure feeling so clearly, and you can be yourself, and do what you want, and you know deep down that these parents are there for you if you need them. As this new scene appears, you can say what\u2019s happening and what it\u2019s like for you.\n\nPatient: Well, we\u2019re at a playground, and I\u2019m playing with other kids. I know my parents are there, but they\u2019re letting me do what I want, playing, and I don\u2019t see them, but I know if I looked for them they\u2019d be there.\n\nTherapist: Yes. You can feel that they\u2019re there for you, while you\u2019re playing and enjoying yourself. Notice what you feel inside now.\n\nPatient: I feel happy. And there\u2019s like a confidence too.\n\nTherapist: You feel happy, and a confidence too. Really feel that happy feeling, and that confidence. And as you feel that, notice how you feel that in your body. What\u2019s it like to feel so happy, and confident, in your body?\n\nPatient: Well, there\u2019s an energy, a good-feeling energy. Like I can be me, and play. I\u2019m safe there. Therapist: Yes, you can be you, with that good-feeling energy, and you\u2019re safe. Feel that even more clearly in your body now. Even more in your body.\n\nYou can really feel it. Become even more familiar with this feeling, and what it\u2019s like as you experience it in your body. And the more you do that the more familiar you\u2019ll become with this goodfeeling energy, being you, being safe. And the more familiar you are with this, the more continuously you\u2019ll be able to feel it and hold it in your awareness. . . . You can really feel it now, can\u2019t you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nTherapist: This safety, this safety. Really feel it, feel it in your body and through your whole being.\n\nWhen a patient is deeply immersed in the imagery, the sense of time can be expanded so that positive states can be experienced as having a longer duration than actual clock time. Time expansion (and contraction) is a common hypnotic technique and is very beneficial for supporting the development of familiarity and mastery of desired qualities. In the interaction with the above patient, the therapist introduced time expansion to reinforce the patient\u2019s experience of safety as follows:\n\nTherapist: And now, even though only a few moments of clock time will pass, it will seem like much longer time elapses, long enough for you to experience this safety in a way that makes it so very familiar to you. You have all the time it takes for this safety to become part of you, to experience it more and more as a foundation of who you are.\n\nWorking With Present Experience and Reducing the Frequency of IPF Sessions\n\nAs indications of internalized secure base appear more consistently and vividly in a patient\u2019s IPF experience, he or she will more and more frequently report signs of greater security in his or her current, day-to-day, between-sessions life. For example, a patient might say, \u201cI find myself sometimes actually enjoying when she touches me\u201d or \u201cWhen he said he was mad at me, I wasn\u2019t as worried that he\u2019d leave me\u201d or \u201cFinally I called a piano teacher and scheduled a first lesson.\u201d In response to these current life manifestations of security, the therapist delights in these new experiences and applies the same reinforcing methods that are used to support positive experiences in the IPF imagery: mirroring and amplifying the positive states and how they are experienced in the body. The IPF method of suggesting new scenes in which desired experiences are also present is modified to make it relevant to the patient\u2019s current life experience. After reinforcing the patient\u2019s", "longest_response": "In the given expressions, it's evident that the patients have made significant progress in developing a sense of internalized secure base with their ideal parent figures. They now feel safe, confident, and free to explore their surroundings and relationships without the fear of being contained or judged.\n\nThe therapist facilitates the strengthening of this secure base attachment by employing various techniques, as described below. These methods are designed to extend, deepen, and anchor the positive feelings associated with security and independence:\n\n1. Mirroring: Reflecting back the patient's emotions and experiences to show understanding and support. For example, \"You can really feel that they\u2019re there for you, when and if you need them.\"\n2. Bringing attention to felt experience: Encouraging the patient to focus on the specific feelings associated with the secure base experience. For example, \"Feel what the secure feeling is like right now.\"\n3. Amplifying positive states: Exaggerating or emphasizing the positive feelings to create a stronger emotional impact. For example, \"Notice what you feel inside now. You feel happy, and a confidence too.\"\n4. Anchoring positive states in body experience: Helping the patient associate the positive feelings with specific body sensations to facilitate easy recall in everyday life. For example, \"What\u2019s it like to feel so happy, and confident, in your body?\"\n5. Suggesting new scenes: Proposing new scenarios in which the patient can experience the desired state more fully and apply it to real-life situations. For example, \"In this new scene, you\u2019re feeling the secure feeling even more strongly. In this new scene, you\u2019re feeling the secure feeling so clearly, and you can be yourself, and do what you want, and you know deep down that these parents are there for you if you need them.\"\n\nTime expansion is also utilized as a technique to increase the duration of positive states, allowing them to become more familiar and ingrained in the patient's consciousness. For example, \"And now, even though only a few moments of clock time will pass, it will seem like much longer time elapses, long enough for you to experience this safety in a way that makes it so very familiar to you.\"\n\nThe therapist also modifies the \"suggesting new scenes\" technique to make it relevant to the patient's current life experience. By reflecting, amplifying, and providing guidance related to the patient's life outside of sessions, the therapist helps the patient integrate and reinforce the sense of security in their daily lives.", "shortest_response": "It seems that the patient in these sessions is experiencing a significant change in their relationship with their ideal parent figures, moving towards the formation of an internalized secure base. This change is allowing the patient to feel safer, more confident, and able to explore and express themselves more freely.\n\nThe therapist is using various techniques to reinforce and enhance this positive internal change. These include mirroring the patient's feelings and experiences, bringing attention to the patient's felt experiences, amplifying positive states, anchoring these states in the patient's body experience, suggesting new scenes in which the desired state is also present, and using time expansion to reinforce these feelings.\n\nThe therapist is also helping the patient to apply these feelings and this sense of safety to their daily life. As the patient experiences these feelings more consistently in their day-to-day life, the frequency of IPF sessions may be reduced as the patient becomes more independent and self-reliant.", "input_size": 2056, "output_sizes": [391, 337, 272, 543, 410, 271, 335, 322, 197, 261], "output_mean": 333.9, "output_std": 92.07, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 271.25, "p50": 328.5, "p75": 377.5, "p99": 531.03}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 26.73314}, {"sample_id": "f096366ef4b8dd74", "prompt_id": "0de4759258cbdfa1", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "We are an established bicycle company and now starting a new business selling 3D printed carbon fiber bicycles in the USA region, with a focus on speed, adventure and\nsports models.

Explain the first normal form (1NF) with an example.", "longest_response": "Normalization in database design is a process aimed at organizing data in a table to minimize redundancy and dependency, improving data integrity, ease of updates, and efficient use of storage space. The normal forms (NF) are a series of rules or criteria for organizing data in a table to ensure a well-structured, optimized, and easily manageable database.\n\nThere are several normal forms, with First Normal Form (1NF) being the first and the most basic. A table is said to be in 1NF if it adheres to the following three rules:\n\n1. **Atomicness (or indivisibility):** Every column should contain only atomic values (indivisible, non-composite values), meaning that each value in a column should be separate and indivisible, and not a combination of multiple values. For example, instead of storing a full address, such as \"123 Main St, Anytown, USA,\" in a single column, separate columns should be used for street, city, and country.\n\n2. **No repeating groups:** No group of columns should be repeated for each row if those columns contain data that pertain to different categories of data. For example, suppose we have a table for books with multiple columns for author details (e.g., authors1Name, authors1Age, authors1Nationality, authors2Name, authors2Age, authors2Nationality, ...), which is bad practice because it represents a repeating group. Instead, a separate authors table should be created to hold the details of each author and linked to the books table using a foreign key.\n\n3. **Unique keys:** Every row in the table should have a unique identifier (or primary key) that can unambiguously identify the data in that row.\n\nHere's an example of a table showing books and their authors before and after applying 1NF:\n\n**Before (non-1NF table):**\n\n| BookID | Title       | Author1Name  | Author1Age  | Author1Nationality | Author2Name  | Author2Age  | Author2Nationality |\n|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1      | To Kill a Mockingbird | Harper Lee  | 55| American | N/A      | N/A      | N/A             |\n| 2      | The Great Gatsby   | F.

It consists of a series of rules or processes known as normal forms (NFs) to organize data in a logical and consistent manner.\n\nThe main benefits of normalization are:\n\n1. Eliminating redundant data: This reduces the size of the database, saving storage space.\n2. Ensuring data integrity: Normalization helps prevent inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and anomalies in the data.\n3. Simplifying data manipulation: Normalized databases are easier to update, modify, and manage, as changes made to one piece of data don't affect other unrelated pieces.\n\nFirst Normal Form (1NF) is the initial level of database normalization, ensuring that the table (or relation) has the following properties:\n\n1. Each column must contain atomic (indivisible) values: Each column should store one kind of data, and the values within the column should be indivisible. For example, if a table records employee information, the 'Name' column should not split a person's first and last name into separate columns.\n\n2. Each row must be unique: Every row in the table must have a unique identifier, called a primary key. It ensures that no two rows have the same values for the primary key.\n\n3. Each column must have a unique name: Each column within the table should be named uniquely to avoid confusion.\n\nAn example of a table in First Normal Form (1NF) would be a simple employee table, where each row represents a unique employee and each column contains atomic data:\n\n| EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName | Department |\n|------------|-----------|----------|------------|\n| 1          | John      | Doe      | IT         |\n| 2          | Jane      | Smith    | HR         |\n| 3          | Bob       | Johnson  | Finance    |\n\nIn this example, we know that each row is unique because of the EmployeeID column, the table avoids storing redundant data by keeping each employee's name in the appropriate column, and the table has unique column names.", "input_size": 28, "output_sizes": [609, 614, 603, 528, 542, 755, 635, 475, 833, 542], "output_mean": 613.6, "output_std": 102.72, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 542.0, "p50": 606.0, "p75": 629.75, "p99": 825.98}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 19.98075}, {"sample_id": "0ff77d76b6768c4d", "prompt_id": "d71bfa858fd3ec2f", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "if 60tb is usd 9135.45, how much is 1gb?", "longest_response": "To find the cost of 1 GB, we first need to know how many gigabytes (GB) are in a terabyte (TB).\n\n1 TB = 1024 GB (since 1 TB = 1024 GB)\n\nNow, let's convert the given cost from 60 TB to the cost of 1 GB.\n\nFirst, calculate the cost of 1 TB:\n\nCost of 1 TB = USD 9135.45 / 60 TB = USD 152.25833333333334\n\nSince 1 GB = 1/1024th of a TB, let's find the cost of 1 GB:\n\nCost of 1 GB = Cost of 1 TB / (1 TB * 1024 GB) = USD 152.25833333333334 / (1024 GB)\n\nTo find the cost in USD per GB, we'll multiply by the reciprocal of 1024.\n\nCost of 1 GB = (USD 152.25833333333334 / (1024 GB)) * (1 / 1) = USD 0.14701586327380956\n\nSo, 1 GB costs approximately USD 0.147016.", "shortest_response": "To find the cost of 1GB, we will first find the cost of 1TB (since 1TB equals 1024GB), then divide that cost by 1024 to get the cost of 1GB.\n\n1TB costs $9135.45.

They are all perfect logicians -- if a conclusion can be logically deduced, they will do it instantly. No one knows the color of their eyes. Every night at midnight, a ferry stops at the island. Any islanders who have figured out the color of their own eyes then leave the island, and the rest stay. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a count of the number of people they see with each eye color (excluding themselves), but they cannot otherwise communicate. Everyone on the island knows all the rules in this paragraph.\n\nOn this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people, and the Guru (she happens to have green eyes). So any given blue-eyed person can see 100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes (and one with green), but that does not tell him his own eye color; as far as he knows the totals could be 101 brown and 99 blue. Or 100 brown, 99 blue, and he could have red eyes.\n\nThe Guru is allowed to speak once (let's say at noon), on one day in all their endless years on the island. Standing before the islanders, she says the following:\n\n\"I can see someone who has blue eyes.\"\n\nWho leaves the island, and on what night?\nThere are no mirrors or reflecting surfaces, nothing dumb. It is not a trick question, and the answer is logical. It doesn't depend on tricky wording or anyone lying or guessing, and it doesn't involve people doing something silly like creating a sign language or doing genetics. The Guru is not making eye contact with anyone in particular; she's simply saying \"I count at least one blue-eyed person on this island who isn't me.\"\n\nAnd lastly, the answer is not \"no one leaves.\"", "longest_response": "The Guru's statement, \"I can see someone who has blue eyes,\" means that there is at least one blue-eyed person who has not yet figured out their own eye color.\n\nHere's the logic behind it:\n\n1. Every brown-eyed person knows they have brown eyes because they see exactly 100 brown-eyed people and 100 blue-eyed people (including the Guru with green eyes). Since there are 200 people in total, they cannot have blue eyes.\n2. Every blue-eyed person with 101 brown-eyed people and 99 blue-eyed people or more in their sight cannot be the one the Guru is referring to. This is because they would see at least 101 potential blue-eyed people and eliminate the Guru with their green eyes, leaving them with at least 100 blue-eyed people in their sight, which means they would know they have blue eyes themselves.\n3. However, there are also blue-eyed people who see 99 blue-eyed people and 100 brown-eyed people (plus the Guru with green eyes). These individuals cannot exclude the possibility that they could be the one the Guru is referring to, because they do not know if the Guru is one of the 99 blue-eyed people they see or not.\n4. Therefore, the blue-eyed person who sees 99 blue-eyed people and 100 brown-eyed people (including the Guru) will leave the island on the night following the Guru's announcement, as they now know their eye color is blue.\n5. If a blue-eyed person is not convinced by the Guru's statement and does not leave, the Guru could repeat her statement the next day, which would convince the last blue-eyed person. However, in this specific scenario, the blue-eyed person who sees 99 blue-eyed people will be convinced after the Guru's first statement and leave the following night.", "shortest_response": "The Guru's statement implies that there must be at least one blue-eyed person who can see himself.

This is because after the Guru speaks, all blue-eyed people realize that they must be the person the Guru saw, and they figure out their eye color. The person with blue eyes will leave the island the night after the Guru's statement, as he has now figured out he has blue eyes.\n\nSo, the person who leaves the island on the next night after the Guru's speech is the blue-eyed individual who could see himself.", "input_size": 442, "output_sizes": [205, 251, 357, 303, 221, 200, 402, 248, 432, 181], "output_mean": 280.0, "output_std": 84.63, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 209.0, "p50": 249.5, "p75": 343.5, "p99": 429.3}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 11.61887}, {"sample_id": "44db57756357c704", "prompt_id": "63b6a2bf8cd177ad", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Today I am looking at scenes in Midjourney.

His ultimate goal is to see TechNova expand its product line and capture more market share. He believes that taking risks and adopting new technologies is essential to achieve this goal. The underlying interest here is maintaining the company's competitive edge, preserving its reputation for innovation, and ensuring long-term financial success.\n\nJamie's Position: Jamie, on the other hand, is the more conservative partner, focused on financial stability and cost management. She wants to ensure that the company's financial resources are allocated wisely and that there is a consistent return on investment. Her primary concern is mitigating risk and making fiscally sound decisions to safeguard company assets and profitability. The underlying interest behind her position is financial security, stability, and the sustainability of TechNova's growth over the long term.\n\nLevel of trust: The relationship between Alex and Jamie has deteriorated due to disagreements and misunderstandings. There is a lack of trust, with each party questioning the other's decisions and motives. Both have become defensive, unable to effectively communicate their concerns or listen to each other's perspective.\n\nBuilding Trust: For the mediation to be successful and move towards rebuilding trust, the following steps may help:\n\n1. Active Listening: Each participant should make an effort to actively listen to the other, without interrupting or dismissing their concerns. This will help each party feel heard and understood.\n\n2. Clear Communication: Both Alex and Jamie need to clearly communicate their goals, concerns, and expectations for the future of TechNova.

Transparency and Accountability: To build trust, both Alex and Jamie should maintain transparency in their decision-making process and hold themselves accountable for their actions. This will demonstrate their commitment to the partnership and foster an environment where open discussion and collaboration can thrive.\n\n5. Acknowledging Each Other's Contributions: Recognizing the value that both partners bring to the table can help strengthen their relationship. Acknowledging each other's strengths and achievements, and actively supporting one another's goals, can help rebuild the trust that has been compromised.\n\n6.

You can adjust the color values to fit your needs. Keep in mind that supported color names are case-insensitive, and you can find a list of supported colors in the [Adaptive Cards color documentation](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Color.html).\n\nRemember that the color styles are just hints. Not all hosts will honor these hints, and some may require you to use their specific mechanisms for setting background colors.\n\nMore information regarding Adaptive Cards can be found in the [Adaptive Cards language reference documentation](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/).", "shortest_response": "To change the background color of an adaptive card, you need to use JSON and a specific property called `styles`. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"AdaptiveCard\",\n    \"body\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"TextBlock\",\n            \"text\": \"This is my card\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"actions\": [],\n    \"style\": {\n        \"title\": \"Large\",\n        \"backgroundImage\": \"\",\n        \"foregroundColor\": \"accent\",\n        \"backgroundColor\": \"#FF0000\" // change this to your preferred hex color code\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, the `backgroundColor` property is used to set the background color. You can replace `#FF0000` with your desired hex color code.\n\nPlease note that not all platforms support the `backgroundColor` property. For example, as of now, Teams does not support it. For platforms that don't support it, you'll have to use different strategies (like using images with a solid color or CSS gradients for dark mode support) to achieve the desired effect.\n\nYou can find more information about Adaptive Cards styling in Microsoft's official documentation: https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/style.html", "input_size": 13, "output_sizes": [527, 337, 428, 626, 444, 528, 303, 515, 411, 525], "output_mean": 464.4, "output_std": 93.37, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 415.25, "p50": 479.5, "p75": 526.5, "p99": 617.18}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 14.12855}, {"sample_id": "607f281185c502fb", "prompt_id": "7dd700312867a5a1", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "still error : PS C:\\Users\\Dan.QTIS\\Desktop\\Dan\\All Projects Full\\Ai App> c:;

H-1B Cap-Gap Extension: If you are on an F-1 visa, have a timely H-1B petition approved, and the H-1B start date is October 1, you may be eligible for an automatic H-1B Cap-Gap extension. This allows you to maintain your status and continue to work remotely for the sponsoring employer during the Cap-Gap period, which is in between the F-1 OPT and H-1B start date.\n\n2. H-1B Premium Processing: In certain situations, such as change of employer, an extension, or an amendment, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may allow premium processing for H-1B petitions, which can significantly reduce the processing time and allow you to start working while the petition is pending.\n\n3. Specialty Occupation: If your remote position meets the definition of a specialty occupation and you possess the necessary qualifications, your employer may still be able to sponsor you for an H-1B visa. Keep in mind that the position must be a \"bona fide\" full-time, permanent job that is not intended to circumvent the intent of the H-1B visa program.\n\n4.

However, this option is very limited, and you should consult with an immigration attorney before proceeding.\n\nRemember, the USCIS closely scrutinizes remote work arrangements to ensure compliance with the immigration laws and regulations.

Legal Advice\nYour building lawyer knows every aspect of a commercial contract that can either make or break your building project. Getting a lawyer involved earlier can guarantee you a seamless execution of the agreements in the contract. It will also less likely get you in a legal dispute.\n2. Contract Drafting\nSome disputes root from vague and badly written contracts. So it is important that everything written in your commercial contracts is clear. With the help of your building lawyer, any detail that needs to be removed, revised or added can easily be pointed out by your lawyer.\n3. Contract Review\nThere are a lot of things to look out for when reviewing a contract. Especially if it is a building contract. A building and construction lawyer can review your contract and point out any information that may seem vague or statements that can get you in trouble.\n\nAside from vague statements and details, it is also important to note that contract review includes checking if the contract is in written form, if all details are correct, if it includes dispute resolutions, and other important agreements to make sure the building process flows smoothly.\n\nWhy should you get your Commercial Contracts checked?\n1. Avoid bigger disputes.\nGetting involved in a building project is already stressful. You don\u2019t want another stress getting involved in a legal dispute. It spends too much time, money, and effort. So to make sure that you don\u2019t experience these struggles, seeking the right legal advice from the right person can do you a lot of help.\n2. Avoid any confusion.\nAny detail in your contract that seems ambiguous should be clarified and cleared out with the other party. It would be hard for the both of you if any confusion and misunderstanding arises halfway the building process. Worse, this could lead to a legal dispute and we don\u2019t want that.\n3. You don't miss anything.\nA building contract is like the detailed plan of the whole building project. When unexpected happenings suddenly occur, you have your contract to go back to. So when drafting a building contract, it is very important that there are more than just two voices speaking and more than two brains working together. Getting a legal expert to be part of the planning and contract drafting can give you assurance that anything that needs to be included in the contract is a preparation for both the expected and the unexpected.\n\nHow can Contracts Specialist help with Commercial Contracts?\nContracts Specialist is a Sydney-based law firm specialising in building and construction law.

First, install the necessary dependencies:\n\n```bash\npip install fastapi[all] passlib[bcrypt] python-jose[cryptography]ALEmbedding cookiecutter\n```\n\n2. Create a new FastAPI instance:\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, status\nfrom fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm\nfrom jose import JWTError, jwt\nfrom passlib.context import CryptContext\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n```\n\n3. Set up the secret key and algorithm for JWT:\n\n```python\nSECRET_KEY = \"your-secret-key\"\nALGORITHM = \"HS256\"\n```\n\n4. Create a password hasher instance:\n\n```python\npwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=[\"bcrypt\"], deprecated=\"auto\")\n```\n\n5. Define a function to verify the user's password:\n\n```python\ndef verify_password(plain_password, hashed_password):\n    return pwd_context.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)\n```\n\n6. Define a function to create a hashed password:\n\n```python\ndef get_password_hash(password):\n    return pwd_context.hash(password)\n```\n\n7. Define a function to create a JWT:\n\n```python\ndef create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: Union[timedelta, None] = None):\n    to_encode = data.copy()\n    if expires_delta:\n        expire = datetime.utcnow() + expires_delta\n    else:\n        expire = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=15)\n    to_encode.update({\"exp\": expire})\n    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)\n    return encoded_jwt\n```\n\n8. Define an OAuth2PasswordBearer instance. In this case, it doesn't require a specific client_id or client_secret since FastAPI doesn't support scopes out of the box:\n\n```python\noauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl=\"token\")\n```\n\n9. Create a function to authenticate the user:\n\n```python\nasync def authenticate_user(fake_db, username: str, password: str):\n    user = get_user(fake_db, username)\n    if not user:\n        return False\n    if not verify_password(password, user.hashed_password):\n        return False\n    return user\n```\n\n10.

You can also add a login route to handle the token creation:\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, status\nfrom fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordRequestForm\n\n@router.post(\"/token\", response_model=Token)\nasync def login(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):\n    user = await authenticate_user(fake_db, form_data.username, form_data.password)\n    if not user:\n        raise HTTPException(\n            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,\n            detail=\"Incorrect username or password\",\n            headers={\"WWW-Authenticate\": \"Bearer\"},\n        )\n    access_token_expires = timedelta(minutes=AccessTokenExpireMinutes)\n    access_token = create_access_token(\n        data={\"sub\": user.username}, expires_delta=access_token_expires\n    )\n    return Token(access_token=access_token, token_type=\"bearer\")\n```", "shortest_response": "Yes, I can guide you on how to integrate OAuth2 with FastAPI. Here's a simple example using the PyOAuth2 library for Google OAuth2:\n\nFirst, install the necessary packages:\n\n```bash\npip install fastapi pyoauth2[google]\n```\n\nNext, create a FastAPI instance:\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException\nfrom google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials\nfrom googleapiclient.discovery import build\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n# Google Client ID and Client Secret from the Google API Console\nGOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = \"your_client_id\"\nGOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = \"your_client_secret\"\nSCOPES = [\"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile\"]\n\n# Load credentials from a JSON file\ndef get_google_credentials():\n    creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file(\"credentials.json\", SCOPES)\n    if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:\n        creds.refresh(Request())\n    return creds\n\ngoogle_credentials = get_google_credentials()\n\ngoogle_service = build(\"oauth2\", \"v2\", credentials=google_credentials)\n\n@app.get(\"/login\")\ndef login():\n    return {\"message\": \"Please go to this URL to authorize: {}\".format(\n        google_service.oauth2.authorization_url(access_type=\"offline\", scope=SCOPES))}\n\n@app.get(\"/callback\")\ndef callback(code: str = Depends(login)):\n    token_resp = google_service.oauth2.token(\n        code=code,\n        redirect_uri=\"http://localhost:8000/callback\",\n        grant_type=\"authorization_code\",\n    )\n\n    if not token_resp or not \"access_token\" in token_resp:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=\"Invalid token response\")\n\n    access_token = token_resp[\"access_token\"]\n    userinfo_resp = google_service.oauth2.userinfo().get().execute()\n\n    return {\"userinfo\": userinfo_resp}\n```\n\nIn this example, we have a login endpoint that redirects the user to Google for authorization, and a callback endpoint that exchanges the authorization code for an access token and user information. The OAuth2 flow is handled by Google's authentication and authorization APIs, while FastAPI provides the web server and routing.\n\nDon't forget to create a JSON file named `credentials.json` in your project folder with the following structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"web\": {\n    \"client_id\": \"your_client_id\",\n    \"client_secret\": \"your_client_secret\",\n    \"redirect_uris\": [\n      \"http://localhost:8000/callback\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```", "input_size": 16, "output_sizes": [749, 1224, 804, 1129, 895, 1122, 1167, 717, 1292, 1277], "output_mean": 1037.6, "output_std": 212.13, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 826.75, "p50": 1125.5, "p75": 1209.75, "p99": 1290.65}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 34.49745}, {"sample_id": "6bc4c3866198d030", "prompt_id": "c8ddeb16364e3b5a", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "how to run a nats server with a local docker. the server should run on another port than the default and needs to have jetstream enabled. the nats server storage should be in a volume that persists the data when the container is restarted.", "longest_response": "To run a NATS server with Docker, enable JetStream, and specify a custom port, while using a volume for data persistence, follow the steps below:\n\n1.

Hailing from this celestial body was Krypton-Zeron, a being of immense power and unparalleled intellect, known throughout the cosmos as Superman. His heart was as kind as his demeanor was noble, and his strength second only to the power of creation itself.\n\nOne fateful night, a mysterious signal from an ancient planet, Earth, caught his attention. The call originated from the decrepit, sinister walls of a crumbling sanctuary, better known in his realm as \"The Convent of the Veil\" or, to the indigenous inhabitants, as the haunted castle of the Nun.\n\nPart II: The Confrontation\n\nSuperman, driven by his curiosity and boundless compassion, journeyed to Earth, arriving in the desolate, eerie surroundings of the castle. It was a palace of shadows and whispers, a testament to the power of fear and darkness. As he approached the castle gates, he felt a sudden chill run down his spine \u2013 the first inklings of the malevolent presence that resided there.\n\nHowever, Superman stood unfazed, a beacon of hope in the darkness that enveloped him. As the castle walls groaned in torment, the spectral figure of the Nun emerged, her skeletal visage shrouded in tattered robes, her eyes burning with an unholy flame. She stretched out her gnarled hand, beckoning the newcomer who dared to intrude upon her domain. \"Leave now, creature of light,\" she hissed with venom, \"or be damned for all eternity!\"\n\nBut Superman only smiled - a smile that seemed to fill the castle with its warmth. \"I have come to lay this darkness to rest, Nun,\" he said, his voice resonating with authority.\n\nPart III: Battle of Light and Darkness\n\nA battle of epic proportions then ensued. The Nun, drawing upon the dark energies of the castle, unleashed wave after wave of spectral torment upon the alien hero. Yet, Superman, his heart burning with unwavering conviction, matched her attack for attack. His fists struck with the force of thunder, shattering the castle's ancient stone walls.\n\nTemptation crept in, whispering in his mind, urging him to yield to the darkness and join forces with the Nun. But Superman remembered his mission, his purpose, his love for his world \u2013 his family, his friends, and those he had sworn to protect. And with renewed determination, Superman faced off against the Nun, the battle raging through the castle's winding passageways and labyrinthine chambers.\n\nPart IV: The Turning Point\n\nThe castle, once a fortress of darkness, began to change. Cracks gradually appeared in the Nun's defenses as Superman's unyielding light infiltrated her domain. This was unfathomable to the Nun, who could not comprehend the source of this power that threatened to destroy her.\n\nIn a bid to save herself, the Nun resorted to her most potent weapon \u2013 the power to possess the living. Trapping Superman's spirit within Earthly vessels, she sought to break him from within. However, unable to penetrate the shield of the Man of Steel's indomitable heart, she found her efforts to be in vain.\n\nPart V: The Final Stand\n\nIn a climactic confrontation, Superman and the Nun found themselves locked in a fiery embrace atop the castle's highest tower. As the castle crumbled beneath them, she snarled, \"You shall never defeat me, being of light! I shall live on through the souls of those I possess!\"\n\n\"No,\" Superman replied, his eyes burning with resolve, \"you shall not! Your reign of terror ends now!\"\n\nWith one mighty effort, Superman tore free from the Nun's grasp. Using the last of his energy, he hurled her into the swirling abyss below \u2013 the castle collapsing along with her, never to haunt another soul again.\n\nPart VI: The Aftermath\n\nWith the Nun's demise, the castle's evil aura dissipated, leaving only the faintest whispers of its once-terrifying presence. Superman, his body battered and bruised, looked out over the peaceful landscape below, knowing that he had fulfilled his mission.\n\nSensing that it was time for him to return to his own world, he bid farewell to the people of Earth, leaving them with a newfound hope in the power of strength and unity. And as he soared into the heavens, a glimmer of hope remained within the Convent of the Veil.\n\nJust perhaps, one day, a hero would arise who would be strong enough to step forth and rebuild \u2013 not just the crumbling sanctuary, but the hearts and souls that had been tainted by darkness. The legend of the Nun may have ended, but her tale would serve as a reminder. A reminder that even in the darkest of places, there is always hope, always light.\n\nAnd so, the story of the superman who visited the haunted castle continued to inspire generations to come, their hearts burning with the light of hope and the promise of a brighter future. \u269b\ufe0f.", "shortest_response": "Title: \"The Divine Visitant: A Supernatural Clash\"\n\nIn the vast, cosmic expanse, a solitary spacecraft blazed a trail, heading towards Earth. Within this marvel of technology, stood a figure far beyond human comprehension - Ultrus, the Kryptonian-Xonn- hybrid, a being of celestial origin, blessed with powers far surpassing those of mortal men, yet cursed with an eternal loneliness. His mission: to explore the realm of the unexplained, to test his mettle against the supernatural forces that haunted humanity.\n\nHis first destination was a haunted castle, a chilling fortress of stone and shadow that echoed the ominous presence of the demonic Nun, known as Valak. As Ultrus materialized, the air around him crackled with energy, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe and twist with malevolent intent.\n\nValak, sensing the alien presence, lashed out with spectral tendrils, their icy touch leaving no scars but causing a cold, profound fear to seize Ultrus' heart. Yet, he stood defiant, his eyes flashing with an unyielding strength that belied his alien nature. He was no mere mortal, and he would not be swayed by mere terrors.\n\nThe battle raged throughout the night, the castle shaking with each burst of strength. Ultrus, using his heat vision, scorched the walls, reducing the shadows to ashes. Valak, in return, summoned torrents of icy wind, trying to freeze the alien visitor solid. But Ultrus stood steadfast, his indomitable will never wavering.\n\nThe climax came when Ultrus, using his super speed, managed to physically grab Valak. The Nun, seeing the power she could not match, tried to beg for mercy, but the words were lost in her twisted, writhing form. Ultrus, showing a rare flash of compassion, banished Valak back to the demonic realm from which she came, sealing the castle and ending her reign of terror.\n\nIn the aftermath, Ultrus found himself touched by the human spirit, their resilience and courage inspiring him.

Here are some techniques you can use:\n\n1. **Logging**: Log the name of the view function in the `views.py` file at the beginning of each view. You can use Python's built-in `logging` module for this.\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\ndef my_view(request):\n    logger.info(\"My view was called\")\n    # Your view logic here\n```\n\nMake sure to configure Django to show the log output during the development process. You can do this in your `settings.py` file:\n\n```python\nLOGGING = {\n    'version': 1,\n    'disable_existing_loggers': False,\n    'handlers': {\n        'console': {\n            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',\n        },\n    },\n    'root': {\n        'handlers': ['console'],\n        'level': 'DEBUG',\n    },\n}\n```\n\n2. **Django Debug Toolbar**: Install the Django Debug Toolbar package using pip, and configure it in your settings. This provides you with lots of useful information, including which view is being called.\n\n```\npip install django-debug-toolbar\n```\n\nAdd it to your `INSTALLED_APPS` and `MIDDLEWARE` in `settings.py`:\n\n```python\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n    # ...\n    'debug_toolbar',\n]\n\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n    # ...\n    'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware',\n]\n```\n\n3. **Using `request.path`**: In your views, you can use `request.path` to compare the current URL with the expected URL for the view.\n\n```python\ndef my_view(request):\n    if request.path == '/my_app/my_view/':\n        # This is the view you're interested in\n        # Your view logic here\n    else:\n        # Another view or an error\n```\n\n4. **Using a breakpoint**: You can use a breakpoint in your view function to stop the execution and examine variables at runtime. This can be done using different Python debuggers like pdb or ipdb. To use pdb, simply add `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` at the point where you want to debug inside your view function.\n\n```python\ndef my_view(request):\n    # ...\n    import pdb; pdb.set_trace()\n    # ...\n```\n\n5. **Django shell plus**: Use `django-shellplus` package to run the Django shell with the project's settings and middleware configured. You can then simulate requests and see which view is called for a particular URL.\n\n```\npip install django-shellplus\n```\n\nIn your command line, run:\n\n```bash\nshell_plus -c 'from myapp.views import my_view; my_view(request)'\n```\n\nReplace `myapp` and `my_view` with your app name and view function.\n\nThese methods can help you find out which view is getting called in your Django project.", "shortest_response": "To debug which view is getting called in Django, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. ** Enable Django Debug Toolbar**: This is an extension for the Django Web framework that provides various pieces of useful information for debugging web applications. Install it using pip: `pip install django-debug-toolbar` and then add it to your INSTALLED_APPS and MIDDLEWARE in your settings.py.\n\n2. ** Use the Django Built-in Debug Page**: If you haven't enabled the debug mode already, do so by setting `DEBUG = True` in your settings.py. When an error occurs, Django will show a detailed traceback in the browser that can help you determine which view is causing the issue.\n\n3. ** Use Print Statements**: In your views, you can use Python print statements to log the name of the view as it gets executed. For example:\n\n```python\ndef my_view(request):\n    print(__name__)  # This will print the name of the current view\n    # Your code here...\n```\n\n4. ** Logging**: Django provides a logging system that can be used to log messages to the console. You can use something like `logging.info('In my_view')` in your views to log the name of the view.\n\n5. ** URL Dispatcher Debugging**: Django's URL dispatcher can be debugged by using the `show_detail_views` setting. Set it to True in your settings.py:\n\n```python\nDEBUG_PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS = True\nSHOW_DETAIL_VIEWS = True\n```\n\nWhen an exception occurs, Django will show additional information about the URL dispatcher, including a list of views that match the requested URL.", "input_size": 13, "output_sizes": [401, 581, 614, 759, 550, 505, 398, 477, 715, 504], "output_mean": 550.4, "output_std": 114.34, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 483.75, "p50": 527.5, "p75": 605.75, "p99": 755.04}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 17.7515}, {"sample_id": "f010a8856ecb15b7", "prompt_id": "045849e53d985d43", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "base one this\"The circular economy is a production and consumption model aimed at keeping resources in use for as long as possible by changing the way we produce, consume, and utilize resources, thereby reducing emissions from resource extraction, manufacturing, transportation, and disposal. and extracting the maximum value from them before recovering and regenerating materials at the end of their service life. \n\nAccording to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a leading circular economy advocacy group, a circular economy can help reduce global carbon emissions by 9.3 billion tons by 2050, equivalent to eliminating current emissions from all forms of transport globally.

This includes designing products for longevity and recyclability, using recycled materials in production processes, developing new business models that promote sharing or leasing of products rather than ownership, and collaborating with partners across industries to create closed-loop systems for materials and components.\n\nAccording to Volvo's sustainability report, the company's circular economy initiatives have already resulted in significant environmental benefits, including:\n\n95% of Volvo cars produced in 2018 were designed for recyclability, with the goal of increasing this to 100% by 2025.\n95% of Volvo cars are already recycled at the end of their life, with the goal of increasing this to 100% by 2030.\nThe use of recycled plastics in Volvo cars increased by 50% in 2018 compared to the previous year.\nVolvo aims to use at least 25% recycled plastics in all new cars from 2025 onwards.\nOverall, Volvo's circular economy initiatives reflect a commitment to reducing its environmental impact while promoting ethical business practices that benefit society as a whole.\" give a section title", "longest_response": "\"Volvo's Embrace of the Circular Economy: Reducing Waste, Promoting Resource Efficiency, and Sustainable Manufacturing\"", "shortest_response": "\"Volvo's Embracement and Progress in Circular Economy\"", "input_size": 634, "output_sizes": [20, 26, 26, 30, 20, 28, 17, 34, 25, 21], "output_mean": 24.7, "output_std": 4.96, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 20.25, "p50": 25.5, "p75": 27.5, "p99": 33.64}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 1.15727}, {"sample_id": "1b9fa3ecbda91702", "prompt_id": "07d418f4dbb11d2d", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "write a long essay about the philosophy of Jean baudrillard include lengthy excerpt passages from his writing", "longest_response": "Title: The Philosophical Lens of Jean Baudrillard: A Journey Through Hyperreality and the Postmodern Landscape\n\nJean Baudrillard (1929-2007), a French philosopher, sociologist, and cultural critic, was a significant figure in the development of postmodern thought. His work was heavily influenced by the ideas of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, yet he sought to navigate the unique challenges and complexities of contemporary society that these thinkers could not fully anticipate. Baudrillard's oeuvre is vast and multifaceted, with his primary concerns being the effects of technology, consumerism, and media on the construction of reality.\n\nOne of Baudrillard's most influential concepts is the notion of hyperreality. In his 1981 essay, \"Simulacra and Simulation,\" he argues that contemporary society is characterized by the dominance of simulacra over the real. Simulacra, in Baudrillard's sense, are representations without originals\u2014replicas that are no longer tied to their referents but function as self-sufficient illusions. He asserts:\n\n\"The simulacrum is never what hides the truth\u2014it is the truth that hides the fact that there is none. The simulacrum of the real is not in the order of the false, as a simple negation of the real, but rather it is part of the real, because it comes after the real. It is hyper-real.\" (Baudrillard, 1994, p.1)\n\nFor Baudrillard, the proliferation of simulacra signifies the end of traditional notions of truth and reality. In the age of mass media and digital technology, the distinction between the real and the artificial becomes increasingly blurred. Moreover, the significance of events lies not in their occurrence but in their representation, as the media-saturated environment constructs our perception of reality.\n\nA pivotal example of Baudrillard's ideas can be found in his analysis of the Gulf War (1991) in his 1995 book, \"The Gulf War Did Not Take Place.\" He argues that the war was primarily a media event, with the actual military conflict serving merely as a pretext for the broadcast of images, reports, and commentaries. Consequently, the war's reality was constructed through media representations, leading Baudrillard to assert that:\n\n\"The Gulf War has not taken place\u2014it has been simulated. Rather than displaying a conflict, the media have manufactured a hyper-reality, a sort of paranoid schizophrenia where the relations between things and their images are reversed. Our war, our victories, our peace are no longer real, just as our defeats are no longer real.\" (Baudrillard, 1995, p.2)\n\nBaudrillard not only highlights the dangers of hyperreality but also critiques the complicity of contemporary society in perpetuating this condition. He challenges the notion that individuals can maintain autonomy in the face of pervasive media and consumer culture, arguing instead that they are victims of this system.\n\nIn addition to the concept of hyperreality, Baudrillard's work is marked by his exploration of the loss of symbolic meaning in contemporary postmodern society. In his 1972 book, \"The Systems of Objects,\" he analyzes the relationship between objects and human subjectivity. He argues that consumption, rather than satisfying human desires, creates a void that can only be filled through continued accumulation. Objects are no longer imbued with symbolic meaning but are instead reduced to signs that serve the perpetuation of the consumer system.\n\nBaudrillard's ideas have significant implications for our understanding of contemporary society and the role of media, consumerism, and technology in shaping our perception of reality. His work serves as a profound critique of the postmodern condition and offers a challenging perspective on the nature of truth and objective reality.\n\nReferences:\n\nBaudrillard, J. (1981).

His ideas challenge conventional notions of reality, truth, and authenticity, offering a unique perspective on the world we inhabit.\n\nOne of Baudrillard's most renowned concepts is the theory of the simulacrum, developed in his seminal work, \"Simulacra and Simulation\" (1981). According to Baudrillard, a simulacrum is a representation with no correspondence to any reality whatsoever. In his words, \"The simulacrum is never what hides the truth\u2014it is the truth that hides the fact that there is none.\"\n\nBaudrillard argues that we have entered an era beyond representational reality, where the real and the imaginary have merged and lost their distinctive characteristics. He suggests that modern society has produced a 'hyperreality'\u2014a world where the simulacra surpass the reality they were designed to represent, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of illusion.\n\nIn \"Simulacra and Simulation,\" Baudrillard explores this idea by analyzing various examples of hyperreality, such as Disneyland, a theme park embodying an idealized and sanitized version of American history. Baudrillard claims that Disneyland is not an imitation of the real world, but rather the real world is an imitation of Disneyland. He writes, \"Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real, whereas all of Los Angeles and the America that surrounds it are no longer real, but belong to the hyperreal order and to the order of simulation.\"\n\nAnother key concept in Baudrillard's philosophy is the 'death of the author,' which he discusses in \"The Death of the Author\" (1968). Here, Baudrillard challenges the traditional notion of authorship and argues that the text itself has more meaning than its author. He claims that the reader's interpretation is more important than the author's intentions, as the text can be multiple, endless, and indeterminate.\n\nIn \"The Ecstasy of Communication\" (1987), Baudrillard delves into the impact of technology and communication on contemporary society, suggesting that they have created a world of superficial connections devoid of real content or meaning. He writes, \"The media is the medium that makes reality disappear and brings about the end of the real, and thus of history, politics, and society.\"\n\nBaudrillard's philosophy has been both praised and criticized. His works have inspired countless scholars, artists, and activists, while also being dismissed as nihilistic and overly pessimistic. Regardless of one's stance, it is undeniable that Baudrillard's ideas have significantly shaped contemporary discussions on culture, society, and the nature of reality.\n\nIn conclusion, Jean Baudrillard's philosophy offers a unique and challenging perspective on modern society, consumer culture, and media. Through his concepts of simulacra, hyperreality, and the death of the author, Baudrillard challenges conventional notions of reality, authenticity, and authorship, inviting us to question the world we inhabit. As we navigate through the labyrinth of his thought-provoking ideas, we are reminded of the complexities and paradoxes that define our contemporary existence.", "input_size": 28, "output_sizes": [948, 966, 1019, 1022, 976, 827, 1007, 883, 925, 827], "output_mean": 940.0, "output_std": 69.64, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 893.5, "p50": 957.0, "p75": 999.25, "p99": 1021.73}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 25.70106}, {"sample_id": "dc23e03dcd27cbfb", "prompt_id": "a68d650682f548ff", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "read excel in Node.JS", "longest_response": "To read Excel files in Node.js, you can use a package called `xlsx`.

Haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry that has gained popularity worldwide. Here's a simple breakdown of what a Haiku is and how to write one:\n\n1. Definition: A Haiku is a short poem that originally had a 5-7-5 syllable structure. In English, the strict syllable count isn't as critical, but the spirit of the form remains.\n\n2. Structure: Traditional Haiku consists of three lines. The first line typically has five syllables, the second line has seven syllables, and the third line has five syllables. However, in English Haiku, the number of syllables per line can vary as long as the overall feel is similar to the typical 5-7-5 structure.\n\n3. Theme: Haiku focuses on nature or the seasons, evoking a specific image or feeling. It's a brief snapshot of a moment, usually about the natural world.\n\n4. Tone and Mood: Haiku can be happy, melancholic, surprised, or questioning. The beauty of a Haiku is in its simplicity and directness.\n\nHere's an example of a famous Haiku by Matsuo Basho:\n\nFrost upon my sleeves\nThe nightingale, too, has vanished \u2013\nThe silver deep.\n\nLet's try writing a Haiku together:\n\n1. Choose a topic related to nature or the seasons: Summer evening (We'll stick with the traditional theme for now)\n\n2. Write the first line with a brief description of the scene or image:\n   - \"Buzzing cicadas fill (5 syllables)\"\n\n3. Write the second line, which should expand upon the scene or image, and add another layer of detail or feeling:\n   - \"The evening's gentle warmth (7 syllables)\"\n\n4. Write the final line, which should create a sudden shift or serve as a surprising conclusion:\n   - \"And the stars begin to twinkle (5 syllables)\"\n\nYour final Haiku:\n\nBuzzing cicadas fill\nThe evening's gentle warmth\nAnd the stars begin to twinkle\n\nDid you enjoy this introduction to Haiku? Let me know if you have any questions about Haiku, or if you need help writing more!

Choose a season or a natural setting, like a moonlight, cherry blossoms, or autumn leaves.\n2. Think of an action, emotion, or image associated with it.\n3.

In Python, when a lambda function captures variables from its surrounding scope, a reference to that variable is stored, not the actual value.\n\nWhen the lambda functions are defined, the `value` variable in the `main` function does not have a value yet, so each lambda function captures the variable `value` as a reference to an undefined variable.

One possible solution is to pass a separate function that fetches the current value in the `main` function and use it as an argument to the lambda functions:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    value = 10\n    operands = [2, 10, 14, 8]\n    lambdas = build_lambdas(operands, get_value(value))\n\n    for l in lambdas:\n        print(l())\n\ndef get_value(value):\n    return lambda: value\n\ndef build_lambdas(operands, get_value_func):\n    lambdas = []\n    for operand in operands:\n        lmbd = lambda: get_value_func() * operand\n        lambdas.append(lmbd)\n    return lambdas\n\nmain()\n```\n\nWith this fix, the output will be:\n\n```\n20\n100\n140\n80\n```", "shortest_response": "The output of this program will be a series of numbers, each one representing the result of multiplying the given value (10, in this case) by one of the operands.

Significance of New Knowledge\n   - The outcome of this research can be utilized to enhance system efficiency in areas like e-commerce, data management, and search engine optimization.\n   - The time saved and reduction in resource usage will contribute to an improvement in user experience, promoting faster service delivery.\n   - The lessons learned from the development of optimized algorithms can serve as a foundation for further research in efficient algorithm design and computer science.", "input_size": 92, "output_sizes": [579, 495, 549, 483, 663, 531, 656, 699, 704, 510], "output_mean": 586.9, "output_std": 81.62, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 515.25, "p50": 564.0, "p75": 661.25, "p99": 703.55}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 16.78777}, {"sample_id": "d76c804798238260", "prompt_id": "9311a07c7aa9a40d", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "i need to use Wistia Uploader in angular 14", "longest_response": "To use Wistia Uploader in an Angular 14 project, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Install Angular CLI: If you haven't already, install the Angular CLI by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @angular/cli\n```\n\n2. Create a new Angular project:\n\n```bash\nng new my-app\n```\n\nReplace `my-app` with the desired name for your Angular project.\n\n3. Navigate to the project directory:\n\n```bash\ncd my-app\n```\n\n4. Install Wistia Uploader:\n\nSince Angular 14 doesn't officially support, we'll use Angular 12 to install Wistia Uploader:\n\n```bash\nng add @nguniversal/express-engine@8.1.6\nng add @nguniversal/module-map-ngfactory-loader@8.1.6\nng add web-components-wrapper\nnpm install wistia-uploader\n```\n\n5. Add Wistia Uploader to the `styles.css`:\n\n```css\n@import '~wistia-uploader/dist/index.css';\n```\n\n6. Add Wistia Uploader to the `app.module.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { WistiaUploaderModule } from 'wistia-uploader';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    // ... Other imports\n    WistiaUploaderModule,\n  ],\n  // ... Other component declarations\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\n\n7. Import and use Wistia Uploader in a component:\n\nCreate a new component (if not already created), and import the Wistia Uploader in it:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport * as Wistia from 'wistia-uploader';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-upload',\n  templateUrl: './upload.component.html',\n})\nexport class UploadComponent {\n  uploader: any;\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n    this.initUploader();\n  }\n\n  initUploader() {\n    this.uploader = new Wistia.Uploader('YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID', {\n      file: '/path/to/your/file.mp4',\n      multiple: false,\n      options: {\n        // Additional options can be provided here\n      },\n      callbacks: {\n        // Callbacks for responding to various events\n      },\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUpdate the `templateUrl` property in the component decorator to point to the HTML template for the new component.\n\n8. Update the AppModule to register the uploader component:\n\n```typescript\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, UploadComponent],\n  imports: [\n    // ... Other imports\n    RouterModule.forRoot(routes),\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\n\n9.

He then uses the examples of Isaac and Ishmael, and Jacob and Esau, to illustrate that God's choices are not based on human effort or merit, but on His sovereign will.\n\nPaul continues by describing how even though the physical descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were given the law and the promises, it is not those who are physically descendants who are the children of God, but those who are the children of the promise.\n\nHe uses the example of Pharaoh to show that God hardens and softens hearts according to His own purposes, which Paul says is a matter of great mystery.\n\nIn the latter part of the chapter, Paul discusses the concept of reprobation, stating that it is not as though God's word has failed. For if all of Israel were determined by human resolve, God's purpose and grace would be nullified.\n\nPaul then expresses his struggle to understand God's ways, but affirms that he is content with God's sovereign choices, as he is convinced that God's judgement is just.\n\nIn summary, Chapter 9 of Romans is a profound exploration of God's sovereignty in election, using biblical examples to illustrate God's choices are not based on human merit, but His sovereign will.

He also discusses the concept of predestination, stating that those whom God has called, He will justify.\n\nHowever, Paul is careful to emphasize that this does not eliminate human responsibility.

This particular change goes deeper than many\nothers and touches on all aspects of a person\u2019s life. The following sections offer a\nvery general outline of the recovery pattern that I have observed and facilitated in\nclients:\n12\n1. Separation\n2. Confusion\n3. Avoidance\n4. Feeling\n5. Rebuilding\nThese are not discrete stages in the formal sense. There is considerable overlap\nbetween them and a person may be in more than one phase at a time. However, the\noverall pattern may help you understand where you have been, where you are now,\nand what you can expect in the future.\nPhase 1: Separation\nBefore leaving, there is usually comfort from being \"in the fold.\" Whether you were\nraised in the church or joined later, there was a time when things were at least okay.\nSome people report great satisfaction when describing their religious participation:\nvalues were affirmed and emotional needs were met; their belief system felt\nintellectually congruent. Other people describe less identification or less intense\ninvolvement, but some contentment nonetheless.\nBut then questions and doubts arise, perhaps gradually. Bits of new information\nbecome harder to integrate and new life experiences do not fit with standard dogma.\nIt can feel unsettling when it seems that promises are not being fulfilled or that\nunexpected problems are occurring. That is, there are fewer pluses and more\nminuses. Your faith feels like a tapestry coming apart.\nMany believers strive to continue being faithful, using denial, rationalization, or\ngreater effort to be \"victorious Christians,\" for example. Finally, it just becomes too\nmuch. Some people will make a sudden break, perhaps after a \"last straw\"\nexperience. Others will struggle for a long time and only gradually let go. In trying to\nmake sense of your doubts and fears, you might try to get help from church leaders,\nonly to find that they don't want to hear you; it triggers their own fears. Over time,\nyou may notice your attendance at church dropping; you might experiment with\nother churches, read the Bible less, pray less, and finally come to view yourself\ndifferently any longer as a member of the \"body.\" The leaving can range from the\ntraumatic to what seems relatively easy. Nonetheless, deep changes are occurring.\nPhase 2: Confusion\nWhether sudden or gradual, breaking away usually creates a state of serious\nconfusion. This can be a major upheaval because your religion essentially defined\nyour entire structure of reality and your old definitions no longer hold. Notions of\nwho you were, your purpose in life, your relationship to others; needed explanations\nabout the world; interpretations of the past; expectations for the future; and\ndirections about how to feel, think, make decisions, and lead your life have been\nlost. Letting go of such a massive structure can leave you feeling totally adrift. The\nsense of existential angst can be intense as you struggle to get a new foothold on\nlife. You are starting over from scratch on all the basic questions about life. Many\npeople in this phase feel like a naive child in an adult world.\nMoreover, the fears instilled by the religion itself can produce additional anxiety. You\nwere taught that if you did not believe you would go to hell. So it makes great sense\nif you have been nervous and scared about leaving. There may be times of near\n13\npanic, when you wonder whether you've made a terrible mistake and will be forever\ndamned. You might have trouble with intense feelings in this phase because you\nhave been taught to interpret them as \"conviction of the Holy Spirit.\" Sometimes\npeople in this phase wonder if it wouldn\u2019t be simpler and safer to just \"get right with\nGod,\" and return to church. However, such returns rarely last.\nBut the experience of leaving can also be liberating, like breaking out of prison. If\nyou feel oppressed by all the formulas and judgments, the rules and regulations, you\nmight now feel a great relief, able to think and feel and experience much more of\nyourself. Some people describe a wonderful, almost euphoric, feeling of \"coming\nhome\" when they settle in to the notion of just being alive and living life now, in this\nworld. They see the world as a friendly place for a change, like a newly discovered\ncandy store, with so much to offer. There can be a glorious excitement about taking\ncharge of your own life.\nSince leaving, I've changed how I think. I was stuck in a dualistic way\nof thinking. My world now seems filled with infinite possibilities. When\nI first left the church, I felt this weight being lifted from my shoulders.\nFreedom to be me is probably the most positive benefit.\n\u2014Richard\nPhase 3: Avoidance\nThe next phase amounts to a kind of moratorium on religion and spirituality. Many\npeople do not attend any church whatsoever and do not want to even discuss the\nconcept of a God. They want to distance themselves from church to deny previous\ninvolvement.\nThose who feel they have been abused by their religious experiences may also avoid\nany contact with church members or even church buildings. A number of people have\ntrouble participating in organizations of other kinds as well, in political or social\ngroups, for example. These patterns of avoidance and numbness seem to be\nmethods of self-protection. From the perspective of an outside observer, this phase\nmay look like \"throwing the baby out with the bathwater,\" but it appears to be an\nessential part of the recovery process. To make a real break, you need to call a halt\nto life, as you once knew it and create some space and new direction for yourself.\nPhase 4: Feeling\nAfter a while, intense but mixed feelings tend to emerge. This can be a chaotic\nperiod. Most people experience some amount of anger. You might feel like an angry\nchild losing Santa Claus. In thinking over the time spent being faithful, there can be\nrage over the damage done-life lost, negative self-image, ignorance about the world\nand real life, guilt and suffering, denial of pleasures, missing skills, hurt\nrelationships, spoiled careers. If you have parents who used religion to justify severe\ndiscipline, or if you suffered actual abuse at the hands of church leaders, you could\nbe very angry.\nWhile some people find ways to express themselves during this phase, most wonder\nwhat to do with all their anger. Because of what you've been taught, you might think\nthat you should simply forgive and forget rather than accept these feelings as\nlegitimate. The rage may then go underground and stay with you. Bottled up\nemotions like these can leave you feeling hopeless, helpless, anxious, and\ndepressed.\n14\nAs you progress out of the avoidance phase, the other major feeling you wills likely\nexperience is grief. You really have had multiple losses. Uncovering and grieving\nthese losses will be key to releasing you from your pain. This process is akin to\nrecovering from the death of a loved one. As described by Carol Staudacher (1987),\nthis usually includes shock, disorganization, and reorganization. The loss of\nrelationship with God can feel devastating, as though your parents have died; you no\nlonger have a Heavenly Father. If you were deeply involved in a personal relationship\nwith Jesus, you have also lost a best friend and lover. Added to this is the guilt of\nleaving and fears about what you did to cause the breakup. You might also be afraid\nthat no one else will ever love you like that again. Yet going back seems impossible,\nand that makes the whole process all the more agonizing.\nPhase 5: Rebuilding\nFortunately healing can occur. You can work through your pain and allow your inner\nstrengths to emerge. In the rebuilding phase, people re-discover their self-worth.\nThey rejoin life on a different basis. Perceptions and beliefs are reconstructed. You\ntoo can find new principles to live by and new meaning for your life. Some of your\nvalues may remain the same, but you sort through what you have been taught and\nkeep what is valuable.\nYou learn anew to do things from choice. As you rebuild your sense of self, you\nbecome clearer about who you really are. You can respect your own thoughts and\nfeelings and make decisions more confidently. For example, you might still believe\nthat \"love one another\" is an important guideline for your life. On the other hand,\n\"be here now\" might also become important to you, and different from what you\nhave been taught.\nAs you exercise your freedom and ability to create your own life, a sense of\nempowerment evolves that can feel exhilarating. You can now take full responsibility\nfor yourself and enjoy the process. Your confidence grows as you address the many\nareas of life that need your creative energy-career, family, friendships, finances,\nrecreation, and so on. You will need to rebuild your social network. Personal\nrelationships will be different in important ways. You might want a new place for\nspirituality in your life. Your approach to parenting your own children may need to be\nrethought.", "longest_response": "You've provided a comprehensive and insightful outline of the phases people often go through when recovering from a rigid religion. These phases are not linear and can overlap, but they help understand the process and expectations:\n\n1. Separation: This phase represents the initial breaking away from the religious belief system. It can involve feelings of comfort, gradual or sudden questioning, doubts, and a sense of promised fulfillments not being met. The struggle to make sense of these doubts may prompt people to seek help from church leaders, but they might find that their concerns are not addressed. Eventually, the person might end their identification as a member of the religious group and experience deep changes.\n\n2. Confusion: After leaving the religion, there is often a state of confusion due to a loss of previous definitions of reality, purpose, and structure. This phase can be marked by feelings of existential angst, anxiety, and fear of hell, as well as a sense of liberation, relief, and excitement about taking control of one's own life. Some people may struggle to reconcile newfound freedom with feelings of guilt and self-doubt.\n\n3. Avoidance: This phase is characterized by avoiding religious and spiritual activities or discussions. This avoidance can be a form of self-protection as the individual attempts to separate themselves from their past religious experiences. Some may also avoid social or political groups as they process their religious transition.\n\n4. Feeling: During this phase, intense, mixed feelings such as anger, grief, and guilt may emerge. People may experience anger about the damage caused by religious teachings, guilt about leaving, and grief over multiple losses such as relationships with God, religious figures, and communities. This phase can be chaotic as the individual processes these feelings and begins to heal.\n\n5. Rebuilding: In the final phase, people rebuild their lives based on new principles and values. They rediscover their self-worth, become clearer about their identity, and learn to make decisions confidently. This process can lead to a sense of empowerment as the individual takes responsibility for their life and enjoys the process of personal growth and discovery.\n\nThese phases can vary greatly in duration and intensity, and it's important to remember that everyone's journey is unique.

A large, luminous sphere, it captured the nation's attention and stirred a whirlwind of speculation. The US government, suspecting it to be a Chinese spy balloon, scrambled to counter this unprecedented threat.\n\nMeanwhile, in Beijing, the Chinese government watched the global drama unfold with a mixture of anxiety and curiosity. Within the towering walls of the Great Hall of the People, the Chinese President, Zhang Li, gathered his closest advisors to discuss their next move.\n\nZhang Li, a man of vision and wisdom, had always envisioned a harmonious world where nations collaborated rather than competed. He realized the potential of this incident to escalate tensions and sought a solution that would not compromise his vision.\n\nSimultaneously, in Washington D.C., President Samuel Johnson, a man of diplomacy, recognized the need for communication and understanding. He agreed that an escalation was not in anyone's best interest and decided to send a message of peace to the Chinese government, proposing a summit to address the issue.\n\nIn Beijing, Zhang Li and his advisors pondered over the proposal. Their discussions were marked by long pauses and heated debates, but eventually, they reached a consensus. Zhang Li would accept the invitation, but on one condition: the summit would serve as a platform to discuss broader issues that plagued the US-China relations, with the ultimate goal of fostering a deeper partnership.\n\nAs the day of the summit approached, the air was thick with anticipation. The world watched, holding its breath, wondering if these two superpowers would find a path to cooperation or continue on their collision course.\n\nThe two leaders, standing against the backdrop of the White House, delivered their impassioned speeches, echoing the need for understanding, respect, and cooperation. They set aside their differences and began a series of discussions aimed at resolving various contentious issues, including trade, climate change, and security.\n\nOn the third day, while working tirelessly to find solutions, the Chinese spy balloon came into view, its presence a stark reminder of the reasons they had gathered. Johnson and Zhang Li called for an immediate joint investigation to determine the balloon's origin and purpose. The findings revealed a misunderstanding that had stemmed from a misinterpretation of data transmitted by the balloon.\n\nIn the face of this revelation, the two leaders decided to turn a potential crisis into an opportunity. They pledged to strengthen their cooperation, ensuring such incidents would not happen again, and agreed to share intelligence more freely to prevent future misunderstandings.\n\nAs the sun set on the historic summit, the world watched as the two leaders shook hands, symbolizing a new era of cooperation between the United States and China. The Chinese spy balloon, initially a symbol of tension, had brought these two nations closer together, demonstrating that even the strangest of encounters could lead to a harmonious future.\n\nThe days that followed were marked by increased collaboration and the signing of important agreements addressing climate change, nuclear non-proliferation, and cybersecurity. The US-China relationship, once fraught with conflict, was now a beacon of hope, setting an example for other nations to follow.\n\nAnd so, amidst the vast expanse of the sky, a single Chinese spy balloon brought about a transformation, teaching us that even the most unexpected circumstances can lead to remarkable alliances.

Amidst the tension, they found common ground in curiosity and a shared desire for knowledge.\n\nThe days turned into weeks, and finally, they succeeded. The advanced sensors within Wenling were revealed to be an ingenious solution for monitoring climate change and predicting natural disasters. In the spirit of cooperation, President Thompson and President Li announced a new era of partnership, pledging to share this technology globally.\n\nFrom that day forward, the U.S. and China worked together to combat climate change and help nations at risk of natural disasters.

This concept is central to the Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) design patterns.\n\nIn Spring, the core idea of DI is to invert the control of object creation and the passing of dependencies from the code toSpring's IoC container (or Spring Application Context). The benefits of using DI and IoC provided by Spring include:\n\n1. Improved modularity: Components are loosely coupled, making them easier to modify and test independently.\n2. Reduced boilerplate code: Spring takes care of dependency creation and management, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.\n3. Improved testability: As DI separates the classes responsible for performing operations and managing dependencies, the components can be easily mocked or stubbed during tests.\n4. Enhanced reusability: Dependencies can be shared across different classes or components, promoting code reusability.\n\nHere's a simple example of how Dependency Injection works in Spring Framework:\n\n```java\n// A Service interface\npublic interface GreetingService{\n  String sayGreeting();\n}\n\n// An implementation of the GreetingService interface\n@Service\npublic class EnglishGreetingService implements GreetingService {\n  @Override\n  public String sayGreeting() {\n    return \"Hello, World!\";\n  }\n}\n\n// A MessagePrinter interface\npublic interface MessagePrinter {\n  void printMessage(String message);\n}\n\n// A ConsoleMessagePrinter class\n@Component\npublic class ConsoleMessagePrinter implements MessagePrinter {\n  @Override\n  public void printMessage(String message) {\n    System.out.println(message);\n  }\n}\n\n// A Service that uses the GreetingService and MessagePrinter\n@Service\npublic class GreetingServiceUsage {\n  private final GreetingService greetingService;\n  private final MessagePrinter messagePrinter;\n\n  // Spring will inject these dependencies.\n  public GreetingServiceUsage(GreetingService greetingService, MessagePrinter messagePrinter) {\n    this.greetingService = greetingService;\n    this.messagePrinter = messagePrinter;\n  }\n\n  public void printGreeting() {\n    String greeting = greetingService.sayGreeting();\n    messagePrinter.printMessage(greeting);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `GreetingServiceUsage` class relies on an implementation of the `GreetingService` interface and `MessagePrinter` interface. Instead of creating these dependencies explicitly within the class, Spring is responsible for injecting the instances at runtime using an Application Context or IoC container. This allows Spring to manage the lifecycle of the dependencies, and the `GreetingServiceUsage` class does not need to worry about creating or configuring the dependencies.", "shortest_response": "Dependency in the context of software development refers to a situation where a class or module relies on another class or module to fulfill its functionality. In other words, the first class or module \"depends\" on the second one. The concept of Dependency Injection (DI) comes into play to manage these dependencies, especially in a complex application.\n\nNow, let's talk about how Dependency Injection works in the Spring Framework:\n\n1. **Components and Dependencies**: You define Spring-managed components in a configuration file ( traditionally an XML file, but nowadays, Java-based annotations like @Component, @Service, @Repository and @Controller are commonly used). Components have dependencies on other components.\n\n2. **Dependency Injection**: Instead of components creating their own dependencies (a process known as New Instantiation), Spring Framework does this for them. When a component is needed, Spring Framework creates the component and injects (or sets) the dependencies into the component.\n\n3. **Control Over Dependencies**: This enables you to control the lifecycle of your dependencies and also allows for better testability, as you can simulate various scenarios with mocked or test versions of the dependencies.\n\n4. **Types of Dependency Injection**: Spring Framework supports three types of Dependency Injection: Constructor-based, Setter-based, and Interface-based (also known as Method-based). The preferred method is Constructor-based injection, as it ensures the dependency is set before the object is used.\n\n5. **IoC Container**: The core of the Spring Framework is an Inversion of Control (IoC) container, which is responsible for managing the components and their dependencies. The IoC container controls when & how objects are created and their dependencies are set.", "input_size": 16, "output_sizes": [430, 518, 495, 459, 667, 597, 392, 430, 391, 516], "output_mean": 489.5, "output_std": 84.75, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 430.0, "p50": 477.0, "p75": 517.5, "p99": 660.7}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 15.21473}, {"sample_id": "0d3edd323a880a0b", "prompt_id": "1cc660b740ff61e3", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Here is some more information.

Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction capitalizeFirstLetter(str) {\n  return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);\n}\n\n// Usage\nconsole.log(capitalizeFirstLetter(\"example\")); // Output: \"Example\"\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also use `replace()` method along with a regular expression to capitalize the first letter:\n\n```javascript\nfunction capitalizeFirstLetter(str) {\n  return str.replace(/^\\w/, letter => letter.toUpperCase());\n}\n\n// Usage\nconsole.log(capitalizeFirstLetter(\"example\")); // Output: \"Example\"\n```\n\nKeep in mind that this solution only works when the input string contains at least one word. If your string consists of multiple words and you want to capitalize every first letter of each word, you might consider using a library like underscore.js or lodash.js, which offers a `capitalize` function.\n\nFor example, using lodash:\n\n```javascript\nconst _ = require('lodash');\n\nconsole.log(_([\"foo bar\", \"baz\"]).map(_.capitalize).value());\n// Output: [\"Foo Bar\", \"Baz\"]\n```", "shortest_response": "In JavaScript, you can convert the first letter of a string to uppercase using the `charAt()` method in combination with `toUpperCase()`.

Relational DBMS (RDBMS)**\n\n- Definition: RDBMS is a database management system based on the relational model, which stores data in tables with a defined structure (relationships between tables using keys).\n\n- Advantages:\n  a. Easy data management: RDBMS allows for better organization and manipulation of large amounts of structured data.\n  b. Standardized query language (SQL): SQL enables users to easily design, create, maintain, and manipulate databases.\n  c. Data integrity: RDBMS enforces data consistency through constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and referential integrity.\n\n- examples: Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL\n- Applications: RDBMS is widely used in various industries, such as banking, healthcare, retail, and manufacturing, for managing transactions, analyzing data, and supporting decision-making processes.\n\n**2. NoSQL DBMS**\n\n- Definition: NoSQL (Not Only SQL) DBMS are non-relational database management systems that offer increased scalability and flexibility over traditional RDBMS for storing and managing unstructured, semi-structured, and big data.\n\n- Advantages:\n  a. Scalability: NoSQL databases can handle an enormous amount of data and scale horizontally across multiple servers.\n  b. Flexibility: NoSQL databases offer schemaless data models, making it easier to evolve and adapt data as business requirements change.\n  c. Performance: NoSQL databases can offer excellent read and write performance, making them ideal for real-time, high-throughput applications.\n\n- examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, and Redis\n- Applications: NoSQL is widely used in web applications, real-time analytics, graph databases, and IoT (Internet of Things) applications that require high scalability and data flexibility.\n\n**3. Hybrid DBMS**\n\n- Definition: Hybrid DBMS (also known as NewSQL) combines the advantages of RDBMS and NoSQL databases by offering high performance, scalability, and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance.\n\n- Advantages:\n  a. High performance: Hybrid DBMS can handle high transactional loads and offer low latency with ACID compliance.\n  b. Scalability: Hybrid DBMS can scale horizontally across multiple servers while maintaining ACID compliance.\n  c. Flexibility: Hybrid DBMS can support both structured and unstructured data.\n\n- examples: CockroachDB, TitanDB, and ScaleDB\n- Applications: Hybrid DBMS is suitable for high-performance, large-scale web applications, real-time analytical processing, and IoT applications that demand both ACID compliance and scalability.\n\n**4. Object-Oriented DBMS (OODBMS)**\n\n- Definition: OODBMS stores data in the form of objects, which are instances of classes. Each object contains both a data structure and a behavior.\n\n- Advantages:\n  a. Better data modeling: OODBMS supports complex relationships and data hierarchies that cannot be represented effectively in relational databases.\n  b. Polymorphism and inheritance: OODBMS can easily handle polymorphism, meaning an object can take on many forms, and inheritance, meaning objects can inherit properties from other objects.\n  c. Object-oriented programming languages: OODBMS integrates well with object-oriented programming languages like Java, C++, and Python.\n\n- examples: GemStone, ObjectDB, and DB4O\n- Applications: OODBMS is primarily used in environments where complex data relationships and object manipulation are required, such as GIS (Geographic Information System), financial analysis, and gaming applications.\n\n**5. Document-Oriented DBMS**\n\n- Definition: Document-oriented databases store data as self-contained documents with a scheme-less or semi-structured data model.\n\n- Advantages:\n  a. Flexibility: Document-oriented databases can store and manage both structured and semi-structured data with ease.\n  b. Scalability: Document-oriented databases use sharding and replication to provide high scalability and performance.\n  c. Native JSON and BSON support: Document-oriented databases natively support JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and BSON (a binary version of JSON), making it easy to manipulate data stored in documents.\n\n- examples: MongoDB, RavenDB, and Couchbase\n- Applications: Document-oriented databases are ideally suited for web applications, content management systems, and mobile applications where data needs to be stored, retrieved, and manipulated in flexible and dynamic ways.\n\nIn conclusion, the choice of DBMS for an organization depends on various factors, such as the nature of the data, scalability requirements, performance needs, and development environment. By understanding the advantages and applications of different DBMS, organizations can make informed decisions to support their strategic goals and achieve greater operational efficiency.\n\n[IT for Managers] [Database Management Systems] [RDBMS] [NoSQL] [Hybrid DBMS] [OODBMS] [Document-Oriented DBMS] [Oracle] [MySQL] [SQL Server] [PostgreSQL] [MongoDB] [Cassandra] [CouchDB] [Redis] [CockroachDB] [TitanDB] [ScaleDB] [GemStone] [ObjectDB] [DB4O] [GIS] [financial analysis] [gaming applications] [web applications] [content management systems] [mobile applications]", "shortest_response": "Title: Comparative Analysis of Database Management Systems (DBMS) for IT Managers\n\n1. **Relational DBMS (RDBMS):**\n   - Description: A system that organizes data into tables that consist of rows and columns, enforcing relationships between the tables.

The deceitful acts of Medusa have led to a chain of events that culminated in the tragic deaths of Maka Albarn and Soul Eater, two beloved figures from the Death Weapon Meister Academy (DWMA).\n\nAs the news of Medusa's involvement spreads, a wave of outrage and condemnation sweeps across the Witch community. The dissolution of Ukraine and the loss of valuable allies from the DWMA, notably Feodor and the Death Scythe Tsar Pushka, weigh heavy on the hearts of many. The community is forced to confront the reality that one of their own has chosen a path of darkness, and their actions have jeopardized the future of Witches and Meisters alike.\n\nCommunity leaders and elders gather to discuss the matter, attempting to find a way to make amends for the damage done. Some advocate for increased transparency and collaboration with the DWMA, seeking to repair the fractured relationship. Others call for the establishment of a Witch tribunal to investigate and punish those who act against the best interests of the community.\n\nAmidst the chaos, there are those who defend Medusa, citing her past contributions and insisting that she was misunderstood. However, these voices are few and far between, increasingly drowned out by the cries for justice.\n\nOne by one, Witches publicly denounce Medusa, distancing themselves from her actions and expressing sympathy for those affected by her misdeeds. It is a painful time for the community, as they grapple with the reality of the darkness that exists within their own ranks. But in this moment of pain, there is also a glimmer of hope, as the Witch community begins to take responsibility for its own actions and seek a path toward reconciliation with the DWMA.\n\nThe condemnation of Medusa Gorgon by her own community marks a turning point in the history of Witches and Meisters. From this moment on, they face a new challenge: to prove to the world that they are not the monsters they have been portrayed as and to build a future where Witches and Meisters can coexist peacefully. It will be a long and difficult road, but the Witches of this alternate universe have taken the first step on that journey, vowing never to let the darkness that was Medusa fester and grow once more.", "shortest_response": "In this alternate universe, the Witch community expresses fierce condemnation toward the late Medusa Gorgon, who was responsible for the summoning of the Kishin Asura and the death of Maka and Soul. The public denouncement is prompted by Medusa's wicked actions, particularly her extreme abuse of her child, Crona, and use of them as a tool for summoning the Kishin.\n\nMedusa's actions, such as ordering Crona to unleash the powerful Mad Blood that destroyed Kyiv and dissolved Ukraine, and the dissolution of the Russian DWMA, Feodor and the Death Scythe Tsar Pushka, fuel the community's strong rejection of Medusa. They see her as a traitor to not only her own kind but also to humanity for causing so much destruction and loss.\n\nThe Witch community's reaction to Medusa becomes a significant factor in their ongoing estrangement from the DWMA, emphasizing the difficult path toward true reconciliation and understanding between the two groups.

For a crowd and Lena's face, the isopreference curves might differ due to the inherent features of the images. Lena's face, being a high-frequency, detailed, and textured image, may have a higher preference for high-contrast isopreference curves, considering the human eye's propensity for recognizing and identifying facial features. In contrast, a crowd image, featuring lower-frequency and coarser details, may have a higher preference for low-contrast isopreference curves, as the human visual system is more tolerant of lower contrast and noise in less-detailed areas.\n\n(b) In the degradation model, the assumption for the degradation function is that it describes the process by which an original image (e.g., a pristine photograph) is transformed into a degraded image (e.g., a noisy or blurred photograph) due to causes like imaging sensors, transmission, or storage errors. The added noise in the model usually represents unwanted random fluctuations in the image's pixel values, often modeled as Gaussian or salt-and-pepper noise.\n\n(c) Band filters and notch filters are both types of frequency selective filters, but they target different ranges of frequencies. Band filters allow passbands of frequencies to pass through unaltered while attenuating the rest (except for potentially a small stopband around the filter's center frequency). Notch filters, on the other hand, selectively attenuate a narrow band of frequencies (the notch) while allowing the rest of the frequencies to pass through unaltered.\n\n(d) Ringing effect, also known as overshoot or undershoot, occurs when the output of an ideal filter (like a step, impulse, or ideal low-pass filter) exhibits temporary oscillations (overshoot or undershoot) around the steady-state output before settling to the final value. These oscillations are caused by the filter's attempt to mimic the discontinuities or sharp transitions in the input signal using a continuous mathematical function. The ringing effect can result in undesirable artifacts in the filtered signal, due to the overshoot or undershoot of the filter's output.\n\n(e) To determine the direction of motion from an image degraded by uniform-linear motion blurring, one can use optical flow estimation techniques, such as the Lucas-Kanade method or the Horn-Schunck method. These techniques estimate the motion of image features by comparing the brightness or intensity values at corresponding points in neighboring frames, assuming that the brightness of a point in the image remains constant while it moves. By analyzing the displacement vectors of these image features, one can infer the direction and magnitude of the motion that caused the blurring in the first place.", "shortest_response": "I'll provide concise responses for the questions requested, each limited to the specified 5% scope:\n\n(a) Isopreference curves refer to how people subjectively perceive image quality. While preferences can vary, a study might show that a crowd image, rich in complex patterns and movement, is preferred at higher levels of distortion or noise compared to a high-fidelity image like Lena's face, which is more reliant on sharp details for perceived quality.\n\n(b) In a degradation model, the degradation function represents the process of image degradation (e.g., blurring, noise addition) from a high-quality reference image to a degraded one. The assumption is that the degradation process is deterministic, meaning it consistently affects the image in the same way when repeated. Added noise is usually modeled as independent, zero-mean, identically distributed random variables.\n\n(c) A band-pass filter allows for the passage of frequency components within a specified range, typically centered around a cutoff frequency. This is often used to emphasize certain details while reducing low- or high-frequency noise. In contrast, a notch filter is designed to attenuate a specific narrow range of frequencies, typically used for suppressing undesirable frequency components.\n\n(d) The ringing effect, also known as Gibbs phenomena, occurs when an ideal filter (one with infinite bandwidth and sharp cutoff) is applied to a function containing sudden changes or discontinuities. The filter overshoots and undershoots these regions, resulting in oscillations, i.e., ringing, around the discontinuities.\n\n(e) To determine the direction of motion from an image degraded by uniform-linear motion blurring, one can analyze the distortion pattern created by the blur. The distortion is typically more significant across the direction perpendicular to the motion, creating horizontal and vertical streaks in the image. By analyzing the orientation and distribution of these streaks, the direction of motion can be inferred.", "input_size": 122, "output_sizes": [458, 579, 637, 502, 554, 631, 605, 494, 442, 550], "output_mean": 545.2, "output_std": 65.84, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 496.0, "p50": 552.0, "p75": 598.5, "p99": 636.46}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 15.13075}, {"sample_id": "0ec55a206db5505b", "prompt_id": "2939d1ecf3353841", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "If keywords were relevant, what keywords be more beneficial?", "longest_response": "To optimize content for SEO (Search Engine Optimization), it's essential to focus on relevant keywords that accurately describe the content and are sought after by potential readers.

This will help attract visitors who are genuinely interested in your offerings.\n2. Search Volume: Look for keywords that are frequently searched for by internet users. You can use tools like Google Keyword Planner to find popular search terms.\n3. Competition: Choose keywords with relatively low competition. This means there are fewer websites competing for the same keyword. Low competition keywords may be easier to rank for organically.\n4. Intent: Choose keywords that indicate a user's intent. For example, a user searching for \"best electric toothbrushes\" may be in the research phase and may be more likely to convert than a user searching for \"electric toothbrush.\"\n5. Long-tail keywords: Long-tail keywords are longer, more specific phrases that tend to have lower competition and higher intent. For example, instead of \"toothbrush,\" a long-tail keyword could be \"best electric toothbrush for sensitive teeth.\"\n\nOverall, choose keywords that are relevant to your audience, have a high search volume, low competition, and indicate a high intent to convert.", "input_size": 14, "output_sizes": [373, 420, 445, 439, 296, 397, 507, 323, 430, 497], "output_mean": 412.7, "output_std": 64.48, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 379.0, "p50": 425.0, "p75": 443.5, "p99": 506.1}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 11.10335}, {"sample_id": "9ddf586087271212", "prompt_id": "12c256974c537005", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "$(document).ready(function () {\n $(\"#create-post-form\").submit(function (e) {\n e.preventDefault();\n var dvdTitle = $(\"#dvdTitle\").val();\n var maxPrice = $(\"#maxPrice\").val();\n var category = $(\"#exampleSelect\").val();\n\n \n\n if (maxPrice == \"\" && category == null) {\n\n $.ajax({\n type: \"GET\",\n url: \"http://localhost:8081/filmtitle\",\n data: {\n dvdTitle: dvdTitle,\n\n },\n success: function (data) {\n sessionStorage.setItem(\"searchResults\", JSON.stringify(data));\n window.location.assign(\"searchResults.html\");\n\n // Open a new page with the search results\n //window.open(\"results.php?data=\" + data, \"\\_blank\");\n }\n });\n\n }\n\n else {\n $.ajax({\n type: \"GET\",\n url: \"http://localhost:8081/categoryname\",\n data: {\n dvdTitle: dvdTitle,\n maxPrice: maxPrice,\n category: category\n },\n success: function (data) {\n sessionStorage.setItem(\"searchResults\", JSON.stringify(data));\n window.location.assign(\"searchResults.html\");\n\n // Open a new page with the search results\n //window.open(\"results.php?data=\" + data, \"\\_blank\");\n }\n });\n }\n });\n });\n\ngiven the code above and the code given below\nSearch for DVD title:\n\nMax Price:\n\nSelect Category\n\nSearch\nHow do I show an error message dvdTitle is empty and category is null?", "longest_response": "To show an error message when `dvdTitle` is empty and `category` is null, you can add an if statement within the else block and display a message using JavaScript's `alert()` function or create your own error div.

I've also added a `displayError()` function to create the error div and update its content.

Here it is that: \u201cJesus proclaimed the Kingdom of God; a new and definitive intervention by God, with a transforming power equal and even superior to his creation of the world\u201d (GDC 101). First of all I just want to know if you have ever heard a more potent and powerful expression of the Kingdom of God, \u201cwith a transforming power equal and even superior to his creation of the world.\u201d As you know salvation is the central message of the good news. \u201cThis is the great gift of God which is to be considered as comprising not merely liberation from all those things by which man is oppressed, but especially liberation from sin and from the domination of the evil one, a liberation which incorporates that gladness enjoyed by every man who knows God and is known by him, who sees God and who surrenders himself trustingly to him.\u201d This is a good beginning point for what might discuss what would be an \u201cintimate and vital bond of man to God,\u201d so that is a starting point of departure and the scope of our conversion because not all people believe even in this very brief and limited view of the Gospel message proclaiming salvation which is liberation, but also an intimate relationship with God.\n\nAccording to the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Here are at least five reasons why the Gospel might be forgotten, overlooked or even explicitly rejected. I want to know in the comments below if one or more of these attunes might apply to you or may have been your perspective before you believed.\n\nRevolt against evil in the world\nReligious ignorance or indifference\nThe cares and riches of this world\nThe scandal of bad example on the part of believers\nCurrents of thought hostile to religion \nFinally, that attitude of sinful man which makes him hide from God out of fear and flee his call.\n(CCC 29)\n\nLet me know if you are a believer and have ever once identified with one of these six reasons. If you do not believe does one of these six reasons apply to you and if so, which one. Pause, the video and go in the comments and let me know your thoughts. Take a moment to consider which one applies to you then we will discuss a passage from Scriptures and get your thoughts on that. First, of these six just pick one and let me know which one you think most applies to you now or at one time in your life may have been a reason for not believing in the proclamation without getting into any other reasons which one of these do you think relates to you the most. I would actually say after thinking more about it; before I believed I related most to number 2: religious indifference and a good dash of number 3 the cares and riches of the world with a great heaping helping of personal sin. I was not rejecting the Gospel because I was somehow revolting against in the world as reason not to believe, nor did care about scandals or hypocrites. Maybe a little on the prevailing negativity or lack thereof positive towards religion. If I had order these from most likely my attitude was from most to least was 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 1. Mainly, I was just indifferent to it all and didn\u2019t know much of anything, so I really did not care and because of my cares for the world and the things it namely my sinful desires I did not take it seriously. Then of course, I would hide from God out of fear and to flee his call, which I did during the middle part of my journey of faith as I was learning to commit my life to him. I would say now if there is anything that might hinder my faith it could be a revolt against the evil in the world. It sounds strange that what was least important to me before I believed would now be something that I could see making it difficult to believe. I might even say that the scandal and bad example on part of believers could also cause me to struggle in my faith. Oddly enough, I can definitely relate to all this attitudes although I don\u2019t hold any of them now I can see how I could and might have these views and where you might stand in the conversation?\n\nLet me know in the comments below.\n1 / 1", "longest_response": "Title: Personal Reflections on the Gospel: Why Some Struggle to Believe and How Scripture Helps\n\nIn this video, we will be exploring five reasons why some people may not believe or reject the proclamation of the Gospel, as presented by the Catholic Church. We will discuss these reasons and invite your thoughts and experiences in the comments below.\n\nThe Gospel is a message of salvation and an intimate relationship with God. It proclaims the Kingdom of God as a powerful transformative intervention by God, with a power equal to or even surpassing His creation of the world (GDC 101).\n\nBefore discussing the five reasons why some may not believe, let us first understand the perspectives of those who do:\n\n1. Revolt against evil in the world\n2. Religious ignorance or indifference\n3. The cares and riches of this world\n4. The scandal of bad examples on the part of believers\n5. Currents of thought hostile to religion\n6. Sinful man's attitude which makes him hide from God out of fear and flee His call (CCC 29)\n\nNow we invite you to reflect on these reasons and share which one or ones may have resonated with you at some point in your life. Consider whether these reasons might have hindered your belief and how you navigate these challenges now.\n\nPersonally, before I embraced faith, I found myself most affected by religious indifference and an appreciation for worldly riches, with a considerable dollop of personal sin. I was not actively revolting against the Gospel or paying heed to scandals and hypocrisy, and I may have felt slightly negatively towards religion. If I had to rank these reasons in order of impact on me, it would be:\n\n1. Religious indifference\n2. The cares and riches of the world\n3. Sinful man's attitude which makes him hide from God out of fear and flee His call\n4. Currents of thought hostile to religion\n5. The scandal of bad examples on part of believers\n6. Revolt against the evil in the world\n\nWhen immersed in my faith, these attitudes still linger, although they no longer deter me. In fact, I find myself facing new challenges, such as revulsion towards the evil in the world, which might potentially undermine my faith, or being affected by the scandals and bad examples of believers.\n\nOverall, the message of the Gospel is a transformative one, capable of offering not only liberation from oppression but an intimate bond with God. We invite you to share your thoughts and experiences related to these reasons in the comments below, and we will delve deeper into Scripture to further explore the Gospel message and its implications in our lives.", "shortest_response": "Title: Exploring Obstacles to Belief: Uncovering Your Reasons\n\nVideo Summary:\nIn this thought-provoking video, we delve into reasons why some individuals might find it challenging to believe in the Gospel, focusing on six obstacles outlined by the Catechism of the Catholic Church. These obstacles include revolt against evil in the world, religious ignorance or indifference, the cares and riches of this world, the scandal of bad example on the part of believers, currents of thought hostile to religion, and the intrinsic human fear that leads one to hide from God. The speaker, a fervent believer, shares his personal journey and how he identified with religious indifference and a preoccupation with worldly concerns and personal sin.

A simple example is the preference relation \u00bc on the set of nonnegative real numbers defined by x \u00bc y if and only if x \u2265 y , which is represented by\nthe utility function u defined by u(x) = x. However, not all preference relations\non infinite sets can be represented by utility functions. An example is the lexicographic preference relation over the unit square X = {(x1,x2) : x1,x2 \u2208 [0, 1]} for\nwhich the first priority is the first coordinate and the second priority is the second coordinate (so that, for example, (0.3, 0.1) \u001f (0.2, 0.9) \u001f (0.2, 0.8)). (Figure 1.4\nshows the set of alternatives preferred to a given alternative.)\nProposition 1.2: Preference relation not represented by utility function\nThe (lexicographic) preference relation \u00bc on {(x1,x2) : x1,x2 \u2208 [0, 1]} defined by (x1,x2) \u001f (y1,y2) if and only if either (i) x1 > y1 or (ii) x1 = y1 and\nx2 > y2 is not represented by any utility function.\nThe proof of this result requires more mathematical knowledge than the other\narguments in the book.\nProof\nAssume, contrary to the claim, that the function u represents \u00bc. For each\nx \u2208 [0, 1], we have (x, 1) \u001f (x, 0), so that u(x, 1) > u(x, 0). Define a function\nf that assigns to every number x \u2208 [0, 1] a rational number in the interval (u(x, 0),u(x, 1)). Such a number exists because between any two real\nnumbers there is a rational number. The function f is one-to-one since\nif a > b then (a, 0) \u001f (b, 1), so that u(a, 0) > u(b, 1), and hence the interval (u(a, 0),u(a, 1)) from which f (a) is selected does not intersect the\ninterval (u(b, 0),u(b, 1)) from which f (b) is selected. The contradiction igure 1.4 The set of alternatives preferred to (z 1,z 2) according to the lexicographic\npreference relation described in the text is the area shaded blue, excluding the part of\nthe boundary indicated by a dashed line.\nnow follows from Cantor\u2019s diagonal argument, which shows that there is\nno one-to-one function from the set [0, 1] into a countable set (like the set\nof rational numbers).\nIf a utility function represents a given preference relation, then many other\nutility functions do so too. For example, if the function u represents a given preference", "longest_response": "Under what conditions can a preference relation be represented by a utility function? For a preference relation on a finite set, any preference relation can be represented by a utility function. This is guaranteed by Proposition 1.1, which states that every preference relation on a finite set can be represented by a utility function. This result is proved using the definitions of minimal and maximal alternatives and an iterative process of removing alternatives from the set that are minimal with respect to the preference relation at each step. It's important to note that the proof only applies to finite sets; preference relations on infinite sets can have different properties, and not all of them can be represented by a utility function (such as the lexicographic preference relation over the unit square, as illustrated in the text).\n\nHere's some additional information about the process described in Proposition 1.1:\n\n1. Define Y0 = X, where X is the finite set and define M1 to be the set of alternatives minimal with respect to the preference relation in Y0. By Lemma 1.1, Y0 is not empty.\n\n2. For k \u2265 1 inductively define Yk = Yk\u22121 \\ Mk as long as Yk\u22121 is nonempty, and let Mk+1 be the (nonempty) set of alternatives minimal with respect to the preference relation in Yk. In other words, at every stage remove from the set of remaining alternatives the alternatives minimal with respect to the preference relation.\n\n3. For each k, the sets Mk contain alternatives that are minimal with respect to the preference relation among the alternatives in Yk. The process continues until no alternatives remain in Yk, at which point the set of minimal alternatives is empty.\n\n4. Define the utility function u(x) = k, where k is the smallest index such that x is not minimal in Yk (i.e., x is not in any Mk). Because every alternative is eventually removed, this index k uniquely identifies every alternative in the set.\n\n5. Because the process eventually terminates (since X is finite and the sets Yk are nonempty until the last step), the function u can uniquely identify every alternative in the set.\n\n6. It can be shown that this function u represents the preference relation in the sense that x \u00bc y if and only if u(x) \u2265 u(y).", "shortest_response": "To answer the question about the conditions under which a preference relation can be represented by a utility function, we need to know that every preference relation on a finite set has minimal and maximal members.

I was responsible in facilitating team meetings, completing the final project report, and assisting with research and developing a binary search algorithm to satisfy specific conditions provided by the problem. This 4-week project provided me with the opportunity to work with a group of like-minded individuals and utilize my analytical skills to solve problems and showcase my project management skills. During the quarantine in 2021, I took the initiative to complete the CS50 Series Course by Harvard University to learn various programing languages. Using the knowledge from this course, I was able to develop my own version of Black- Jack, Tic Tac Toe, and Hangman using Java and Python. During the winter 2022 semester, I was able to develop a merge sort algorithm (garbage collection included) with C using the knowledge learned from data structures and linked lists.\nThanks to my academic background in electronics and my hands on experience using lab hardware such as oscilloscopes, function generators, and spectrum analyzers, knowledge regarding analog/digital circuit analysis, reading schematics, software architecture, design and debugging, concept regarding power and performance are a few things I crave to learn more about. Additionally, being part of Toronto Met Formula Racing gave me an insight into hardware engineering and gaining technical experience by engaging with other sub-team members within the electrical drivetrain sub-team.\nOverall, I am confident that I will easily transition into the Summer Student role for Human Resources and effectively contribute to the team at METROLINX.

Along the journey, the team must also make decisions in response to 3 hidden challenges which affect their ascent, hiking speed, health, and overall success.", "longest_response": "Title: Reflection Memo: Team Exercise Simulated Mountain Climb\n\nDate: [Current Date]\n\nTo: [Course Instructor's Name]\nFrom: [Your Name]\n\nSubject: Analysis and Reflection on Simulated Mountain Climb Team Exercise in [Class Name]\n\nDear [Course Instructor's Name],\n\nI am writing to provide a reflection on the in-class team exercise we participated in, where our group simulated a mountain climb over 6 days. This engaging exercise consisted of five camps, and it was approximately 1.5 actual hours of seat time. As a team, we analyzed various factors such as weather, health conditions, supplies, goals, and hiking speed, and our group dynamic was crucial in making collective decisions to respond to hidden challenges that occurred throughout our ascent.\n\nIn this reflection, I have noted several key insights that arose during our journey up the mountain, including communication, decision-making under pressure, leadership dynamics, and adaptability.\n\n1. Communication: Effective communication is essential in the context of a team-based challenge like mountain climbing. In our group, we worked out a system to share crucial information with each other to ensure our team could respond effectively to various obstacles. The exchange of information occurred through various means, such as verbal communication, written notes, and visual aids.\n\nHowever, one point for improvement would be to develop a more efficient communication strategy to minimize time loss and ensure everyone is well-informed at all times. For instance, assigning roles to specific team members for coordinating and relaying information would streamline our communication process more effectively.\n\n2. Decision-making under pressure: The mountain climb presented numerous unexpected challenges that required quick and effective decision-making. Throughout our experience, I noticed several team members demonstrate their problem-solving skills, which ultimately contributed to the success of our team in overcoming these obstacles.\n\nHowever, there were moments where hesitation or indecision temporarily hindered our progress. To further develop our decision-making abilities under pressure, I suggest incorporating more practice scenarios where teams have to make quick decisions with limited time and resources.\n\n3. Leadership dynamics: Within our team, there were multiple instances where individuals emerged as natural leaders during various stages of the climb. Interestingly, roles shifted as challenges presented themselves, displaying our versatility and adaptability.\n\nMoving forward, I believe it would be beneficial to explore and discuss more about various leadership styles and their implications on team dynamics when overcoming challenges collectively. This would help us to develop a deeper understanding of our preferred leadership styles and how to leverage them in different scenarios.\n\n4. Adaptability: Our team demonstrated a high level of adaptability as several factors changed along the journey, including weather conditions, health, and hiking speed. By adjusting our plans and making necessary compromises, we managed to maintain our ascent and reach our goal.\n\nDespite this, there were opportunities where we might have made wiser decisions to adapt even quicker to changing circumstances. Improving our adaptability skills could be achieved through activities or exercises that present our team with dynamic challenges requiring us to rapidly adapt our strategies to succeed.\n\nIn conclusion, the simulated mountain climb exercise was a valuable opportunity for our team to grow and develop, both individually and collectively. The exercise demonstrated our resilience, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, and it served as a useful tool for understanding our strengths and weaknesses.\nAs we move forward, I believe it is essential that we continuously reflect on our performance and apply the lessons learned to future team-based challenges.\n\nI greatly appreciate the opportunity to participate in this exercise and look forward to discussing further insights with the group during our next class session.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]", "shortest_response": "Subject: Reflection Memo on In-Class Team Exercise: Simulated Mountain Ascent\n\nDear [Instructor's Name],\n\nI am writing to reflect on our recent in-class team exercise, which simulated a five-day mountain ascent over approximately 1.5 hours of seat time. I found this exercise to be an immensely valuable learning experience, as it allowed us to apply critical thinking, leadership, and teamwork skills in a dynamic and engaging context.\n\nThe exercise was cleverly designed to mimic real-world scenarios, where information is limited, decisions are critical, and communication is key. Our team of five students successfully navigated through five camps, making strategic decisions regarding weather conditions, health conditions, supplies, goals, and hiking speed.\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of the exercise was the element of uncertainty, represented by the three hidden challenges. These challenges tested our team's adaptability, forcing us to reevaluate our decisions and strategies on the fly. The experience reinforced the importance of effective communication within the team, as some information was more crucial to share than others in order to make informed and timely decisions.\n\nThroughout the exercise, I observed several leadership styles emerge among the team members. Some individuals took a more proactive, decisive approach, while others excelled at gathering and analyzing data before making recommendations. I believe that this diversity in leadership styles contributed significantly to our team's success, as it allowed us to consider different perspectives and make well-informed decisions under pressure.\n\nAs we move forward, I anticipate that these lessons learned will continue to inform how we approach team projects and challenges in the classroom and beyond. I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this exercise and look forward to future opportunities to apply these skills in different contexts.\n\nI would like to extend my sincere thanks to you and the rest of the teaching team for designing and facilitating this engaging and insightful exercise.

Simple songs: Learning songs in English is a fun way to practice new words and phrases. A popular choice is \"The Alphabet Song.\" Here are the first few lines:\n   - A, B, C, D, E, F, G...\n   - (To the tune of \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\")\n   - Ten little monkeys jumping on the bed...\n   - (To the tune of \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\")\n\n9. Simple games: In addition to songs, we can play simple games to reinforce learning. For example, I Spy, Simon Says, or even charades.\n\nNow that we have covered some basics, let's practice a few more phrases and see how much you've learned! What do you say when you want to go to the store? That's right! \"I want to go to the store.\" Now, can you tell me the name of the color of the grass outside?

They don\u2019t see it as viable for commercial use,\u201d he said at the time.\nThat was before Adobe had announced its own generative AI product. Just this morning the company released a beta of a new generative AI product [called Firefly](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/21/adobe-firefly-generative-ai/), and Adobe\u2019s president of digital media, David Wadhwani promised that companies needn\u2019t worry about the sourcing, and that artists would be taken care of, as well.\nIn an interview with [CNBC\u2019s Jon Fortt this morning](https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:7043929300810559488/), Wadhwani stated that the images being used in Firefly come from the company\u2019s own library. \u201cWe have the ability now to train on hundreds of millions of pieces of content that are fully licensed and are going to produce generative output that is safe for commercial use,\u201d he said.\nThe flip side of that is how the artist whose work is being used will be compensated.\n\u201cWe want to be very clear that we are doing this in a way that will ultimately be commercially good for them. And we\u2019re committing to making sure that we compensate them for revenues generated from Firefly \u2013 and we\u2019ll be releasing more of those details as we come out of the Firefly beta in the months ahead,\u201d Wadhwani told Fortt.\nThe devil will surely be in the details there, and artists will be watching closely to see if the company does indeed compensate them fairly. Wadhwani indicated they are working directly with the artists who contribute to Adobe Stock to figure out how this going to work in practice.\n\u201cFirst and foremost we want to do this in concert and in conversation with every one that is a contributor to the Adobe Stock. So we are reaching out. We\u2019ve already started conversations with the broad base of creators that are contributing, and we\u2019re not ready to state what we\u2019re going to do when we come out of beta because we\u2019re still learning. The most important thing is that we\u2019re committed to making sure that as we go through this process, we want to create more opportunity for the breadth of people who are contributing. And we think we can do that across the large contributors and the long tail,\u201d he said.\n\n> [Is generative AI really ready for the enterprise?](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/12/is-generative-ai-really-ready-for-the-enterprise/)\n> \n> \n\nHe says that ultimately, everybody should win because there will be so much more demand for content, and he believes that this can be good for both Adobe to attract new customers with less artistic skill to its platform, as well as the stock artists whose work is being used as a basis to generate new pieces.\n\u201cSo in that world where content becomes such a fuel for growth, we think that there\u2019s an opportunity to leverage generative technology and Adobe Stock and the broad base of contributors to make sure that they are making more money and being compensated for the incredible work that they\u2019re doing for this entire supply chain of content.\u201d\nTime will tell if that\u2019s the case.", "longest_response": "Titre original : Adobe assure une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9quitable des artistes avec son nouveau produit AI g\u00e9n\u00e9ratif, mais restent flous sur les d\u00e9tails\n\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9 : Le pr\u00e9sident de la m\u00e9dia digitale d'Adobe, David Wadhwani, a annonc\u00e9 la sortie de beta d'un nouveau produit AI g\u00e9n\u00e9ratif appel\u00e9 Firefly.

While I don't execute LaTeX code, I can explain the purpose of various LaTeX commands and symbols to help you better understand the math being represented. If you have a specific LaTeX code snippet that you'd like me to explain, feel free to ask!\n\nJust a quick example:\n```\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\begin{document}\n\\[\nf(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-x^2} dx\n\\]\n```\nIn this example, the LaTeX code is defining an integral expression for the function `f(x)`. The double dollar signs `$$` or `\\[` and `\\]` are used to format the expression as a displayed equation. The formula `f(x)` is the name of the function, and the integral symbol `\\int` is used to denote integrals. The subscript and superscript in `\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty` specify the lower and upper limits of integration, i.e., the integral is taken from negative infinity to positive infinity. Inside the integral sign, `e^{-x^2}` represents the integrand function (the function to be integrated). The `dx` is the differential symbol that indicates integration with respect to the variable `x`.\n\nIf you're new to LaTeX, I'd recommend checking out the LaTeX documentation or resources like the LaTeX Guide for Beginners by Tobias Oetiker, Stephan Lehmke, and Ralf Grabsch: <https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf>.

That day the sky was pretty clear but still I could see some little clouds on the big blue surface.

Here are some suggestions to further enhance your writing:\n\n1. Show, don't tell: Instead of stating that the mountains were \"gigantic\" or the snow was \"the whitest,\" provide sensory details that allow readers to visualize and feel the scene for themselves. For example, you could describe the mountains as \"massive, towering over the lake with a sense of awe-inspiring grandeur.\" Or, compare the snow to \"a fluffy, undisturbed blanket sprawled across the peaks.\"\n\n2. Vary sentence structure: To keep readers interested, try mixing up the length and structure of your sentences. For instance, you could start with longer, descriptive sentences like \"In front of me there were gigantic mountains covered with green trees and a lot of the whitest snow I've seen,\" then follow up with shorter, more succinct sentences like \"In the dark water I could see the reflection.\"\n\n3. Use sensory language: Appeal to as many senses as possible to create a richer, more immersive experience for your readers. Instead of simply describing the sky as \"clear,\" paint a picture by saying \"The sky, a brilliant shade of blue, stretched out invitingly, sprinkled with scattered, wispy clouds that looked like soft cotton candy.\"\n\n4. Employ figurative language: Metaphors, similes, and personification can add depth and creativity to your writing. For example, you could describe the mountains as \"silent sentinels standing tall\" or say that \"the sunlight danced playfully on the water's surface, creating ripples that glimmered like a thousand tiny diamonds.\"\n\n5. Use active voice: Active voice creates a more dynamic, engaging feel to your writing. Instead of saying \"The top of the mountains seemed so sharp that I thought they would cut the clouds,\" try rephrasing it as \"I marveled at the sharp peaks, imagining them slicing through the delicate clouds above.\"\n\nBy incorporating these elements into your writing, you will create a more captivating and immersive narrative that truly transports your readers to the breathtaking scene you experienced. Happy writing!", "shortest_response": "Your descriptive text is vivid and evocative, painting a beautiful and immersive image in the reader's mind. The use of sensory details, such as the soundless reflecting water, the whitest snow you've seen, and the delicate, cotton candy-like clouds, enhances the overall effect.\n\nThe simile you used to describe the mountains as sharp enough to cut the clouds adds a poetic touch to your text.

The game board represents a rail network map, showcasing potential projects, competitors, resources, and opportunities.\n\nPlayers navigate their team members across the map, attempting to gather necessary resources (e.g., expertise, budget, equipment, etc.). They can collaborate with other consultants (specialist cards) to increase their chances of success.\n\nIn the bid preparation phase, teams use their resources to create a high-quality bid that addresses the unique requirements of each project. This phase incorporates a time limit, encouraging teams to make strategic decisions about which projects to pursue and how to allocate their resources.\n\nOnce the bid deadline passes, the Project Review Committee will evaluate all bids based on quality, compliance, price, and innovation. The team with the highest-scoring bid wins the project and moves to the next round. The game continues until one team secures a minimum number of projects and emerges as the winner.\n\n3. Title: \"Line of Sight: The Bid Writers' Showdown\"\n\nGameplay: Players assume the role of bid writers, working together as a team to secure rail projects. The game board features a map of the railway network, with projects displayed as cards, each with a unique set of requirements, challenges, and competition levels.\n\nPlayers start with a set of basic resources (e.g., general knowledge, low budget, etc.) and must collaborate to gather the necessary expertise, budget, and equipment to craft a compelling bid. They can form alliances with other teams or rival them for resources and projects.\n\nPlayers can also choose to invest in research and development (R&D) to gain a competitive edge by unlocking new strategies, resources, or abilities.\n\nOnce a team decides to bid on a project, they move to the bid preparation area and use their resources to create a bid, addressing the specific project's requirements while showcasing unique selling points and value proposition.\n\nThe Project Review Committee evaluates all bids based on quality, compliance, price, and innovation. The team with the highest-scoring bid gains the project, rewards, and a resource advantage for future bids. The game continues until one team secures a minimum number of projects and emerges as the winner.\n\nIn all three games, the focus is on teamwork, strategic planning, resource management, and a deep understanding of the rail industry and bid-writing process. Players must navigate the complexities of bid writing to secure valuable rail projects and triumph in the Railways Bid Writers' Challenge.", "shortest_response": "Title: Railway Rush: The Bid Battle\n\n1. **Bid Board Drafting**: Players start with a set of generic bid documents and must strategically draft and customize their bid documents (e.g., project plan, budget, safety plan, sustainability plan) to align with various railway project requirements. Each bid document provides a unique bonus or advantage, but they are limited, so players must decide wisely which documents to add to their bid packet.\n\n2. **Questionnaire Quiz**: Throughout the game, players encounter unexpected questions or requests for additional information related to the railway project. These questions can be drawn from a questionnaire deck, with each question testing a different aspect of the bid (e.g., technical expertise, cost analysis, environmental impact assessment). Players who answer correctly earn points or special abilities, while incorrect answers may result in penalties or lost opportunities.\n\n3. **Networking and Collaboration**: Players can form alliances with other teams or bid writers, allowing them to share resources, knowledge, or collaborate on answers to challenging questions. However, forming alliances may come at a cost, such as sharing potential points or benefits in the final bid evaluation.\n\nIn the end, the team with the most points after addressing all railway project requirements and demonstrating the strongest bid wins the game.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this using Docker, Nginx, and Kubernetes with the Nginx Ingress Controller.\n\n1. Install Docker and Kubernetes on your system.\n\n2. Create a multi-vHost Nginx configuration file in the Docker container using a Dockerfile:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM nginx\nCOPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n```\n\nCreate the `nginx.conf` file in the same directory as the Dockerfile:\n\n```nginx\nworker_processes 1;\nevents { worker_connections 1024; }\n\nhttp {\n\n    server {\n        listen 80;\n        server_name account_1.local;\n        root /var/www/account_1;\n        index index.html;\n    }\n\n    server {\n        listen 80;\n        server_name account_2.local;\n        root /var/www/account_2;\n        index index.html;\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nReplace `account_1` and `account_2` with the desired account names or IP addresses. Ensure each server block has unique server_names.\n\n3. Build the Docker image:\n\n```\ndocker build -t my-nginx-app .\n```\n\n4. Run the Docker container:\n\n```\ndocker run -d -p 80:80 --name=my-nginx-app my-nginx-app\n```\n\n5. Install the Nginx Ingress Controller in Kubernetes. Ensure you have the Kubernetes configuration file (kubeconfig) and the `kubectl` command-line tool installed.\n\n6. Apply the following Kubernetes deployment and service definition files:\n\nDeployment file (nginx-deployment.yaml):\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-ingress-controller\n  namespace: ingress-nginx\nspec:\n  replicas: 3\n  selector:\n    app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx\n    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: ingress-nginx\n    k8s-app: ingress-nginx\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx\n        app.kubernetes.io/part-of: ingress-nginx\n        k8s-app: ingress-nginx\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx-ingress-controller\n        image: k8s.gcr.io/nginx-inchainer/nginx-ingress-controller:v1.1.0\n        ports:\n        - name: http\n          containerPort: 80\n          protocol: TCP\n        - name: tcp-services\n          containerPort: 443\n          protocol: TCP\n        readinessProbe:\n          httpGet:\n            path: /\n            port: 80\n        livenessProbe:\n          httpGet:\n            path: /\n            port: 80\n        Resources:\n          requests:\n            cpu: 0.1\n          limits:\n            cpu: 0.5\n          memory: 256Mi\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-ingress-controller\n  namespace: ingress-nginx\nspec:\n  type: LoadBalancer\n  selectedPort: 80\n  externalTrafficPolicy: Local\n  selector:\n    app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx\n    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: ingress-nginx\n  ports:\n  - name: http\n    port: 80\n    targetPort: http\n    protocol: TCP\n```\n\nBy default, the Nginx Ingress Controller will scrape and manage services with the label `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm`. If you are not using Helm, it's recommended to remove the `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm` label.\n\n7. Apply the manifest files using the `kubectl apply -f` command:\n\n```\nkubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml\n```\n\n8. Expose each Docker container service as a Kubernetes service with appropriate selectors (account name labels) in the Nginx Ingress Controller:\n\n```\nkubectl expose deployment my-nginx-app --name=account1-nginx-service --port=80 --target-port=80 --type=ClusterIP --label=account=account_1\nkubectl expose deployment my-nginx-app --name=account2-nginx-service --port=80 --target-port=80 --type=ClusterIP --label=account=account_2\n```\n\n9. Create Ingress resources in the Kubernetes namespace to expose each account service to the internet:\n\n```\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: account1-ingress\n  namespace: ingress-nginx\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx\n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx\n    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: ingress-nginx\n  rules:\n  - host: account_1.local\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: account1-nginx-service\n            port:\n              number: 80\n---\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: account2-ingress\n  namespace: ingress-nginx\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx\n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx\n    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: ingress-nginx\n  rules:\n  - host: account_2.local\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: account2-nginx-service\n            port:\n              number: 80\n```\n\nApply the Ingress files:\n\n```\nkubectl apply -f account1-ingress.yaml\nkubectl apply -f account2-ingress.yaml\n```\n\nNow, you can access the different accounts via domain names (e.g., `account_1.local`, `account_2.local`) on the local network by their respective IP addresses resolved by the host system's DNS server or configured manually.", "shortest_response": "Yes, it is possible to have multiple virtual hosts (vHosts) inside a Docker container and create an Ingress to access them within a local network. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you could follow:\n\n1. **Dockerize your web applications**: For each web application you want to host, create a Dockerfile that builds a Docker image containing the web server software and the application. Make sure to expose the appropriate port for the web server.\n\n2. **Configure multiple vHosts**: Within each container, you can configure multiple virtual hosts. This can be done by creating separate configuration files for each vHost and specifying them during container startup. The exact method for doing this depends on the web server software you are using.\n\n3. **Create Docker Network**: Set up a Docker network that will allow communication between your Docker containers. You can create a network during container creation or create a network beforehand and use it when creating containers.\n\n4. **Use Docker Compose**: To manage your containers, services, and network, you can use a Docker Compose file. This file defines all the services (your containers), networks, and volumes that your application requires.\n\n5. **Create Ingress for each application**: Using a Kubernetes Ingress resource, you can create rules for each web application hosted in your Docker containers. Each Ingress rule maps external traffic (in this case, local network traffic) to the appropriate service (Docker container).\n\n6. **Access web applications**: With the Ingress configured, you can access each web application on your local network using the specified Ingress subdomains or hostnames.\n\n7. **Update /etc/hosts**: To use these Ingress subdomains/hostnames, you may need to update your host file (`/etc/hosts` on Linux systems) to map the Ingress names to container IP addresses.", "input_size": 34, "output_sizes": [663, 692, 1708, 708, 420, 411, 702, 967, 534, 776], "output_mean": 758.1, "output_std": 353.6, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 566.25, "p50": 697.0, "p75": 759.0, "p99": 1641.31}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 50.37736}, {"sample_id": "d06cff9cc0e1817f", "prompt_id": "6d25a3161e4a3ef5", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "what are the top 20 painpoints for entrepreneurs, business owners, and creatives seeking a mindset or performance coach", "longest_response": "1.

We have a `for` loop going through `this.data` (line 5).\n2. Inside that loop, there is another `for` loop going through `otherData` (line 8).\n3. The `find()` function is applied on each element of `this.data` (line 5). `find()` has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of `this.data`.\n4. The anonymous function passed to `find()` contains a loop (lines 9-11) and a single condition check (line 10).\n5. If the found element doesn't match the condition (line 10), the inner loop terminates immediately, and the total time complexity of this iteration is O(1), provided that the comparison operation is efficient.\n6. If the found element matches the condition, the inner loop continues until it finds a mismatched value, which could occur multiple times if multiple matching elements disagree on a data point. But, since the number of mismatched data points will not exceed the number of properties, the maximum number of iterations in this inner loop will be equal to the number of properties, making it O(p). Here, p represents the number of properties in the data object.\n7. Since there is only one inner loop iterating over the other data, the overall Big O efficiency of the `hasMatchingData` method is `O(n * (O(1) + O(p)))`, where n is the size of `this.data` and p is the number of properties in the data object.\n\nSimplifying the Big O notation:\n\n    O(n * (O(1) + O(p))) => O(n + n*p) => O(np) where n>>1\n\nFinally, assuming that n is significantly larger than p, the Big O efficiency of the `hasMatchingData` method can be approximated as O(p).", "shortest_response": "I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but the code for the `hasMatchingData` method isn't provided.

In `pages/iframe.js`, create the `IframePage` component:\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { ServerStyleSheet } from 'styled-components';\nimport document from 'next/document';\nimport fetch from 'next/fetch';\n\nexport default class IframePage extends document {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { initialPage: null };\n    this.sheet = new ServerStyleSheet();\n  }\n\n  async getInitialProps({ req, res }) {\n    const styles = this.sheet.collectStyles();\n\n    res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'ALLOWALL'); // Allow iframe\n\n    const page = await fetch('https://your-iframe-content-api.com/api/your-endpoint', {\n      method: 'GET',\n      headers: {\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      },\n    });\n\n    if (page.ok) {\n      const initialPage = await page.json();\n      return { initialPage };\n    } else {\n      if (res) res.statusCode = 500;\n      return { initialPage: null };\n    }\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.sheet.seal();\n    const initialPage = this.props.initialPage;\n    const HeadComponent = initialPage.Head || null;\n    const bodyContent = initialPage.body;\n\n    if (this._document) {\n      // Extract the `<Head />` from the initial Next.js document\n      const headContent = this._document.head.children;\n\n      // Use the extracted head content in the iframe's `<Head />`\n      const head = (\n        <Head>\n          {headContent}\n          {HeadComponent}\n        </Head>\n      );\n\n      // Replace the `<Main />` with the body content\n      const main = (\n        <>\n          {bodyContent}\n        </>\n      );\n\n      // Append the head and main components to the document\n      this._document.firstChild.append(head);\n      this._document.firstChild.appendChild(main);\n    }\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const { initialPage } = this.props;\n    const iframeSrc = initialPage ? `data:text/html,${encodeURIComponent(initialPage.body)}` : '';\n\n    return (\n      <html>\n        <body>\n          <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: this._document.__html }} />\n          <iframe src={iframeSrc} title=\"Iframe Content\" frameBorder=\"0\"></iframe>\n        </body>\n      </html>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nReplace `https://your-iframe-content-api.com/api/your-endpoint` with the API to fetch the iframe content as JSON.\n\n5. Finally, in `components/link.js` (or similar), add support for an `iframe-src` Prop and update the `next/link` component:\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport nextLink from 'next/link';\n\nconst MyLink = props => {\n  const { as, href, iframeSrc, scroll, ...other } = props;\n\n  if (iframeSrc) {\n    return (\n      <iframe\n        src={iframeSrc}\n        // Add additional attributes as needed\n        {...other}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n\n  return nextLink(props);\n};\n\nexport default MyLink;\n```\n\nNow, you can use the `iframe-src` prop in your Next.js `Link` component:\n\n```jsx\nimport Link from '../components/link';\n\n// ...\n<Link iframe-src=\"https://your-iframe-content.com\" href=\"/iframe\">Go to IFrame</Link>\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to create a custom document and use the `next/http` API to fetch the iframe content on the server-side, allowing an iframe to be served from the server-side in Next.js. Make sure that the iframe content CORS policy is set correctly to avoid errors. Also, keep in mind that this approach might introduce additional performance issues, as the iframe content needs to be fetched and rendered on every page request.", "shortest_response": "To create an iframe in Next.js 13 (or any version) server-side, you should avoid doing it directly because Next.js runs on both server-side and client-side. Instead, you can return an HTML string containing the iframe on the server-side and let the browser handle it on the client-side. Here's an example:\n\n1. First, make sure to install `next` and `react` packages if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\nnpm install next react\n```\n\n2. Create a new file named `pages/iframe.js` and add the following content:\n\n```jsx\nimport { NextPage } from 'next';\n\nconst IframePage: NextPage = () => {\n  const iframeSrc = 'https://example.com'; // Replace with your iframe URL\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Server-side iframe example</h1>\n      <iframe src={iframeSrc} title=\"Iframe example\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default IframePage;\n```\n\nNow when you access the URL `http://localhost:3000/iframe` in your browser, it will display the iframe with the specified URL.", "input_size": 15, "output_sizes": [514, 446, 572,

However, Tensortrade is primarily designed for trading with the Decentralized Trading Exchange (DTX) with backtesting capabilities using TensorFlow or PyTorch. For using different exchange APIs like Interactive Brokers, you would need to implement a custom execution manager in Tensortrade.\n\nHere's a general outline of the steps you'd need to follow to integrate Interactive Brokers API with Tensortrade:\n\n1. Install the required packages:\n   ```bash\n   pip install ib_insync tensorflow tensortrade\n   ```\n\n2. Create a custom execution manager that uses the IB_insync's API:\n\n   ```python\n   from ib_insync.futures import *\n   from ib_insync.util import *\n   from tensortrade.execution import MarketExecutionManager, TradingError\n\n   class IbExecutionManager(MarketExecutionManager):\n       def __init__(self, client, contract):\n           super().__init__()\n           self.client = client\n           self.contract = contract\n           self.api = self.client.api\n\n       def place_order(self, order: Order) -> Order:\n           # Implement placing the order using IB_insync\n           try:\n               order_id = self.api.place_order(order, self.contract)\n               return Order(order_id, order.time_in_force, order.transaction_id,\n                             order.clOrdId, order.side, order.order_type, int(order.quantity),\n                             self.contract)\n           except Exception as e:\n               raise TradingError(f\"Error placing order: {str(e)}\")\n\n       def cancel_order(self, order_id: int) -> None:\n           # Implement canceling the order using IB_insync\n           try:\n               self.api.cancel_order(order_id, self.contract)\n           except Exception as e:\n               raise TradingError(f\"Error cancelling order: {str(e)}\")\n\n       # override other methods as needed\n   ```\n\n3. Create an instance of the custom execution manager and pass it to the TradingAgent:\n\n   ```python\n   from ib_insync import IB, Forex\n   from ib_insync.util import sleep\n\n   def on_data(contract, trade, bar):\n       # Handle incoming data\n       pass\n\n   def main():\n       ib = IB()\n       ib.connect('127.0.0.1', 7497, clientId=123)\n      forex_contract = Forex('EURUSD')\n       forex_execution_manager = IbExecutionManager(ib, forex_contract)\n\n       trading_agent = TradingAgent(\n           environment=SimpleEnv(data_handler=on_data),\n           execution_manager=forex_execution_manager\n       )\n\n       trading_agent.run()\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       main()\n   ```\n\nThis example assumes you're working with a foreign exchange (forex) contract. For futures contracts, you should import the relevant classes from the `ib_insync.futures` module instead.\n\nBy following these steps, you can use Interactive Brokers API with Tensortrade, but keep in mind that this implementation will not provide backtesting capabilities. For backtesting, you can either use DTX with simulated assets or create a custom backtesting environment to work with Interactive Brokers' historical data.", "shortest_response": "Yes, it is possible to use Interactive Brokers API or IB_insync with Tensortrade.

This custom data provider will need to use the Interactive Brokers API or IB_insync functions to request the necessary data.\n\n3. Implement a custom execution manager for Tensortrade to send orders to the Interactive Brokers API or IB_insync and handle any feedback.\n\n4.
