This is the most common system in duplicate bridge.\n2. **Undercall**: The bidding system where the player who bids undercalls (calls in a bid) is usually the declarer. This is less common than overcall, but still widely used.\n3. **Call**: The bidding system where the player who bids call (calls in a bid) is usually the declarer. This is a simple and straightforward system.\n4. **Take Call**: The bidding system where the player who bids take call (calls in a bid) is usually the declarer. This is a variation of the call system.\n\nIn terms of bidding order, the most common order is:\n\n1. **1-2**: Call\n2. **2-3**: Overcall\n3. **3-4**: Undercall\n4. **4-5**: Call\n5. **5-6**: Take Call\n6. **6-7**: Overcall\n7. **7-8**: Undercall\n\nIt's worth noting that duplicate bridge is a complex game, and the bidding system can vary depending on the specific game and the players' preferences. It's always a good idea to consult with other players or a duplicate bridge expert to learn more about the specific bidding system used in the game.\n\nIn general, the best bidding system is one that allows for a good balance between bidding and defense. The goal of duplicate bridge is to make a good bid that allows you to control the game and make a strong defense, while also trying to avoid making a bid that is too weak.", "input_size": 45, "output_sizes": [588, 455, 565, 9307, 15001, 495, 15001, 490, 476, 386], "output_mean": 4276.4, "output_std": 5962.69, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 479.5, "p50": 530.0, "p75": 7127.25, "p99": 15001.0}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 475.98227}, {"sample_id": "db5c0a0b65d5ea8a", "prompt_id": "9bc4261296d6a7da", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What are recommendations for some European cities to visit.", "longest_response": "Europe offers a diverse range of exciting cities to visit, each with its unique character, history, and attractions.

The story begins on Trantor, the capital of the 12,000-year-old Galactic Empire, powerful but slowly decaying. Hari Seldon, a mathematician and psychologist, has developed psychohistory, a new field of science and psychology that treats all possibilities in large societies by mathematics, allowing for the probabilistic prediction of future events.\n\nBy means of psychohistory, Seldon has discovered the decline and eventual fall of the Empire, angering the aristocratic members of the Commission of Public Safety, the de facto rulers of the Empire. The Commission considers Seldon's views and statements treasonous, and he is arrested along with the young mathematician Gaal Dornick, who has arrived on Trantor to join Seldon's group. Seldon is tried by the Commission; he defends his beliefs, explaining his theories and predictions, including his belief that the Empire will collapse in 300 years and while a Second Empire will eventually rise it will only come after a 30,000-year dark age. He informs the Commission that an alternative to this future is attainable and explains to them that creating a compendium of all human knowledge, the Encyclopedia Galactica, may not prevent the inevitable fall of the Empire but would reduce the dark age to one millennium.\n\nThe skeptical Commission, not wanting to make Seldon a martyr, offers him exile to a remote world, Terminus, with others who could help him create the Encyclopedia. He accepts their offer, prepares for the departure of the \"Encyclopedists\" and receives an imperial decree officially acknowledging his actions. Seldon informs Dornick that, despite the Empire's belief it won by exiling Seldon, the outcome was exactly what he had intended and hoped for. Terminus would be the home of the first Foundation while a second would be established \"at Star's End.\" Seldon then reveals that he is dying, and implores Dornick to become a leader in the new Foundation.", "longest_response": "Here are the full names of characters mentioned in the text, separated by newlines:\n\nHari Seldon\nGaal Dornick\nGalen Dornick (Gaal's brother)\nThe Commission of Public Safety (no individual names mentioned)", "shortest_response": "Hari Seldon\nGaal Dornick", "input_size": 479, "output_sizes": [28, 34, 11, 28, 28, 11, 51, 28, 34, 28], "output_mean": 28.1, "output_std": 10.86, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 28.0, "p50": 28.0, "p75": 32.5, "p99": 49.47}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "information_extraction", "gen_time": 0.56597}, {"sample_id": "3d1f46b0b16221fc", "prompt_id": "0476e9652a3c58f9", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What was the The Treaty of Tordesillas?\nContext: In 1383, John I of Castile, husband of Beatrice of Portugal and son-in-law of Ferdinand I of Portugal, claimed the throne of Portugal. A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by John of Aviz (later King John I of Portugal) and commanded by General Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira defeated the Castilians in the Battle of Aljubarrota. With this battle, the House of Aviz became the ruling house of Portugal.\n\nThe new ruling dynasty would proceed to push Portugal to the limelight of European politics and culture, creating and sponsoring works of literature, like the Cr\u00f3nicas d'el Rei D. Jo\u00e3o I by Fern\u00e3o Lopes, the first riding and hunting manual Livro da ensinan\u00e7a de bem cavalgar toda sela and O Leal Conselheiro both by King Edward of Portugal and the Portuguese translations of Cicero's De Oficiis and Seneca's De Beneficiis by the well traveled Prince Peter of Coimbra, as well as his magnum opus Tratado da Vertuosa Benfeytoria. In an effort of solidification and centralization of royal power the monarchs of this dynasty also ordered the compilation, organization and publication of the first three compilations of laws in Portugal: the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es d'el Rei D. Duarte, which was never enforced; the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Afonsinas, whose application and enforcement was not uniform across the realm; and the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Manuelinas, which took advantage of the printing press to reach every corner of the kingdom. The Avis Dynasty also sponsored works of architecture like the Mosteiro da Batalha (literally, the Monastery of the Battle) and led to the creation of the manueline style of architecture in the 16th century.\n\nPortugal also spearheaded European exploration of the world and the Age of Discovery. Prince Henry the Navigator, son of King John I of Portugal, became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour. During this period, Portugal explored the Atlantic Ocean, discovering the Atlantic archipelagos the Azores, Madeira, and Cape Verde; explored the African coast; colonized selected areas of Africa; discovered an eastern route to India via the Cape of Good Hope; discovered Brazil, explored the Indian Ocean, established trading routes throughout most of southern Asia; and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to China and Japan.\n\nIn 1415, Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering Ceuta, the first prosperous Islamic trade centre in North Africa. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: Madeira and the Azores, which led to the first colonization movements.\n\nIn 1422, by decree of King John I, Portugal officially abandoned the previous dating system, the Era of Caesar, and adopted the Anno Domini system, therefore becoming the last catholic realm to do so.\n\n\nThroughout the 15th century, Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for several common types of tradable commodities at the time, ranging from gold to slaves, as they looked for a route to India and its spices, which were coveted in Europe.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas, intended to resolve the dispute that had been created following the return of Christopher Columbus, was made by Pope Alexander VI, the mediator between Portugal and Spain. It was signed on 7 June 1494, and divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two countries along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa).\n\n\nIn 1498, Vasco da Gama accomplished what Columbus set out to do and became the first European to reach India by sea, bringing economic prosperity to Portugal and its population of 1.7 million residents, and helping to start the Portuguese Renaissance. In 1500, the Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real reached what is now Canada and founded the town of Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, Newfoundland and Labrador, long before the French and English in the 17th century, and being just one of many Portuguese colonizations of the Americas.\n\nIn 1500, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral discovered Brazil and claimed it for Portugal. Ten years later, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Goa in India, Muscat and Ormuz in the Persian Strait, and Malacca, now a state in Malaysia. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic. Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe, landing in such places as Taiwan, Japan, the island of Timor, and in the Moluccas.\n\nAlthough for a long period it was believed the Dutch were the first Europeans to arrive in Australia, there is also some evidence that the Portuguese may have discovered Australia in 1521. From 1519 to 1522, Ferdinand Magellan (Fern\u00e3o de Magalh\u00e3es) organized a Spanish expedition to the East Indies which resulted in the first circumnavigation of the globe. Magellan never made it back to Europe as he was killed by natives in the Philippines in 1521.\n\nThe Treaty of Zaragoza, signed on 22 April 1529 between Portugal and Spain, specified the anti-meridian to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas.\n\nAll these factors made Portugal one of the world's major economic, military, and political powers from the 15th century until the late 16th century.", "longest_response": "The Treaty of Tordesillas was a treaty signed on June 7, 1494, between Pope Alexander VI and King John I of Portugal and Spain. The treaty aimed to resolve the dispute over the newly discovered lands outside Europe, particularly in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn the early 15th century, Portugal had been exploring the Atlantic Ocean, establishing trade posts and colonies in the Americas. However, the Portuguese had been competing with the Spanish for control of the lands discovered by Christopher Columbus. The Treaty of Tordesillas was intended to resolve this dispute and divide the newly discovered lands between the two countries.\n\n**Key Provisions**\n\nThe treaty divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between Portugal and Spain along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands. This meridian was chosen to separate the lands of the Portuguese from those of the Spanish. The treaty also specified that the Portuguese would not colonize the lands discovered by the Spanish in the Americas.\n\n**Consequences**\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas had significant consequences for both Portugal and Spain. For Portugal, it marked the beginning of its rise as a major power in the world, as it gained control over the lands discovered in the Americas. The treaty also led to the establishment of the Portuguese Empire, which would eventually become one of the largest empires in the world.\n\nFor Spain, the treaty marked the beginning of the end of its dominance in the Americas. The Spanish had been trying to colonize the lands discovered by Columbus, but the Portuguese had been gaining control over the territories. The treaty also led to the establishment of the Spanish Empire, which would eventually become a major rival to the Portuguese Empire.\n\n**Impact on European History**\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas had a significant impact on European history.

The treaty also led to the establishment of the Portuguese Empire, which would eventually become one of the largest empires in the world.\n\nThe treaty also had significant economic and cultural impacts. It led to the establishment of trade relationships between Portugal and Spain, as well as the exchange of ideas and cultures between the two countries.

In fact, the first bicycle was invented by German Baron Karl von Drais in 1817. Over time, cycling became a popular way to get around cities, especially in the 1920s and 1930s, when the first Dutch cycling clubs and bike paths were established.\n2. **Social factors:** Cycling is often seen as a symbol of Dutch identity and culture. Many Dutch people grew up cycling and have continued to do so as a way of life. It's also a popular recreational activity, with many people enjoying cycling as a hobby.\n3. **Infrastructure:** The Netherlands has a well-developed cycling infrastructure, with extensive bike paths, bike lanes, and traffic-free zones. This makes it easy for people to cycle around the country, especially in urban areas.\n4. **Environmental factors:** Cycling is a relatively environmentally friendly mode of transportation, producing no emissions or noise pollution.

You can create a simple framework using cardboard or plastic sheets to provide additional support.\n\n**Finishing touches:**\n\n1. **Paint or markers:** If desired, paint or use markers to add color and details to the plane.\n2. **Final assembly:** Double-check the plane's structure and make any necessary adjustments.\n\n**Tips and variations:**\n\n* Use different colors and widths of duct tape to create a unique and visually appealing design.\n* Experiment with different shapes and designs for the fuselage and wings.\n* Add additional details, such as a cockpit or engine, using cardboard or plastic sheets.\n* Consider using a different type of material, such as balsa wood or foam board, for the fuselage and wings.\n\n**Challenges and limitations:**\n\n* The duct tape may not provide enough structural integrity for a long-range flight.\n* The wings may not be stable or aerodynamic due to the lightweight materials.\n* The plane may not be as durable or weather-resistant as a traditional aircraft.\n\nKeep in mind that building a duct tape plane is a challenging and unconventional project. The results may vary, and the plane may not be suitable for flight. However, with creativity and experimentation, you can create a unique and interesting aircraft that showcases the potential of duct tape as a building material.", "input_size": 69, "output_sizes": [720, 629, 619, 651, 756, 676, 664, 749, 708, 762], "output_mean": 693.4, "output_std": 50.28, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 654.25, "p50": 692.0, "p75": 741.75, "p99": 761.46}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "brainstorming", "gen_time": 7.99003}, {"sample_id": "0616e92e831bcc1b", "prompt_id": "1361ba405492cac2", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Name a very famous family of composers & musicians of late baroque", "longest_response": "One of the most famous families of composers and musicians of late Baroque is the Haydn family. \n\nJohann Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) was an Austrian composer, known as the \"Father of the Symphony\" for his contributions to the development of the symphony genre.

Here are some points to consider:\n\n**Dogs:**\n\n1. **Exercise companionship:** Dogs require regular exercise, which can encourage their owners to engage in physical activity, such as walking, running, or playing fetch. This can lead to improved cardiovascular health, weight management, and reduced sedentary behavior.\n2. **Social benefits:** Dogs can provide companionship and social support, which are essential for mental health and well-being. Studies have shown that dog owners tend to have lower levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness.\n3. **Improved sleep:** Dogs can help their owners establish a regular sleep schedule, as their presence can encourage a consistent bedtime routine.\n4. **Responsibility and structure:** Caring for a dog can provide a sense of purpose and structure, which can be beneficial for individuals with mobility issues, disabilities, or those who struggle with time management.\n\n**Cats:**\n\n1. **Low-maintenance exercise:** Cats are generally sedentary animals and require less exercise than dogs.

The game was a groundbreaking title that introduced the concept of a graphical user interface (GUI). Wright, who was tasked with creating a hidden message in the game, decided to create an Easter egg that would be accessible to players who were skilled enough to find it.\n\nThe Easter egg in Adventure was a simple message that read: \"Easter egg hunt\". This message was hidden in the game's code, and only players who were familiar with the game's internal workings could find it.\n\nThe Easter egg was a clever way to encourage players to explore the game's code and understand its inner workings. It also served as a form of Easter egg hunt, where players would have to search for the hidden message to claim their prize.\n\nThe success of the Easter egg in Adventure led to its adoption in other games, and soon, Easter eggs became a popular feature in many video games.\n\nIn the 1970s, Easter eggs were often used to create a sense of discovery and exploration in games. Players would have to dig through code, analyze data, and solve puzzles to find the hidden message or feature.\n\nThe concept of Easter eggs has since evolved, and today, they are a staple of the gaming industry. Many modern games feature Easter eggs, which can range from simple messages to complex puzzles and challenges.\n\nThe term \"Easter egg\" was coined by Steve Wright in 1979, and it has since become a standard term in the gaming industry to describe any hidden message, image, or feature that is embedded in a game or software.", "shortest_response": "The origin of the Easter egg in video games dates back to the early days of computer gaming.

Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting).

Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. **Conductive nature**: Aluminum is an excellent conductor of electricity, which means it can easily carry electrical current. This can lead to electrical shock if the wiring is damaged or improperly installed.\n2. **Thermal expansion**: When aluminum is heated, it expands and contracts rapidly, which can cause the wiring to become loose or damaged. This can lead to electrical shock or even a fire.\n3. **Corrosion**: Aluminum wiring can corrode over time, especially when exposed to moisture or saltwater. This can create an environment conducive to electrical shock and fires.\n4. **Poor insulation**: Aluminum wiring is often not properly insulated, which can allow electrical currents to flow through the wiring and into the home's electrical system.\n5. **Electrical shock**: If the wiring is damaged or improperly installed, it can create a path for electrical current to flow through the home's electrical system, potentially causing electrical shock or even a fire.\n\nAccording to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), aluminum wiring is the most common cause of home electrical fires in the United States. In fact, the NFPA reports that:\n\n* Between 2003 and 2007, there were 1,400 reported electrical fires in homes with aluminum wiring, resulting in an average of 1,600 injuries and 35 deaths per year.\n* Between 2008 and 2013, there were 2,400 reported electrical fires in homes with aluminum wiring, resulting in an average of 2,400 injuries and 60 deaths per year.\n\nTo minimize the risks associated with aluminum wiring, it's essential to:\n\n* Have your home's electrical system inspected and certified by a licensed electrician.\n* Hire a licensed electrician to install new wiring or upgrade existing wiring.\n* Use certified aluminum wiring that meets industry standards.\n* Keep the wiring and electrical system well-maintained and inspected regularly.\n\nIt's also a good idea to consider replacing older aluminum wiring with new, certified wiring that meets industry standards, such as:\n\n* UL (Underwriters Laboratories) 3005 or 3005A, which are the most common standards for aluminum wiring.\n* NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association) 310R, which is a more stringent standard for electrical wiring.\n\nBy taking these precautions, you can help ensure the safety of your home and its occupants.", "shortest_response": "Aluminum wiring in a home is considered a hazardous material due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Corrosion**: Over time, aluminum wiring can corrode, especially in humid or damp environments. This corrosion can weaken the wire, creating a pathway for electricity to flow through the insulation and into the wiring, causing electrical shock or even fires.\n2. **Friction**: When aluminum wires rub against each other, they can generate friction, which can lead to sparks and arcing. This can ignite flammable gases or vapors, causing a fire or explosion.\n3. **Heat buildup**: When an electrical current flows through the wiring, it can generate heat. If the wiring is not properly sized or insulated, this heat can build up, creating an electrical arc or spark that can ignite nearby flammable materials.\n4. **Grounding issues**: Aluminum wiring is not suitable for grounding purposes. Grounding is essential to prevent electrical shock and ensure safe operation of electrical systems. If the wiring is not grounded properly, it can create a path for electricity to flow through the insulation and into the wiring, causing electrical shock or even fires.\n5. **Poor installation practices**: Aluminum wiring was commonly used in older homes, and many of these homes were not installed or maintained properly. This can lead to a higher risk of electrical shock, fires, and other hazards.\n\nThe International Association of Electrical Inspectors (IAEI) recommends that aluminum wiring be replaced with copper or other materials, such as aluminum-clad copper (ACC) wiring, which is more resistant to corrosion and provides better electrical insulation.\n\nIt's essential to note that not all homes with aluminum wiring are at risk.

It is a standard language for accessing, managing, and modifying data in relational databases.\n\n**Key Features of SQL:**\n\n1. **SQL syntax**: SQL uses a standardized syntax to create, modify, and query databases.\n2. **Relational database model**: SQL is based on the relational database model, which consists of tables, rows, and columns.\n3. **SQL commands**: SQL commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, and DROP, among others.\n\n**SQL Statements:**\n\nHere are some common SQL statements:\n\n### SELECT\n\n* Retrieves data from a database table.\n* Syntax: `SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name;`\n* Example: `SELECT * FROM customers;`\n\n### INSERT\n\n* Inserts new data into a database table.\n* Syntax: `INSERT INTO table_name (column_name) VALUES (value);`\n* Example: `INSERT INTO customers (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');`\n\n### UPDATE\n\n* Modifies existing data in a database table.\n* Syntax: `UPDATE table_name SET column_name = value;`\n* Example: `UPDATE customers SET email = 'john2@example.com' WHERE name = 'John Doe';`\n\n### DELETE\n\n* Deletes data from a database table.\n* Syntax: `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`\n* Example: `DELETE FROM customers WHERE name = 'John Doe';`\n\n### CREATE\n\n* Creates a new database table.\n* Syntax: `CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name data_type);`\n* Example: `CREATE TABLE customers (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), email VARCHAR(255));`\n\n### DROP\n\n* Deletes a database table.\n* Syntax: `DROP TABLE table_name;`\n* Example: `DROP TABLE customers;`\n\n**SQL Basics:**\n\n1. **Data types**: SQL supports various data types, including integers, strings, dates, and timestamps.\n2. **Joining tables**: SQL allows you to join tables based on common columns.\n3. **Subqueries**: SQL supports subqueries, which allow you to execute a query inside another query.\n\n**SQL Example:**\n\nSuppose we have a database called `employees` with the following tables:\n\n* `employees` table:\n + `id` (primary key, integer)\n + `name`\n + `email`\n* `departments` table:\n + `id` (primary key, integer)\n + `name`\n + `manager_id` (foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `employees` table)\n\nWe want to retrieve all employees who are managers and are located in the `Sales` department.\n\n```sql\nSELECT e.id, e.name, e.email\nFROM employees e\nJOIN departments d ON e.manager_id = d.id\nWHERE d.name = 'Sales';\n```\n\nThis SQL statement uses a join to combine the `employees` and `departments` tables based on the `manager_id` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include employees who are managers and are located in the `Sales` department.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSQL is a powerful language for managing and manipulating data in relational databases.

List in the format {name} - {year} in a semicolon list.\nContext: Radiohead are an English rock band formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.\n\nRadiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in 1993. Their debut single, \"Creep\", became a worldwide hit. Radiohead's popularity and critical standing rose with the release of The Bends in 1995. Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music.\n\nRadiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though Kid A divided listeners, it was later named the best album of the decade by multiple outlets. It was followed by Amnesiac (2001), recorded in the same sessions. Hail to the Thief (2003), with lyrics addressing the War on Terror, blended the band's rock and electronic sides, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI.\n\nRadiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway, and O'Brien have released solo albums; in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.\n\nBy 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart: \"Creep\" (1992), \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" (1996), \"Paranoid Android\" (1997), \"Karma Police\" (1997), \"No Surprises\" (1998), \"Pyramid Song\" (2001), and \"There There\" (2003). \"Creep\" and \"Nude\" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Rolling Stone named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and Rolling Stone readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s.

It is an example of cannibalization.\nThe term alludes to the Osborne Computer Corporation, whose second product did not become available until more than a year after it was announced. The company's subsequent bankruptcy was widely blamed on reduced sales after the announcement.\nThe Osborne Effect states that prematurely discussing future, unavailable products damages sales of existing products. The name comes from the planned replacement of the Osborne 1, an early personal computer first sold by the Osborne Computer Corporation in 1981. In 1983, founder Adam Osborne pre-announced several next-generation computer models (the Osborne Executive and Osborne Vixen), which were only prototypes, highlighting the fact that they would outperform the existing model as the prototypes dramatically cut down assembly time. A widely held belief was that sales of the Osborne 1 fell sharply as customers anticipated those more advanced systems, leading to a sales decline from which Osborne Computer was unable to recover. This belief appeared in the media almost immediately after the company's September 1983 bankruptcy:\n\nTo give the jazzy $2,495 Osborne Executive a running start, Adam began orchestrating publicity early in 1983. We, along with many other magazines, were shown the machine in locked hotel rooms. We were required not to have anything in print about it until the planned release date in mid-April. As far as we know, nothing did appear in print, but dealers heard about the plans and cancelled orders for the Osborne 1 in droves. In early April, Osborne told dealers he would be showing them the machine on a one-week tour the week of 17 April, and emphasized that the new machine was not a competitor for the Osborne 1. But dealers didn't react the way Osborne expected; said Osborne, \"All of them just cancelled their orders for the Osborne 1.\"\n\nOsborne reacted by drastically cutting prices on the Osborne 1 in an effort to stimulate cash flow. But nothing seemed to work, and for several months sales were practically non-existent.\n\nPre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, with the revenue drop for the current product being offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available. However, when the Osborne effect occurs, the quantity of unsold goods increases and the company must react by discounting and/or lowering production of the current product, both of which depress cash flow.", "longest_response": "Unfortunately, the passage does not mention the price of the Osborne 1.

The passage mentions that the Osborne Executive was sold for $2,495, which is a significant price point for a personal computer at the time.\n\nTherefore, a reasonable guess for the price of the Osborne 1 would be in the range of $5,000 to $7,000, which was a relatively high price point for a personal computer at the time.", "shortest_response": "The price of the Osborne 1 was $2,495.", "input_size": 613, "output_sizes": [14, 14, 138, 14, 240, 44, 15, 48, 14, 15], "output_mean": 55.6, "output_std": 71.56, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 14.0, "p50": 15.0, "p75": 47.0, "p99": 230.82}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "information_extraction", "gen_time": 2.53634}, {"sample_id": "5dfac655476725a4", "prompt_id": "c210d7d79739ee8c", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "How many strings are on a violin?", "longest_response": "The number of strings on a violin can vary depending on the type of violin.

Here are some of the main explanations:\n\n1. **Evolutionary advantage**: In the early days of plant evolution, green coloration provided plants with a selective advantage. It helped them to absorb sunlight, which is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which plants produce energy from sunlight. Green coloration allowed plants to capture the most energy from the sun, which gave them an edge over other organisms.\n2. **Photosynthesis**: Chlorophyll, a green pigment found in plant cells, is responsible for absorbing light energy from the sun and transferring it to other molecules. Chlorophyll is present in the chloroplasts of plant cells, which are the organelles responsible for photosynthesis.\n3. **Light absorption**: Chlorophyll and other pigments in plant cells absorb light energy from the sun and transfer it to other molecules, which are then used to produce glucose and oxygen. The green color of plants is a result of the absorption of light energy by these pigments.\n4. **Structural coloration**: Green coloration in plants can also be attributed to structural coloration, which refers to the way light interacts with the microscopic structure of plant cells. The arrangement of pigments and the structure of the cell wall can create a greenish hue.\n5. **Environmental factors**: The color of a plant can also be influenced by environmental factors such as the amount of light it receives, the temperature, and the presence of other pigments.\n\nSome other pigments that contribute to the green coloration of plants include:\n\n* **Carotenoids**: These pigments are responsible for the yellow, orange, and brown colors of many plants. Carotenoids are more common in plants that live in areas with limited sunlight, such as in shaded forests.\n* **Anthocyanins**: These pigments are responsible for the red and purple colors of many plants. Anthocyanins are more common in plants that live in areas with high levels of sunlight, such as in sun-drenched fields.\n* **Betacyanins**: These pigments are responsible for the red and purple colors of some plants. Betacyanins are more common in plants that live in areas with limited sunlight, such as in shaded forests.\n\nIn summary, the green coloration of plants is a result of a combination of evolutionary, structural, and environmental factors.", "shortest_response": "Plants are green due to a combination of factors that allow them to absorb sunlight and convert it into energy. Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. **Chlorophyll**: The primary pigment responsible for photosynthesis in plants is called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is a green pigment that absorbs light energy from the sun, which is then used to power photosynthesis.\n2. **Light absorption**: Chlorophyll absorbs light energy from the sun, specifically in the blue and red parts of the visible spectrum. This energy is then converted into chemical energy, which is used to power photosynthesis.\n3. **Water absorption**: Chlorophyll also absorbs water molecules from the soil, which are then used to convert carbon dioxide and light energy into glucose and oxygen.\n4. **Stomatal opening**: Chlorophyll also allows plants to open and close their stomata (small openings on the leaves) to regulate gas exchange and water loss.\n\nWhen light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll, it excites an electron, which is then released as heat. This process is called photosynthesis. Chlorophyll is the key component that allows plants to harness the energy from sunlight and convert it into a usable form.\n\nIn summary, the green color of plants is due to the presence of chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy and powers photosynthesis.", "input_size": 41, "output_sizes": [347, 351, 357, 434, 472, 482, 376, 387, 395, 271], "output_mean": 387.2, "output_std": 59.91, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 352.5, "p50": 381.5, "p75": 424.25, "p99": 481.1}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 5.06533}, {"sample_id": "4301fa771d4359f0", "prompt_id": "f73169ecd047b2b2", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "How reliable is public transportation?", "longest_response": "The reliability of public transportation can vary greatly depending on several factors, including the type of transportation, the city or region, and the specific routes and schedules.

Here's why:\n\n**Basic Idea:**\n\nThe algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the input number by 2 until the result is less than 1. At each step, the average of the input and the previous result is calculated. The process continues until the result is less than 1, at which point the algorithm stops and returns the final result.\n\n**Mathematical Explanation:**\n\nLet's consider a number `x` and its square root `y`. We can represent the square root as `x = y^2`. We want to find the square root of `x` using the divide and average method.\n\nAt the first step, we calculate `y` as `y = x / 2`. This gives us a new value of `y`, which is the square root of `x`. We then calculate the average of `x` and `y`, which is `average = (x + y) / 2`.\n\nWe repeat this process at each subsequent step, using the new value of `y` as the input to the previous step. The average is calculated as `average = (x + y) / 2`, where `x` is the previous value of `y`.\n\n**Why it Works:**\n\nThe divide and average method works because it effectively \"smoothing out\" the differences between consecutive values. By repeatedly dividing the input by 2, we are essentially reducing the difference between the input and the previous result.\n\nAs we continue to divide the input by 2, the differences between consecutive values decrease rapidly, allowing us to converge on the correct value of the square root. The average of the input and the previous result is always less than 1, so we continue to divide the input by 2 until the result is less than 1.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\nSuppose we want to compute the square root of 16. We start with `x = 16` and `y = 8`.\n\n1. `y = x / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8`\n2. `average = (x + y) / 2 = (16 + 8) / 2 = 24 / 2 = 12`\n3. `y = x / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8`\n4. `average = (x + y) / 2 = (16 + 8) / 2 = 24 / 2 = 12`\n5. We repeat steps 1-4 until the result is less than 1, at which point we stop.\n\nThe final result is `y = 12`, which is the square root of 16.\n\nIn summary, the divide and average method for computing square roots works because it effectively \"smooths out\" the differences between consecutive values, allowing us to converge on the correct value of the square root.", "shortest_response": "The divide and average method for computing square roots is based on the following mathematical formula:\n\n\u221a(a) = (a + 1) / 2\n\nThis method works because it uses the concept of square roots as the inverse operation of squaring. When you square a number, you get a perfect square. The square root of a perfect square is the number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original perfect square.\n\nIn the case of the divide and average method, the formula works because it takes the average of the two numbers on either side of the division sign (a + 1) and then divides by 2. This effectively \"squares\" the result, giving you the square root of the original number.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Calculate the average of a and 1:\n   (a + 1) / 2\n\n2. Square the result:\n   ((a + 1) / 2)\u00b2 = (a + 1)\u00b2 / 4\n\n3. Simplify the expression:\n   (a + 1)\u00b2 / 4 = a\u00b2 + 2a + 1 / 4\n\n4.

As the largest optical telescope in space, it is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars, the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.\n\nThe U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led JWST's design and development and partnered with two main agencies: the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Maryland managed telescope development, while the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore on the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University currently operates JWST. The primary contractor for the project was Northrop Grumman. The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana, and arrived at the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point in January 2022. The first JWST image was released to the public via a press conference on 11 July 2022.\n\nJWST's primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated beryllium, which combined create a 6.5-meter-diameter (21 ft) mirror, compared with Hubble's 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). This gives JWST a light-collecting area of about 25 square meters, about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet and visible (0.1 to 0.8 \u03bcm), and near infrared (0.8\u20132.5 \u03bcm) spectra, JWST observes a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light (red) through mid-infrared (0.6\u201328.3 \u03bcm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below 50 K (\u2212223 \u00b0C; \u2212370 \u00b0F), such that the infrared light emitted by the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. It is deployed in a solar orbit near the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point, about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 mi) from Earth, where its five-layer sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\n\nInitial designs for the telescope, then named the Next Generation Space Telescope, began in 1996. Two concept studies were commissioned in 1999, for a potential launch in 2007 and a US$1 billion budget. The program was plagued with enormous cost overruns and delays; a major redesign in 2005 led to the current approach, with construction completed in 2016 at a total cost of US$10 billion. The high-stakes nature of the launch and the telescope's complexity were remarked upon by the media, scientists, and engineers.", "longest_response": "Here's a summary of the James Webb Space Telescope:\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a cutting-edge space telescope designed to conduct infrared astronomy.

Revenue and expense should be kept separate from personal expenses.\nGoing Concern: assumes that the business will be in operation indefinitely. This validates the methods of asset capitalization, depreciation, and amortization. Only when liquidation is certain this assumption is not applicable. The business will continue to exist in the unforeseeable future.\nMonetary Unit principle: assumes a stable currency is going to be the unit of record. The FASB accepts the nominal value of the US Dollar as the monetary unit of record unadjusted for inflation.\nTime-period principle: implies that the economic activities of an enterprise can be divided into artificial time periods.\nPrinciples\nHistorical cost principle: requires companies to account and report assets and liabilities acquisition costs rather than fair market value. This principle provides information that is reliable (removing opportunity to provide subjective and potentially biased market values), but not very relevant. Thus there is a trend to use fair values. Most debts and securities are now reported at market values.\nRevenue recognition principle: holds that companies should record revenue when earned but not when received. The flow of cash does not have any bearing on the recognition of revenue. This is the essence of accrual basis accounting. Conversely, however, losses must be recognized when their occurrence becomes probable, whether or not it has actually occurred. This comports with the constraint of conservatism, yet brings it into conflict with the constraint of consistency, in that reflecting revenues/gains is inconsistent with the way in which losses are reflected.\nMatching principle: expenses have to be matched with revenues as long as it is reasonable to do so. Expenses are recognized not when the work is performed, or when a product is produced, but when the work or the product actually makes its contribution to revenue. Only if no connection with revenue can be established, cost may be charged as expenses to the current period (e.g., office salaries and other administrative expenses). This principle allows greater evaluation of actual profitability and performance (shows how much was spent to earn revenue). Depreciation and Cost of Goods Sold are good examples of application of this principle.\nFull disclosure principle: Amount and kinds of information disclosed should be decided based on trade-off analysis as a larger amount of information costs more to prepare and use. Information disclosed should be enough to make a judgment while keeping costs reasonable. Information is presented in the main body of financial statements, in the notes or as supplementary information\nConstraints\nObjectivity principle: The company financial statements provided by the accountants should be based on objective evidence.\nMateriality principle: The significance of an item should be considered when it is reported. An item is considered significant when it would affect the decision of a reasonable individual.\nConsistency principle: The company uses the same accounting principles and methods from period to period.\nConservatism principle: When choosing between two solutions, the one which has the less favorable outcome is the solution which should be chosen (see convention of conservatism)\nCost Constraint: The benefits of reporting financial information should justify and be greater than the costs imposed on supplying it.", "longest_response": "The four basic principles of GAAP accounting are:\n\n1. **Assumptions**: These principles ensure that the accounting methods used are consistent and reasonable.

It's essentially a query that fetches the data and stores it in a physical table or set of tables, which can be used for further queries or analysis. This process is called \"materialization.\"\n\n**Types of Materialized Views**\n\nThere are several types of materialized views:\n\n1. **Local Materialized View**: Stores the results of a query on the same server as the original query.\n2. **Remote Materialized View**: Stores the results of a query on a different server or database.\n3. **Temporary Materialized View**: A temporary storage of the results of a query, which is discarded when the query is completed.\n\n**How Materialized Views Work**\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how materialized views work:\n\n1. **Query**: A user queries the database using a query.\n2. **Materialization**: The database materializes the query result into a physical table or set of tables.\n3. **Storage**: The materialized view is stored in the database, along with any additional metadata (e.g., indexes, constraints).\n4. **Query Execution**: When a query is executed on the materialized view, the database uses the stored data to perform the query.\n5. **Results**: The database returns the results of the query, which are stored in the physical table or set of tables.\n\n**Benefits of Materialized Views**\n\nMaterialized views offer several benefits, including:\n\n1. **Faster Query Execution**: Materialized views can reduce the time it takes to execute queries, as the database can use the pre-computed results.\n2. **Improved Performance**: Materialized views can improve query performance by reducing the number of rows that need to be retrieved from the database.\n3. **Reduced Disk Space**: Materialized views can reduce disk space usage, as the pre-computed data is stored in a physical table or set of tables.\n\n**Real-World Example**\n\nSuppose you have a table called `employees` with columns `id`, `name`, and `salary`. You want to create a materialized view that stores the `salary` column for each employee. The materialized view would be created with the following SQL statement:\n```sql\nCREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_salaries AS\nSELECT id, name, salary\nFROM employees;\n```\nThis materialized view would store the `salary` column for each employee, and you can query it using the following SQL statement:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM employee_salaries WHERE salary > 50000;\n```\nThis query would retrieve the employees with salaries greater than $50,000, without having to retrieve the entire `employees` table.\n\nIn summary, materialized views are a powerful tool for improving query performance, reducing disk space usage, and simplifying data analysis.

Her genre-spanning discography, songwriting abilities and artistic reinventions have received critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country artist to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.\nSwift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\nExiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021\u2014Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her 2022 album Midnights and single \"Anti-Hero\" broke all-time streaming records. Swift has directed music videos and films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and played supporting roles in others.\nHaving sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians in history. She is the most streamed woman on Spotify and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards; and 92 Guinness World Records. Swift has been featured in rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment.

Isn't it possible that the listener would associate \"pencil\" with \"wood\"? Maybe the listener would associate the word \"pencil\" with \"round\" instead (as pencils are, usually, in fact, round!). Wittgenstein writes regarding several possible \"interpretations\" which may arise after such a lesson. The student may interpret your pointing at a pencil and saying \"pencil\" to mean the following: (1) This is a pencil; (2) This is round; (3) This is wood; (4) This is one; (5) This is hard, etc., etc.", "longest_response": "In the context of Wittgenstein's \"ostensive defining\" method, he views the problem of learning a language as a challenge to the notion of a fixed, essential meaning. Wittgenstein argues that language is not a fixed system of symbols with absolute meanings, but rather a dynamic and context-dependent system of signs that are used to convey meaning through various interpretive strategies.\n\nWittgenstein's main concern is that the learner's understanding of a word or concept is not a direct reflection of the word's meaning, but rather a product of the learner's interpretation and context. He calls this a \"interpretive strategy\" or a \"language game.\" In other words, the learner uses the word or concept as a tool to communicate meaning, and their interpretation is not necessarily a direct reflection of the word's meaning.\n\nWittgenstein's example of teaching someone to call a pencil a \"pencil\" is a classic illustration of this problem. As you pointed out, the learner may interpret the pointing and saying \"pencil\" in different ways, depending on their context, prior knowledge, and cultural background. This is precisely the kind of ambiguity that Wittgenstein is concerned with.\n\nWittgenstein's solution to this problem is to emphasize that language is a social and contextual phenomenon, and that meaning is not fixed or essential, but rather depends on the context in which it is used. He argues that the learner's understanding of a word or concept is not a direct reflection of the word's meaning, but rather a product of the learner's interpretation and context.\n\nIn other words, Wittgenstein is saying that the learner's understanding of a word or concept is not a fixed or absolute concept, but rather a dynamic and context-dependent interpretation. This is in contrast to the idea that language has a fixed, essential meaning that is independent of context.\n\nWittgenstein's views on the problem of language learning can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Language is a social and contextual phenomenon, and meaning is not fixed or essential.\n2. The learner's understanding of a word or concept is not a direct reflection of the word's meaning.\n3. Interpretive strategies and language games are essential for understanding language.\n4. The learner's interpretation is not necessarily a direct reflection of the word's meaning, but rather a product of the context in which it is used.\n\nOverall, Wittgenstein's views on the problem of language learning emphasize the importance of context, interpretation, and social understanding in shaping our understanding of language.", "shortest_response": "Wittgenstein views a problem with learning a language using \"ostensive defining\" as the challenge of communicating the meaning of a concept or object through its physical presence. Specifically, he argues that the process of defining a concept through pointing and saying the word \"pencil\" can lead to multiple possible interpretations, as you mentioned.\n\nIn other words, Wittgenstein suggests that the listener may not be able to determine the intended meaning of the word \"pencil\" based solely on the physical presence of the object. This is because the listener may associate the word \"pencil\" with other meanings, such as \"wood\" or \"round\", due to prior experiences, cultural background, or other factors.\n\nWittgenstein's solution to this problem is to recognize that language is not a purely physical or empirical concept, but rather a complex system of signs and meanings that are embedded in our shared culture and language. He argues that language is not just a matter of pointing at an object and saying the word, but rather it requires a deeper understanding of the social and cultural context in which we use language.\n\nIn this sense, Wittgenstein is highlighting the importance of understanding the role of language in shaping our perceptions and experiences of the world. By recognizing the multiple possible interpretations of a word or concept, we can begin to understand the complexities of language and the ways in which it can be used to convey meaning and create meaning in the world.", "input_size": 272, "output_sizes": [395, 427, 389, 373, 382, 377, 507, 289, 355, 334], "output_mean": 382.8, "output_std": 54.45, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 359.5, "p50": 379.5, "p75": 393.5, "p99": 499.8}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "information_extraction", "gen_time": 5.3567}, {"sample_id": "99bd002fcc008fdb", "prompt_id": "2678b784a17d61a6", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Write a letter to your friend expressing your feelings about earning your first wage.", "longest_response": "Dear [Friend's Name],\n\nI'm sitting down to write to you with a mix of emotions - excitement, nervousness, and a hint of relief.
