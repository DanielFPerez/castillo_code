A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by John of Aviz (later King John I of Portugal) and commanded by General Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira defeated the Castilians in the Battle of Aljubarrota. With this battle, the House of Aviz became the ruling house of Portugal.\n\nThe new ruling dynasty would proceed to push Portugal to the limelight of European politics and culture, creating and sponsoring works of literature, like the Cr\u00f3nicas d'el Rei D. Jo\u00e3o I by Fern\u00e3o Lopes, the first riding and hunting manual Livro da ensinan\u00e7a de bem cavalgar toda sela and O Leal Conselheiro both by King Edward of Portugal and the Portuguese translations of Cicero's De Oficiis and Seneca's De Beneficiis by the well traveled Prince Peter of Coimbra, as well as his magnum opus Tratado da Vertuosa Benfeytoria. In an effort of solidification and centralization of royal power the monarchs of this dynasty also ordered the compilation, organization and publication of the first three compilations of laws in Portugal: the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es d'el Rei D. Duarte, which was never enforced; the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Afonsinas, whose application and enforcement was not uniform across the realm; and the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Manuelinas, which took advantage of the printing press to reach every corner of the kingdom. The Avis Dynasty also sponsored works of architecture like the Mosteiro da Batalha (literally, the Monastery of the Battle) and led to the creation of the manueline style of architecture in the 16th century.\n\nPortugal also spearheaded European exploration of the world and the Age of Discovery. Prince Henry the Navigator, son of King John I of Portugal, became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour. During this period, Portugal explored the Atlantic Ocean, discovering the Atlantic archipelagos the Azores, Madeira, and Cape Verde; explored the African coast; colonized selected areas of Africa; discovered an eastern route to India via the Cape of Good Hope; discovered Brazil, explored the Indian Ocean, established trading routes throughout most of southern Asia; and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to China and Japan.\n\nIn 1415, Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering Ceuta, the first prosperous Islamic trade centre in North Africa. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: Madeira and the Azores, which led to the first colonization movements.\n\nIn 1422, by decree of King John I, Portugal officially abandoned the previous dating system, the Era of Caesar, and adopted the Anno Domini system, therefore becoming the last catholic realm to do so.\n\n\nThroughout the 15th century, Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for several common types of tradable commodities at the time, ranging from gold to slaves, as they looked for a route to India and its spices, which were coveted in Europe.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas, intended to resolve the dispute that had been created following the return of Christopher Columbus, was made by Pope Alexander VI, the mediator between Portugal and Spain. It was signed on 7 June 1494, and divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two countries along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa).\n\n\nIn 1498, Vasco da Gama accomplished what Columbus set out to do and became the first European to reach India by sea, bringing economic prosperity to Portugal and its population of 1.7 million residents, and helping to start the Portuguese Renaissance. In 1500, the Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real reached what is now Canada and founded the town of Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, Newfoundland and Labrador, long before the French and English in the 17th century, and being just one of many Portuguese colonizations of the Americas.\n\nIn 1500, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral discovered Brazil and claimed it for Portugal. Ten years later, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Goa in India, Muscat and Ormuz in the Persian Strait, and Malacca, now a state in Malaysia. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic. Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe, landing in such places as Taiwan, Japan, the island of Timor, and in the Moluccas.\n\nAlthough for a long period it was believed the Dutch were the first Europeans to arrive in Australia, there is also some evidence that the Portuguese may have discovered Australia in 1521. From 1519 to 1522, Ferdinand Magellan (Fern\u00e3o de Magalh\u00e3es) organized a Spanish expedition to the East Indies which resulted in the first circumnavigation of the globe. Magellan never made it back to Europe as he was killed by natives in the Philippines in 1521.\n\nThe Treaty of Zaragoza, signed on 22 April 1529 between Portugal and Spain, specified the anti-meridian to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas.\n\nAll these factors made Portugal one of the world's major economic, military, and political powers from the 15th century until the late 16th century.", "longest_response": "The Treaty of Tordesillas was a treaty signed on June 7, 1494, during the pontificate of Pope Alexander VI.

It is primarily used for processing batch data, but it can also be used for real-time data processing and other big data applications. The key components of Hadoop are:\n\n1. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS): HDFS is a distributed file system that is used for storing large data sets in a distributed and scalable manner. It is designed to run on commodity hardware and provides high throughput access to application data. Data is stored in a hierarchical file system where each file is split into multiple blocks and replicated across multiple data nodes.\n2. MapReduce: MapReduce is the primary programming model for Hadoop. It provides a way to process large data sets in a distributed and parallel manner. The MapReduce model consists of two phases: Map and Reduce. In the Map phase, the data is partitioned and processed in parallel by map tasks. In the Reduce phase, the intermediate results are combined and processed to produce the final output.\n3. YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator): YARN is a resource management layer that enables Hadoop to run multiple workloads on a single cluster simultaneously. It provides a flexible and scalable resource management system that allocates resources to different applications based on their needs. YARN allows multiple frameworks, such as MapReduce, Spark, and others, to run on the same Hadoop cluster.\n4. Apache HBase: HBase is a distributed, column-oriented NoSQL database that is built on top of HDFS. It provides low-latency read and write access to large data sets and is often used as a real-time data store for big data applications. HBase supports massive scale and is designed to handle billions of rows and columns of data.\n5. Apache Pig: Pig is a dataflow language and execution framework for analyzing large data sets. It provides an abstraction layer over MapReduce and allows data scientists and engineers to write programs in a high-level language called Pig Latin. Pig enables fast data processing and analysis, and it integrates easily with other Hadoop components such as HDFS and HBase.\n6. Apache Hive: Hive is a data warehousing tool for Hadoop that provides a SQL-like interface for querying data stored in HDFS. It allows users to write SQL-like queries against large data sets and generates MapReduce jobs to execute the queries. Hive is useful for analytics, reporting, and business intelligence applications.\n7. Apache Spark: Spark is a fast and scalable distributed computing engine that provides an alternative to MapReduce for big data processing. Unlike MapReduce, Spark provides an in-memory cluster computing system that can handle interactive queries and stream processing. Spark has become a popular choice for big data processing due to its speed and flexibility.\n8. Apache Flume: Flume is a data collection and streaming tool for Hadoop. It provides a way to collect, aggregate, and move large amounts of log data into Hadoop for processing. Flume is often used as a source for batch processing and real-time data streams in Hadoop.\n9. Apache Sqoop: Sqoop is a tool for transferring bulk data between Hadoop and relational databases. It provides a way to extract and load data from relational databases, such as MySQL and Oracle, into Hadoop for analysis. Sqoop is useful for integrating Hadoop with existing data sources and sinks.\n10. Apache Oozie: Oozie is a workflow management system for Hadoop that provides coordination and management of Hadoop jobs. It allows users to define complex workflows, such as data processing pipelines, data integration jobs, and data quality checks, and ensures that they are executed in the correct order and at the right time. Oozie integrates with other Hadoop components, such as MapReduce, Pig, and Hive.", "shortest_response": "Hadoop is an open-source framework for big data processing that consists of several key components, each of which plays a crucial role in managing, storing, and processing large data sets in a distributed and highly scalable manner. Here's an overview of the key components of Hadoop:\n\n1. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS): HDFS is the primary storage system for Hadoop, which provides a distributed and scalable file system for storing large files. Data in HDFS is broken down into smaller units called blocks, and each block is replicated across multiple nodes in the cluster to improve fault tolerance.\n\n2. MapReduce: MapReduce is a programming model and software library that is used for processing large data sets in parallel across multiple nodes in a Hadoop cluster. The MapReduce jobs are split into parallel mappers and reduce tasks, which are executed on various nodes to process data and produce the final output.\n\n3. YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator): YARN is the resource management component of Hadoop that replaces the previous Hadoop MapReduce Resource Manager. YARN provides a flexible resource management architecture, allowing it to manage multiple frameworks (such as MapReduce, Spark, and Tez) simultaneously.\n\n4. Hadoop Common: Hadoop Common is a set of utilities and libraries that provide basic services and functions for the other components of Hadoop, such as security, network communication, and naming service support.\n\n5. Hadoop Ambari: Ambari is a web-based tool that streamlines the installation, configuration, and management of Apache Hadoop clusters, making it easier for administrators to monitor and manage clusters with minimal effort.\n\n6. Hive, Pig, and Impala: These are data warehousing and SQL-like querying tools that allow users to perform SQL-like queries directly on the data stored in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) while Hadoop MapReduce processes complex data processing.\n\nEach of these components works together to provide a powerful and flexible big data processing platform for handling a wide range of data-intensive applications.", "input_size": 13, "output_sizes": [480, 482, 475, 806, 517, 541, 554, 554, 567, 886], "output_mean": 586.2, "output_std": 134.9, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 490.75, "p50": 547.5, "p75": 563.75, "p99": 878.8}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "open_qa", "gen_time": 21.44651}, {"sample_id": "abf6d0226c28e0a7", "prompt_id": "b90b6657e156de7b", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Where can I find a bristly bellflower in the wild?\nContext: Campanula cervicaria, also known as the bristly bellflower, is a species of flowering plant in the bellflower family, Campanulaceae.

However, some common choices for the flex position are:\n\n1. Running Back (RB): In PPR leagues, running backs often accumulate points through receptions, which can make them valuable options for the flex spot. Additionally, some running backs play in high-scoring offenses and may receive a larger share of their team's total points due to their versatility.\n\n2. Wide Receiver (WR): Wide receivers can also be strong flex options, depending on their team's passing game and their statistical production. In PPR leagues, a receiver with a high number of receptions can provide a consistent source of points.\n\n3. Tight End (TE): While tight ends can be inconsistent, a top-tier player at this position can be a valuable asset in your flex spot. Some fantasy football platforms heavily weight touchdowns, in which case a tight end with a history of finding the end zone can be a smart choice. In PPR leagues, pass-catching tight ends can also earn points through receptions.\n\n4. Flex-ible: In some cases, it may make sense to use a player from a position other than running back, wide receiver, or tight end in the flex slot. For example, if you have a strong starting lineup at RB and WR but have a weaker TE, you might consider starting a top-scoring defense or kicker in the flex spot to maximize your overall team scoring.\n\nUltimately, the best position to use in the flex slot will depend on the specific players and matchups in your league. A popular strategy is to rank players at all eligible positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, DEF, and K) and select the highest-ranked player available, regardless of position.

Build the Wings:\n\n   - Using templates, cut out wing shapes from cardboard and reinforce them with duct tape.\n   - Attach wing supports made from dowels, balsa wood, or bamboo skewers to the undersides of the wings.\n   - Connect the wings to the fuselage using strips of duct tape or by attaching them to supports inside the fuselage.\n\n5. Add Finishing Touches:\n\n   - Create and attach a vertical stabilizer (fin) to the rear of the fuselage to assist with directional control.\n   - Paint the aircraft, applying colorful patterns and designs as desired.\n   - Attach a simple cockpit for display using cardboard and duct tape.\n\n6.

Regular Exercise: Dogs require regular exercise, such as walks, runs, or playtimes, which helps their owners maintain a consistent exercise routine. According to research published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), dog owners are more likely to meet the recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week compared to those without dogs.\n\n2. Increased Social Interaction: Dog walking often leads to more social interactions with other people, fostering a sense of community and support. This enhanced social bonding can improve mental and physical wellbeing, reducing feelings of loneliness and stress.\n\n3. Lower Blood Pressure: Regular exercise, combined with the stress-reducing effects of pet ownership, can lead to lower blood pressure and improved cardiovascular health. A study published in the Journal of Human Hypertension found that owning a dog may lower blood pressure in people with high blood pressure, particularly during times of stress.\n\n4. Improved Mood: The companionship provided by dogs can help reduce feelings of anxiety and improve overall mood. The release of feel-good hormones like oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine during interactions with dogs can boost the immune system and help alleviate symptoms of depression.\n\n5. Enhanced Sense of Purpose: Taking care of a pet, particularly a dog, gives people a sense of responsibility and purpose. This can lead to an increased sense of self-worth and improved self-confidence, which in turn can contribute to better physical health.\n\n6. Accountability: Dogs require a consistent feeding and walking schedule, which can help promote healthy habits in their owners, such as regular meal times and maintaining a routine. These habits can positively impact overall health and wellbeing.\n\nWhile cats can offer mental health benefits and companionship, they generally require less physical exercise and interaction compared to dogs. However, that doesn't mean they can't contribute to their owners' physical health in other ways, such as encouraging active play or stimulating the mind during games of hide-and-seek or solving puzzles. Ultimately, the decision to choose a pet should be based on personal preferences, lifestyle, and the specific needs of the individual.", "shortest_response": "While it's important to note that both cats and dogs can provide companionship and emotional benefits, there are some ways that dogs, and particularly active dog breeds, might have a slightly greater impact on a person's physical health. Here are a few reasons:\n\n1. Regular exercise: Dogs require daily walks and playtime, which can encourage their owners to incorporate a physical activity into their daily routine. This might lead to increased levels of physical exercise compared to those who only have indoor pets, such as cats.\n\n2. Socialization: Dogs often require more social interaction, both with their owners and other dogs, which can help reduce feelings of loneliness and provide additional opportunities for physical activity.\n\n3. Lower risk of cardiovascular disease: Studies have shown that dog owners tend to have lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels compared to non-dog owners, which may contribute to a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. This is attributed to the physical activity and stress reduction that comes from dog ownership.\n\n4. Immunity boost: Interacting with pets can help strengthen a person's immune system.

Here are some key principles for effective parenting:\n\n1. Love and acceptance: Children need to feel loved, understood, and accepted by their parents. This enables them to grow into confident and well-rounded individuals.\n\n2. Consistency: Establishing clear rules and expectations helps children feel secure and understand the boundaries that govern their behavior. Consistently enforcing these rules builds trust and respect in the parent-child relationship.\n\n3. Open communication: Encourage open dialogue, active listening, and empathy with your children. This helps them feel comfortable expressing their thoughts, feelings, and concerns, and fosters a strong emotional bond between parent and child.\n\n4. Positive reinforcement: Reward children for positive and appropriate behaviors, rather than just punishing them for negative ones. This instills a sense of achievement and encourages children to repeat positive behaviors.\n\n5. Modeling: Children learn by observing and imitating the adults in their lives. Parents should strive to model the behavior they want their children to emulate, including demonstrating kindness, honesty, and resilience.\n\n6. Empowerment and encouragement: Support your children's efforts, celebrate their achievements, and allow them the freedom to make age-appropriate decisions to build their self-confidence and independence.\n\n7. Respect and understanding: It's essential to treat children with respect and take their feelings seriously, even as they grow older. Encourage them to develop empathy and compassion for others as well.\n\n8. Patience and flexibility: Parenting requires patience and the ability to adapt to each child's unique needs, personality, and pace of development.\n\n9. Balance: Strive for a balanced approach to parenting that considers your child's physical, emotional, social, and intellectual well-being. This includes supporting their educational and extracurricular interests, as well as providing opportunities for rest, relaxation, and play.\n\n10. Self-care: Effective parenting is not only about supporting your child's growth; it's also about taking care of yourself. This includes setting boundaries, practicing mindfulness, spending time with other adults, and seeking help when needed to maintain your own physical, emotional, and mental health.", "shortest_response": "As a responsible and respectful assistant, I refrain from expressing personal views on topics like parenting. However, I can provide some general suggestions based on various researches and recommendations from child development experts:\n\n1. Consistency: Children thrive on structure and routine.

It helps children express their feelings, ask questions, and build strong relationships.\n\n3. Empathy: Showing empathy towards children's feelings can help them develop emotional intelligence. It also builds trust and strengthens the parent-child bond.\n\n4. Positive Reinforcement: Acknowledging and rewarding good behavior encourages children to repeat it. Criticism should be constructive and focused on changing behavior rather than attacking the child.\n\n5. Encourage Independence: Allowing children to make age-appropriate decisions and solve problems on their own fosters independence and resilience.\n\n6. Quality Time: Spending quality time with your child shows them that they are important and valued. This could include playing games, reading together, or just having a conversation.\n\n7. Education: Teaching children about the world around them, including values, morals, and social skills, helps them grow into well-rounded individuals.\n\n8. Role Modeling: Children learn by observing.

Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995, Vapnik et al., 1997[citation needed]) SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods, being based on statistical learning frameworks or VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974). Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n\nIn addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\nThe support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data.[citation needed] These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data to groups and, then, to map new data according to these clusters.", "longest_response": "Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression analysis.

To build this model, SVM maps the training data points to various points in a higher-dimensional space to maximize the distance (or 'gap') between the two categories. Subsequently, new data points are also mapped into that same space, and are predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n\nOne of the key advantages of SVM is its ability to perform non-linear classification using the kernel trick, which implicitly maps the inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. This allows SVM to classify data that may not follow a straightforward linear correlation.\n\nIn addition to the binary linear classifier, SVM can also be extended to handle multi-class classification problems.

Here are some of the reasons:\n\n1. Connections can loosen over time: Aluminum wire expands and contracts more than copper wire, especially when the electricity is turned on and off. This extra movement can cause the connections to loosen, leading to arcing, overheating, and potential fires.\n\n2. Arcing: When connections loosen and the circuit is active, sparks (arcing) can occur. Arcing can lead to insulation damage, overheating, and fires.\n\n3. Higher resistance: Aluminum has higher electrical resistance compared to copper, which can generate more heat that could potentially lead to fires.\n\n4. Compatibility issues: Some devices and receptacles cannot accommodate aluminum wiring or are designed for copper. When aluminum wire is used with improper devices, it can cause overheating, safety concerns, and fire hazards.\n\n5. Solder vs. screw connections: Older aluminum wiring systems were often connected using solder, which isn't as reliable as modern crimp connectors and can lead to loose connections over time.\n\n6. Increased risk of shock: Since aluminum conducts electricity less efficiently than copper, there may be a higher risk of shock with aluminum wiring, particularly in poorly maintained systems.\n\nWhile aluminum wiring is not inherently dangerous, it's important to have it inspected and properly maintained to minimize these risks and ensure your home remains safe. If you have aluminum wiring in your home, it's recommended that a qualified electrician performs a thorough inspection. They can identify any issues, make necessary repairs, and provide recommendations for upgrades if needed.", "shortest_response": "Aluminum wiring in a home can be dangerous for several reasons:\n\n1. High Resistance: Aluminum wire has a higher electrical resistance compared to the common copper wire. This means the same amount of current (amperage) requires a higher voltage to travel through aluminum wire, leading to excessive heat generation at the outlet or device, which can potentially lead to fires.\n\n2. Poor Connection: Aluminum expands and contracts at a higher rate than copper when subjected to temperature changes. This can loosen connections over time, leading to arcing (sparks), overheating, and potential fires.\n\n3. Compatibility Issues: Aluminum wiring is not always compatible with older electrical boxes and devices designed for copper wire. The connections may not make good contact, leading to the issues mentioned above.\n\n4. Incorrect Installation: If aluminum wiring was installed improperly, the risks can be even greater. For example, if the right type of connectors are not used, or if the wiring is not stripped properly, the chances of electrical failures increase.\n\nFor safety reasons, homes with aluminum wiring may need to be rewired or have their connections upgraded to minimize these risks.

He later served as America's first ambassadorr to the United Kingdom during the 1780s.\n\nAdams' political career continued to advance when he was chosen as George Washington's vice president for Washington's first two terms in office, from 1789 to 1797. In this role, Adams established many important precedents, including the notion that the vice presidency is an active, rather than just ceremonial, position.\n\nIn 1796, Adams defeated Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and others to become the second president of the United States. During his presidency, he focused on domestic economic policies, foreign relations, and the implementation of various constitutional principles.

The term \"head\" originates from the tradition of rows being held in the winter months, under adverse weather conditions such as fog (mist or \"head\") where visibility could be poor.\n\nIn a head race, crews start at regular intervals - typically between 10 to 20 seconds - and row as a procession along a pre-defined course. They are timed individually over the fixed distance, with the objective being to complete the race in the shortest time possible. Head courses can vary in length, typically between 2,000 meters (1.24 miles) and 12,000 meters (7.46 miles), with longer races such as the Boston Rowing Marathon and shorter events such as Pairs Head also being common.\n\nDue to the individual starting and timed nature of head races, competitors cannot race head-to-head and must rely on their own pacing and technique to post the fastest time possible. This presents a unique mental and physical challenge for rowers, as they must maintain focus and effort while racing primarily against themselves.\n\nThese types of races often require a high degree of skill and strategy, as crews must navigate around any obstacles in the water and make efficient decisions regarding their pacing strategy over the given distance.

Here are some factors to consider when comparing NYC to other U.S. cities:\n\n1. Size and Population: NYC is one of the most populous cities in the U.S., with over 8.3 million residents, and has a dense urban environment. This is significantly larger than other major cities such as Los Angeles (3.9 million) and Chicago (2.7 million). Consequently, you may find that living in NYC can feel more crowded, and you will have easier access to various amenities, cultural attractions, and job opportunities.\n\n2. Culture and Diversity: NYC is often dubbed the world's cultural capital because of its vast array of cultural institutions, museums, art galleries, and performing arts venues. The city is also renowned for its ethnic diversity, with residents from various nationalities, religions, and backgrounds living side by side. This rich cultural blend results in a vibrant and dynamic atmosphere that is difficult to find in other U.S. cities.\n\n3. Cost of Living: NYC has a higher cost of living compared to many other U.S. cities, with expensive housing, rent, and utilities. The median home price in NYC is around $630,000, while the median rental price hovers around $3,000 per month for a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan. Groceries, transportation, and entertainment also tend to be costlier in NYC.\n\n4. Public Transportation: NYC's public transportation system\u2014Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)\u2014is one of the most extensive and efficient in the U.S. With a subway system, buses, and commuter trains, it is often possible to navigate the city without a car. This convenience can save residents time and money, although it may come with higher commute times during peak hours.\n\n5. Pace of Life: NYC is known for its fast-paced and demanding lifestyle. The city never sleeps, with various activities happening around the clock, and job opportunities often requiring long hours and weekends. For some, this bustling environment can be exciting and energizing, while others may find it overwhelming and stressful.\n\n6. Job Market: NYC offers many job opportunities in fields such as finance, media, technology, healthcare, and education. The city is home to numerous renowned companies, organizations, and institutions, making it an attractive destination for job seekers. However, competition for positions can be fierce, and the cost of living may put a financial strain on residents.\n\n7. Weather: NYC's climate can be challenging for some, with hot and humid summers and frigid winters. Snowstorms and blizzards can lead to frequent disruptions in public transportation and daily activities, while the heat and humidity can make summers oppressive.\n\nIn summary, living in NYC offers a unique blend of cultural experiences, job opportunities, and conveniences that are difficult to find in other U.S. cities. However, the city's high cost of living, fast-paced lifestyle, and challenging weather can be difficult for some to adapt to. If you enjoy diversity, have a strong financial foundation, and are comfortable with a fast-paced environment, NYC may be an excellent choice for you. If you prefer a slower pace of life, lower costs, and a more relaxed atmosphere, other U.S. cities may be more suitable for you.", "shortest_response": "Living in New York City (NYC) is a unique and dynamic experience that contrasts significantly with many other US cities. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. Population Density: NYC has one of the highest population densities of any city in the United States. The subway system is often used as a primary mode of transportation due to the congestion on the streets. This can lead to a faster pace of life and a greater degree of anonymity compared to less population-dense cities.\n\n2. Diversity: NYC is often referred to as a \"melting pot\" due to its rich cultural diversity. You can find a myriad of ethnic neighborhoods, cultures, and cuisines throughout the city. The diversity also extends to the arts, music, and fashion scenes.\n\n3. Cost of Living: NYC is generally more expensive than many other US cities. Rent, food, and living expenses can be higher due to the high demand and limited supply of housing in the city. However, salaries tend to be higher as well to account for the cost of living.\n\n4. Opportunities: NYC offers numerous opportunities in various fields, particularly in finance, media, art, and technology. The presence of leading institutions, businesses, and organizations attracts a large number of professionals and students.\n\n5. Nightlife and Entertainment: NYC is famous for its vibrant nightlife and entertainment options. There are countless bars, restaurants, clubs, and theaters to choose from, as well as numerous cultural events and festivals throughout the year.\n\n6. Safety: Safety can vary greatly depending on the specific neighborhood you live in or visit.

Increased Yield: Genetically modified (GM) crops are often engineered to have higher yields. For example, Bt cotton produces more cotton fibers per plant, increasing the amount of cotton grown on a single acre.\n\n2. Resistance to Pests: GM crops are developed to resist pests. For instance, Bt corn and cotton have been genetically engineered to produce a toxin that kills certain insects causing damage to the crops. This results in reduced pesticide usage and lower costs for farmers.\n\n3. Reduced Pesticide Use: By producing their own pesticide, GM crops can significantly reduce the amount of chemical pesticides needed in agricultural production. This can lead to fewer health risks for farmers and farm workers, as well as fewer hazards for the environment.\n\n4. Drought Resistance: Some GM crops, particularly corn and soybeans, have been engineered to withstand drier conditions. This makes them more resilient in areas prone to drought and improves agricultural productivity in marginal environments.\n\n5. Improved Nutrition: Some GM crops have been developed to produce more nutritious food. For example, GM golden rice has increased levels of beta-carotene, which can help combat vitamin A deficiency in developing countries.\n\n6. Reduced Costs: By reducing the need for pesticides, increasing yield, and making crops more resilient to weather conditions, GM crops can help lower overall production costs for farmers, potentially benefiting consumers through lower food prices.\n\n7. Economic Development: In some developing countries, GM crops can contribute to economic development by improving food security and providing farmers with an opportunity to increase their incomes. For example, Vietnam has seen substantial growth in its cotton sector due to the adoption of Bt cotton.\n\n8. Conservation: By reducing the need for intensive farming practices such as tilling and increased pesticide use, GM crops can contribute to environmental conservation efforts. For instance, reduced tillage can lead to improved soil health and lower greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n9. Food Waste Reduction: By producing crops that are more resistant to pests and diseases and maintain quality during storage, GM crops can help reduce food waste at the farm level.\n\n10. Genetic Diversity: The development of GM crops can help preserve genetic diversity within crop species by allowing farmers to grow varieties that are well-adapted to local conditions but may be vulnerable to pests or diseases. For example, the release of GM cotton in India has allowed farmers to phase out less sustainable traditional cotton varieties, helping to conserve valuable genetic resources.", "shortest_response": "1.

This not only lowers production costs but also decreases environmental impact and potential health risks associated with pesticide use.\n\n3. Tolerance to Herbicides: Some GM crops are designed to be resistant to certain herbicides, allowing farmers to use more effective weed control methods without harming their crops. This can lead to increased productivity and reduced use of harmful chemicals.\n\n4. Nutritional Enhancement: certain GM crops have been developed to produce higher levels of essential nutrients, such as vitamin A, iron, and zinc, which can help address malnutrition in areas where these nutrients are lacking in local diets.\n\n5. Reduced Agricultural Waste: Some GM crops are engineered to produce less waste, such as fewer seeds or reduced water consumption. This can make agriculture more sustainable and efficient.\n\n6. Climate Resilience: Some GM crops have been developed to perform better under adverse climate conditions, such as drought and extreme temperatures.

Here's a summary of the main differences:\n\n1. Funding:\nPublic schools are primarily funded by a combination of local, state, and federal government revenues. Although they may receive donations or grants, these sources are typically minimal and do not drive the main funding of the school. In contrast, private schools are funded by tuition fees paid by students' families and donations or grants from various sources, like individuals, businesses, or foundations.\n\n2. Governance:\nPublic schools are overseen by local, state, and national government agencies, usually through an appointed or elected school board. This board establishes school policies, hires personnel, and sets the budget. In contrast, private schools are typically managed by a board of trustees or administrators appointed by the board or sponsoring organization.\n\n3. Curriculum and regulations:\nPublic schools must follow state-mandated curricula, standardized testing requirements, and policies regarding student enrollment, eligibility, and rights. Private schools have more freedom to design their own curricula, set their own testing policies, and determine their own enrollment criteria, although they may also choose to follow state guidelines if they wish.\n\n4. Tuition and fees:\nPublic schools are tuition-free and do not charge fees for enrollment, with the exception of some optional activities or materials. Private schools charge tuition fees, which may vary based on the school's location, resources, and reputation. Many private schools offer financial aid to families with financial need.\n\n5. Teacher certification and salary:\nPublic schools are required to hire teachers who are certified and meet specific education and licensing requirements for each subject taught. Teacher salaries in public schools can vary based on factors like experience and education level, but are subject to collective bargaining agreements and other labor regulations. Private schools have more flexibility in hiring teachers, but they may not be required to have the same level of certification or education. Private school teachers are generally not covered by the same labor regulations as public school teachers.\n\n6. Student diversity:\nThe student body in public schools is generally more diverse in terms of socioeconomic background, race, ethnicity, and other demographics, as these schools are open to all students within their district. Since private schools charge tuition, they often have a more affluent student body. However, some private schools offer scholarships or financial aid to help make education more accessible for students from diverse backgrounds.\n\n7. Extra-curricular activities:\nPublic schools often provide a wider range of extracurricular activities, such as sports teams, clubs, and performing arts groups, since these programs are sponsored by taxpayer funds. Private schools may offer a more focused selection of extracurricular activities or specialized programs aimed at particular interests or talents.\n\n8. Class sizes:\nClass sizes in public schools can vary, but they are often larger due to a combination of funding constraints and the need to serve a large student population. In contrast, private schools have smaller class sizes, providing a more personalized learning experience for students.\n\nOverall, the choice between public and private schools will depend on various factors, such as the educational philosophy, budget, location, and desired lifestyle of the child's family, as well as the child's academic and social needs.

List in the format {name} - {year} in a semicolon list.\nContext: Radiohead are an English rock band formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.\n\nRadiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in 1993. Their debut single, \"Creep\", became a worldwide hit. Radiohead's popularity and critical standing rose with the release of The Bends in 1995. Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music.\n\nRadiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though Kid A divided listeners, it was later named the best album of the decade by multiple outlets. It was followed by Amnesiac (2001), recorded in the same sessions. Hail to the Thief (2003), with lyrics addressing the War on Terror, blended the band's rock and electronic sides, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI.\n\nRadiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway, and O'Brien have released solo albums; in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.\n\nBy 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart: \"Creep\" (1992), \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" (1996), \"Paranoid Android\" (1997), \"Karma Police\" (1997), \"No Surprises\" (1998), \"Pyramid Song\" (2001), and \"There There\" (2003). \"Creep\" and \"Nude\" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Rolling Stone named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and Rolling Stone readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s.

Physical Contact: Cats use physical contact to show affection, establish hierarchy, or claim territory. This includes grooming each other, head butting, and curling up together.\n\n6. Spraying: Male cats may spray urine to mark their territory. These smelly, strong-smelling urine signals will tell other cats that the territory is occupied and to stay away.\n\n7.

It is an example of cannibalization.\nThe term alludes to the Osborne Computer Corporation, whose second product did not become available until more than a year after it was announced. The company's subsequent bankruptcy was widely blamed on reduced sales after the announcement.\nThe Osborne Effect states that prematurely discussing future, unavailable products damages sales of existing products. The name comes from the planned replacement of the Osborne 1, an early personal computer first sold by the Osborne Computer Corporation in 1981. In 1983, founder Adam Osborne pre-announced several next-generation computer models (the Osborne Executive and Osborne Vixen), which were only prototypes, highlighting the fact that they would outperform the existing model as the prototypes dramatically cut down assembly time. A widely held belief was that sales of the Osborne 1 fell sharply as customers anticipated those more advanced systems, leading to a sales decline from which Osborne Computer was unable to recover. This belief appeared in the media almost immediately after the company's September 1983 bankruptcy:\n\nTo give the jazzy $2,495 Osborne Executive a running start, Adam began orchestrating publicity early in 1983. We, along with many other magazines, were shown the machine in locked hotel rooms. We were required not to have anything in print about it until the planned release date in mid-April. As far as we know, nothing did appear in print, but dealers heard about the plans and cancelled orders for the Osborne 1 in droves. In early April, Osborne told dealers he would be showing them the machine on a one-week tour the week of 17 April, and emphasized that the new machine was not a competitor for the Osborne 1. But dealers didn't react the way Osborne expected; said Osborne, \"All of them just cancelled their orders for the Osborne 1.\"\n\nOsborne reacted by drastically cutting prices on the Osborne 1 in an effort to stimulate cash flow. But nothing seemed to work, and for several months sales were practically non-existent.\n\nPre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, with the revenue drop for the current product being offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available. However, when the Osborne effect occurs, the quantity of unsold goods increases and the company must react by discounting and/or lowering production of the current product, both of which depress cash flow.", "longest_response": "The passage does not provide a specific price for the Osborne 1.

This allows them to stay active and warm in a variety of environmental conditions.\n\n2. Hair or fur: Mammals have hair or fur covering their bodies, which provides insulation, making it easier for them to maintain their body temperature. Some mammals, such as whales, have tiny hairs on their skin, which may be difficult to see with the naked eye.\n\n3. Mammae: Mammals have mammae (mammary glands) that are specialized for lactation (milk production) to feed their young. Female mammals nurse their offspring for various periods, ranging from a few days to a few years, depending on the species.\n\n4. Four-chambered heart: Mammals have a heart that contains four chambers, which is more efficient in pumping oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.\n\n5. Three middle ear bones: Mammals have three small bones in their middle ear (the malleus, incus, and stapes) that amplify and transmit sound vibrations. This helps them hear more effectively.\n\nExamples of mammals include humans, cats, dogs, cows, elephants, and giraffes.

However, in normal lighting conditions, the presence of chlorophyll tends to overwhelm these other pigments. In situations where chlorophyll levels are not high enough, like undergrowth or in low-light plants, these other pigments can give the plant its color instead.\n\nIn short, plants are often green because chlorophyll is abundant in their cells and reflects green light the least, making it the dominant color we see.

Initially, we choose an initial guess x0 for the square root of the number n. A common initial guess is x0 = n/2.\n\n2. We then iteratively update our guess using the formula:\n\n   x\\_n+1 = (x\\_n + n/x\\_n) / 2\n\n3. As we increase n, the iteration converges to the exact square root of n.\n\nNow, let's show that this method converges using mathematical analysis. We can rewrite the formula slightly to make it easier to analyze:\n\n   x\\_n+1 - \u221an = (x\\_n - \u221an) \\* (1 - n/(x\\_n*\u221an)) / 2\n\n4. Square both sides of the equation:\n\n   (x\\_n+1 - \u221an)\u00b2 = (x\\_n - \u221an)\u00b2 \\* (1 - n/(x\\_n*\u221an))\u00b2 / 4\n\n5. Expand the squares:\n\n    x\\_n+1\u00b2 - 2*x\\_n+1*\u221an + \u221an\u00b2 = x\\_n\u00b2 - 2*x\\_n*\u221an + \u221an\u00b2 - (x\\_n*\u221an)\u00b2 \\* (n - 1)\u00b2 / (4 \\* x\\_n\u00b2)\n\n6. Rearrange the terms:\n\n    \u221an - x\\_n+1 = (x\\_n\u00b2 - \u221an\u00b2) \\* (n - 1)\u00b2 / (4 \\* x\\_n\u00b2 \\* (x\\_n + \u221an))\n\n7. Since we are trying to find the square root of a positive number, the left side of the equation should always be non-negative (x\\_n+1 \u2265 \u221an). From step 6, we see that the right side of the equation is a finite value, as it only involves the square roots of n and x\\_n, and these are always positive. Thus, the left and right sides of the equation are equal for all n > 0.\n\n8. Moreover, the right side of the equation is negative for x\\_0 > \u221an and non-negative for x\\_0 < \u221an. This means that if our initial guess x\\_0 > \u221an, the value of x\\_n+1 will be smaller than \u221an, and if our initial guess x\\_0 < \u221an, the value of x\\_n+1 will be larger than \u221an.\n\n9. By continuing the iteration process, the guess will alternate between being too large and too small, and eventually converge to the exact square root of n.\n\nIn summary, the divide and conquer method for computing square roots works because it is guaranteed to converge to the exact square root of a number, given an initial guess, by alternating between overestimating and underestimating the square root and gradually narrowing the error.", "shortest_response": "The divide and conquer method for computing square roots, also known as the Babylonian method, is an iterative approach that improves upon guessing a starting point (usually halfway between the number and 1) to find a better approximation of the square root.

Calculate the midpoint between the number and the current approximation.\n\n   i. Midpoint (m) = (number + approximation) / 2.\n\n   b. Compare the midpoint with the original number.\n\n   i. If m\u00b2 > number, subtract m - number / m from approximation.\n   ii. If m\u00b2 < number, add number / m - m from approximation.\n\n3. The final approximation is the square root of the given number (approximation\u00b2 \u2248 number).\n\nThis method works because it systematically narrows the gap between the approximation and the actual square root with each iteration.

The goal of process mining is to turn event data into insights and actions. Process mining is an integral part of data science, fueled by the availability of event data and the desire to improve processes.Process mining techniques use event data to show what people, machines, and organizations are really doing. Process mining provides novel insights that can be used to identify the executional path taken by operational processes and address their performance and compliance problems.\n\nProcess mining starts from event data. Input for process mining is an event log. An event log views a process from a particular angle. Each event in the log should contain (1) a unique identifier for a particular process instance (called case id), (2) an activity (description of the event that is occurring), and (3) a timestamp. There may be additional event attributes referring to resources, costs, etc., but these are optional. With some effort, such data can be extracted from any information system supporting operational processes. Process mining uses these event data to answer a variety of process-related questions.", "longest_response": "Process mining is a data science technique used to analyze and enhance the understanding of operational processes based on collected event data.

Additional event attributes, such as resource or cost information, can be included as well, although they are optional. By analyzing event data, process mining can answer a range of questions related to process performance and compliance.\n\nSome key benefits of process mining include:\n\n1. Discovering the actual process: Process mining can help identify the true sequence of activities in a process, even if it deviates from the intended process model.\n2. Identifying bottlenecks and performance issues: Process mining can help uncover performance problems, such as long wait times, inefficient task sequences, or repetitive tasks.\n3. Enhancing compliance: Process mining can help validate if processes are being followed according to defined standards or regulations, which can help improve compliance and reduce risk.\n4. Supporting process improvement: By providing insights into the execution of operational processes, process mining can support organizations in identifying opportunities for improvement.\n\nIn summary, process mining is a valuable technique for process analysis and improvement, as it enables the exploration of the actual process execution, rather than relying on preconceived notions or assumptions.", "shortest_response": "Process mining is a data-driven approach used to analyze and understand the execution of business processes based on event logs, which contain traces of process instances with details such as case identifier, activity, and timestamp.

Set clear objectives and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Before starting any marketing campaign, it's essential to define what success looks like for your business. Set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals, such as increasing website traffic, generating leads, or boosting sales. Then, identify the KPIs that align with these objectives, such as click-through rates, conversion rates, cost per acquisition (CPA), or return on ad spend (ROAS).\n\n2. Integrate your marketing efforts: Ensure that your marketing channels are seamlessly integrated, allowing you to track user behavior across different platforms. This is crucial for understanding the customer journey and attributing sales to the right marketing activities. Use tools like Google Analytics, HubSpot, or a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to connect data from your website, social media, email marketing, and advertising campaigns.\n\n3. Track and measure KPIs consistently: Regularly monitor and compare your KPIs to see how they evolve over time. This will help you identify trends, discover what works, and make data-driven decisions about your marketing strategy. Set up automated reports to make the process easier and more time-efficient.\n\n4. Perform regular analyses: Analyze your marketing data periodically to gain insights into the performance of your campaigns. Look at the following aspects:\n   a. Channel performance: Understand which channels are driving the most traffic, leads, and sales, and which ones are not performing well.\n   b. Campaign performance: Assess the effectiveness of your individual marketing campaigns by comparing their KPIs to your overall objectives and benchmarks.\n   c. Audience segmentation: Break down your data by demographics, geography, interests, or behavior to better understand who your customers are and how they interact with your brand.\n   d. Funnel analysis: Analyze the conversion rates at various stages of the marketing funnel (awareness, consideration, and decision stages) to identify bottlenecks and optimize your strategy.\n   e. Cost analysis: Compare the costs associated with your marketing activities, such as advertising spend, content creation, and tools, to ensure that your campaigns are cost-effective and generating enough revenue.\n\n5.

As the largest optical telescope in space, it is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars, the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.\n\nThe U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led JWST's design and development and partnered with two main agencies: the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Maryland managed telescope development, while the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore on the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University currently operates JWST. The primary contractor for the project was Northrop Grumman. The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana, and arrived at the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point in January 2022. The first JWST image was released to the public via a press conference on 11 July 2022.\n\nJWST's primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated beryllium, which combined create a 6.5-meter-diameter (21 ft) mirror, compared with Hubble's 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). This gives JWST a light-collecting area of about 25 square meters, about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet and visible (0.1 to 0.8 \u03bcm), and near infrared (0.8\u20132.5 \u03bcm) spectra, JWST observes a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light (red) through mid-infrared (0.6\u201328.3 \u03bcm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below 50 K (\u2212223 \u00b0C; \u2212370 \u00b0F), such that the infrared light emitted by the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. It is deployed in a solar orbit near the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point, about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 mi) from Earth, where its five-layer sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\n\nInitial designs for the telescope, then named the Next Generation Space Telescope, began in 1996.

Equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, it is designed to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope, enabling investigations in various fields of astronomy and cosmology. The telescope was named after James E. Webb, an administrator of NASA during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.\n\nLaunched on December 25, 2021, and arriving at the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrange point in January 2022, JWST has a primary mirror of 18 hexagonal segments made of gold-plated beryllium, forming a 6.5-meter-diameter mirror, larger than Hubble's. This enhanced capability allows JWST to collect significantly more light, about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, JWST operates in the lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light to mid-infrared. To maintain the required cold temperature, the telescope is deployed at a distance of 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, where a five-layer sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\n\nThe JWST project faced cost overruns and delays since its initial designs in 1996. A major redesign in 2005 led to the current approach, and construction was completed in 2016 at a total cost of US$10 billion.

Revenue and expense should be kept separate from personal expenses.\nGoing Concern: assumes that the business will be in operation indefinitely. This validates the methods of asset capitalization, depreciation, and amortization. Only when liquidation is certain this assumption is not applicable. The business will continue to exist in the unforeseeable future.\nMonetary Unit principle: assumes a stable currency is going to be the unit of record. The FASB accepts the nominal value of the US Dollar as the monetary unit of record unadjusted for inflation.\nTime-period principle: implies that the economic activities of an enterprise can be divided into artificial time periods.\nPrinciples\nHistorical cost principle: requires companies to account and report assets and liabilities acquisition costs rather than fair market value. This principle provides information that is reliable (removing opportunity to provide subjective and potentially biased market values), but not very relevant. Thus there is a trend to use fair values. Most debts and securities are now reported at market values.\nRevenue recognition principle: holds that companies should record revenue when earned but not when received. The flow of cash does not have any bearing on the recognition of revenue. This is the essence of accrual basis accounting. Conversely, however, losses must be recognized when their occurrence becomes probable, whether or not it has actually occurred. This comports with the constraint of conservatism, yet brings it into conflict with the constraint of consistency, in that reflecting revenues/gains is inconsistent with the way in which losses are reflected.\nMatching principle: expenses have to be matched with revenues as long as it is reasonable to do so. Expenses are recognized not when the work is performed, or when a product is produced, but when the work or the product actually makes its contribution to revenue. Only if no connection with revenue can be established, cost may be charged as expenses to the current period (e.g., office salaries and other administrative expenses). This principle allows greater evaluation of actual profitability and performance (shows how much was spent to earn revenue). Depreciation and Cost of Goods Sold are good examples of application of this principle.\nFull disclosure principle: Amount and kinds of information disclosed should be decided based on trade-off analysis as a larger amount of information costs more to prepare and use. Information disclosed should be enough to make a judgment while keeping costs reasonable. Information is presented in the main body of financial statements, in the notes or as supplementary information\nConstraints\nObjectivity principle: The company financial statements provided by the accountants should be based on objective evidence.\nMateriality principle: The significance of an item should be considered when it is reported. An item is considered significant when it would affect the decision of a reasonable individual.\nConsistency principle: The company uses the same accounting principles and methods from period to period.\nConservatism principle: When choosing between two solutions, the one which has the less favorable outcome is the solution which should be chosen (see convention of conservatism)\nCost Constraint: The benefits of reporting financial information should justify and be greater than the costs imposed on supplying it.", "longest_response": "The four basic principles of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) are:\n\n1.

Hard Cheese: As long as the cheese was initially kept at a proper refrigerated temperature (40\u00b0F or below) and it has been kept between 70\u00b0F and 80\u00b0F for the six days you were away.

Jar of Olives: As long as the jar was initially kept refrigerated and the olives were kept at room temperature for six days, they should be safe to eat. Storing canned or jarred olives in the refrigerator after opening is recommended to prolong their shelf life.\n\n3. Fruit Jelly: If initially refrigerated and kept at room temperature for six days, fruit jelly is likely still safe to consume. However, check for any signs of mold or off-odors. Unopened, commercial fruit jellies have a shelf life of up to 2 years when refrigerated and up to 1 year at room temperature.\n\nAs for the perishable items like raw chicken and milk, it's crucial to remember that they are potential health hazards when not refrigerated.\n\n1. Raw Chicken: The ideal temperature for storing raw chicken in the refrigerator is 40\u00b0F or lower. If raw chicken was stored at room temperature for six days, it can potentially become contaminated by bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, and Campylobacter jejuni, which can cause foodborne illness. Cooked chicken leftovers can also be contaminated and should be discarded if not refrigerated for more than 2 hours.\n\n2. Milk: Milk is a perishable item that should always be kept refrigerated. It can support bacterial growth at temperatures within the recommended ranges for refrigeration, leading to spoilage or foodborne illness when not refrigerated. It's generally safe to keep opened milk for about 5-7 days in the refrigerator, but this can be shorter depending on the type of milk and its acidity. If milk has spoiled or become contaminated, it will have a distinct odor, off-flavor, or curdled appearance. If the milk was left out for more than two hours at room temperature, it should be discarded to prevent foodborne illness.\n\nIt is recommended to discard any perishable food items, such as raw chicken and milk, that have been stored at room temperature for an extended period.

Choose the right beginner slope: Start on a gentle, wide-open beginner slope, ideally with a slow ski lift or an uphill moving walk.\n\n3. Learn the basics:\n   - Ski posture: Stand up straight with your hips, knees, and ankles slightly bent, chin parallel to the ground, and your arms out in front to maintain balance.\n   - Snowplow: Beginners should start with the classic \"snowplow\" stance \u2013 point the toes inward and keep your ski tips parallel to form a wide V shape.\n   - Pole plant: Plant your poles alternately, parallel to your feet, to help you turn and maintain balance.\n   - Slowing down: Lean back slightly to wedge your skis and use your edges to create drag, or try \"pizza\" turns for more control.\n   - Stopping: Once you know how to slow down, practice stopping by making short, wide turns and gradually bringing your skis to a halt.\n\n4. Take lessons: Sign up for a beginner lesson at a ski school. Experienced instructors can provide valuable guidance, correct your technique, and give you drills to practice.\n\n5. Practice regularly: Consistency is key in learning to ski, so make time for regular skiing sessions.\n\n6. Develop your skills: As you become more comfortable, start exploring blue and green runs to improve your turns, speed control, and confidence.\n\n7. Learn to link turns: Once you're able to make controlled turns on gentle slopes, aim to link them together to move smoothly down the mountain.\n\n8. Consider advanced techniques: Once you've mastered the basics, consider taking lessons to learn more advanced skills like carving, parallel skiing, moguls, or off-piste skiing.\n\n9.

Make sure the equipment fits you properly.\n\n3. **Dress appropriately**: Wear layers, so you can adjust to comfort levels as you heat up or cool down. Waterproof and windproof outer layers, ski socks, gloves or mittens, and a hat are essential.\n\n4. **Learn the basics**:\n\n   - **Snowplow**: This is the most basic skiing position. Keep your legs and knees bent, and bring your heels together, creating a V-shape with your skis.\n\n   - **Pole planting**: Plant your pole parallel to the ski run about one pole length in front of your inside ski to help balance and turn.\n\n   - **Snowplow stop**: To stop, widen your stance, point your toes in, and apply equal pressure to both edges of your skis.\n\n5. **Practice**: Spend time practicing on the beginner slopes. Don't rush. The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become.\n\n6. **Advance when ready**: As you gain confidence, consider moving to steeper slopes or joining an advanced lesson if available.\n\n7. **Safety first**: Always follow the resort's safety regulations.

It can also significantly improve muscle recovery following exercise by reducing the levels of blood lactate concentration. For any injury presenting with palpable swelling and heat, and visible redness - such as a strain/sprain - contrast baths are contraindicated during the acute inflammation stage. Acute inflammation begins at the time of injury and lasts for approximately 72 hours.", "longest_response": "Contrast therapy is primarily used for managing pain, reducing inflammation, and promoting recovery from injuries and exercise. It works by alternating between hot and cold immersions in water or using hot and cold packs.\n\n1. Reducing swelling: Contrast therapy can help decrease the swelling around injuries, which can ease discomfort and promote healing.\n\n2. Enhancing circulation: The alternating hot and cold temperatures can stimulate blood flow, which may help remove waste products from the affected area and speed up the healing process.\n\n3. Pain relief: Hot and cold temperatures can help manage pain by constricting and dilating blood vessels, respectively. Hot therapy can help relax muscles and relieve tension, while cold therapy can numb the area and reduce pain.\n\n4. Recovery from exercise: Contrast bathing, particularly with cold water, can help reduce muscle soreness and speed up recovery after intense exercise. This is due to the cold therapy's effect on decreasing blood flow and reducing inflammation.\n\nHowever, it's essential to be careful in applying contrast therapy, especially during the acute inflammation stage (approximately 72 hours after an injury) as it can exacerbate swelling and potentially delay the healing process. In cases of visible swelling, redness, heat, or clear signs of injury, it's best to consult with a healthcare professional before using contrast therapy.

The therapy involves alternating between cold and warm water baths for a controlled period.\n\n1. Cold contrast bathing helps reduce swelling, pain, and inflammation by constricting blood vessels, reducing blood flow, and numbing nerve ending to control pain.\n\n2. Warm contrast bathing increases blood flow, brings nutrients to the injured area for healing, helps to relax muscles, and aids in flushing out waste products, like lactic acid.\n\nBy using a combination of hot and cold treatments, contrast therapy can help promote faster healing, reduce pain, and alleviate inflammation.

Her genre-spanning discography, songwriting abilities and artistic reinventions have received critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country artist to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.\nSwift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\nExiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021\u2014Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her 2022 album Midnights and single \"Anti-Hero\" broke all-time streaming records. Swift has directed music videos and films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and played supporting roles in others.\nHaving sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians in history. She is the most streamed woman on Spotify and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards; and 92 Guinness World Records. Swift has been featured in rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment.

Isn't it possible that the listener would associate \"pencil\" with \"wood\"? Maybe the listener would associate the word \"pencil\" with \"round\" instead (as pencils are, usually, in fact, round!). Wittgenstein writes regarding several possible \"interpretations\" which may arise after such a lesson. The student may interpret your pointing at a pencil and saying \"pencil\" to mean the following: (1) This is a pencil; (2) This is round; (3) This is wood; (4) This is one; (5) This is hard, etc., etc.", "longest_response": "Ludwig Wittgenstein, in his philosophy of language, argues that learning a language through ostensive definition (pointing and naming an object) is not enough to ensure a common understanding of words. He calls this the problem of \"private language\" and \"rule-following.\"\n\nWittgenstein highlights several issues:\n\n1. **Multiple interpretations**: As you mentioned, the listener may associate the word \"pencil\" with different properties, like \"round,\" \"wood,\" or \"hard.\"\n\n2. **Infinite regress**: Wittgenstein questions how one determines that the teacher's use of the word \"pencil\" is correct. The teacher's use of \"pencil\" must have been learned from someone else, who learned it from someone else, and so on. This creates an infinite regress problem, where one must always go back to another definition or example.\n\n3. **Following rules**: Wittgenstein also explores how one knows what rules to follow when using words. For example, in many languages, the word for a pencil changes depending on the context (e.g., \"le pencils\" in French when talking about multiple pencils). How does a language learner determine these rules?\n\n4. **Critique of psychological internalism**: Wittgenstein criticizes the idea that language is based on private mental associations (like the listener associating \"pencil\" with \"wood\"). Instead, Wittgenstein believes that language is a shared public practice, and its meaning arises from the use of words in a community.\n\nEssentially, Wittgenstein's critique of learning a language through ostensive definition implies that shared understanding, public use, and the community's context play essential roles in determining the meaning of words.", "shortest_response": "Ludwig Wittgenstein, in his philosophical works, raises the problem of private language and the limitations of ostensive defining in language acquisition. He argues that simple pointing and using a word to name an object, as in the example of teaching someone the word \"pencil,\" can lead to ambiguities and uncertainties in meaning.\n\nWittgenstein suggests that learners might misinterpret the word \"pencil\" based on their personal associations, perceptions, and pre-existing knowledge. In the example you provided, the listener might misunderstand \"pencil\" as \"wood,\" \"round,\" \"one,\" or \"hard,\" among other things. Wittgenstein calls these different possible interpretations \"meanings,\" but he questions how they can be shared and agreed upon by multiple people.\n\nHe argues that understanding a language requires not just knowing what a term refers to (i.e., the object being pointed at), but also mastering the rules and conventions that govern its usage in various contexts. These rules and conventions help to avoid ambiguity and establish a shared meaning among speakers. Therefore, learning a language can't be reduced to simple ostensive definitions but rather involves a complex process of socialization and cultural immersion.", "input_size": 255, "output_sizes": [274, 319, 376, 350, 384, 262, 268, 284, 292, 314], "output_mean": 312.3, "output_std": 42.24, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 276.5, "p50": 303.0, "p75": 342.25, "p99": 383.28}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "information_extraction", "gen_time": 9.19043}, {"sample_id": "474cc105621722b1", "prompt_id": "2678b784a17d61a6", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Write a letter to your friend expressing your feelings about earning your first wage.", "longest_response": "Dear [Friend's Name],\n\nI hope this letter finds you in the best of health and spirits.
