You can be assured that we at Contracts Specialist have worked on the same situations as yours regarding statutory warranty. If you need a legal advice on statutory warranties, you are in the right place.\n\nStatutory warranties under Section 18B\nAlthough the warranties are not present or written into the contract, the law states that these agreements still apply.\n\nThe Office of Fair Trading of New South Wales says that a building contract is considered as the most important transaction between parties in a construction project.\n\nConstruction contracts are required if the contract price is over $5,000 (including GST).\n\nThese are the descriptions of warranties by the contractor (and holder of a contractor licence) included in the Home Building Act \u2013 Statutory Warranties under Section 18B.\n\nA. Work will be done with due care and skill, and in accordance with the plans and specifications set out in the contract.\n\nWork must be performed with proper care and skill.\nWork must be performed according to plans and specifications indicated in the contract.\nThis is interpreted in a case-to-case basis.\nThis demands a period for work assessment.\n\u2018Workmanlike manner\u2019 may be limited based on the specified budget.\nB. All materials supplied by the holder or person will be good and suitable for the purpose for which they are used and that, unless otherwise stated in the contract, those materials will be new\n\nConstruction work materials must be suitable for its right purpose\nMaterials and supplies to be used for the construction project should be new- unless otherwise stated in the contract\nAlso, the builders must also think about any representations made by the owner as to the planned use of work such as the works of the owner that may affect your scope of work.\nC. Work will be done in accordance with, and will comply with, this or any other law\n\nWork is to be performed following the Home Building Act 1989 and other related laws in New South Wales.\n\nD.Work will be done with due diligence and within the time stipulated in the contract, or if no time is stipulated, within a reasonable time\n\nThe work must be done in accordance with the set time frame clearly stated in the contract.\nIf a timetable was not specified in the contract, the work must be done within an acceptable time, even if certain circumstances come up.\nE. If the work consists of the construction of a dwelling, the making of alterations or additions to a dwelling or the repairing, renovation, decoration or protective treatment of a dwelling, the work will result, to the extent of the work conducted, in a dwelling that is reasonably fit for occupation as a dwelling.\n\nIf the construction project is the building a residence, the end result must be an acceptable and good place to live in.\nIt must be reasonably fit for occupation as a dwelling.\nF. Work and any materials used in doing the work will be reasonably fit for the specified purpose or result, if the person for whom the work is done expressly makes known to the holder of the contractor licence or person required to hold a contractor licence, or another person with express or apparent authority to enter into or vary contractual arrangements on behalf of the holder or person, the particular purpose for which the work is required or the result that the owner desires the work to achieve, so as to show that the owner relies on the holder\u2019s or person\u2019s skill and judgment.\n\nThis warranty applies to work and materials. Mainly, this is the same to (b) warranty which states that materials used must be new and good, but this warranty has more distinct specifications.\n\nHow long are statutory warranties in effect?\n\n6 years for structural defects\n\n2 years for non-structural defects\n\nAmendments to the Act\n\nIn Home Building Amendment (Statutory Warranties) Act 2006\u200b, changes were made to the legislation such as including details regarding proceedings for breach of warranties.\n\nTo consult how these amendments apply to you and other concerns regarding statutory warranties, contact John Dela Cruz of Contracts Specialist.

Include the impact of these amendments on current practices.\n\n4. **Clarify Consultation Process:**\n   - Provide a step-by-step breakdown of the consultation process, emphasizing the expertise and experience of your team in handling statutory warranties.\n\n5. **Duration of Warranties:**\n   - Make sure the duration of warranties is clearly highlighted and explained, providing context for why these periods are significant.\n\nBy integrating these enhancements, your content will become more robust and detailed, potentially outranking the other two contents provided.", "shortest_response": "### Similarities Among Contents\n\n| Aspect | Content A | Content B | Your Content |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Definition of Statutory Warranties | Explained | Explained | Explained |\n| Purpose of Statutory Warranties | Incorporated into contracts | Incorporated into contracts | Incorporated into contracts |\n| Legal Requirements | Compliance with Home Building Act | Compliance with Home Building Act | Compliance with Home Building Act |\n| Scope of Application | Applies to residential buildings | Applies to residential buildings | Applies to residential buildings |\n| Warranty Details | Specific warranties listed | Specific warranties listed | Specific warranties listed |\n| Duration of Warranties | 6 years for structural defects, 2 years for non-structural defects | 6 years for structural defects, 2 years for non-structural defects | 6 years for structural defects, 2 years for non-structural defects |\n| Amendments to the Act | Mentioned | Mentioned | Mentioned |\n\n### Content Gaps and Opportunities for Enhancement\n\n#### 1. **Depth of Explanation**\n   - **Opportunity**: Both Content A and Content B provide detailed explanations of the specific warranties listed under Section 18B. While your content covers these points, consider expanding on each warranty with examples or scenarios to illustrate their practical implications.\n   \n#### 2. **Client Testimonials and Case Studies**\n   - **Opportunity**: Content A includes a brief mention of a client testimonial (\"Contracts Specialist has been helping many clients...\"). Including real-life case studies or testimonials could add credibility and make your content more relatable.\n   \n#### 3. **Legal Advice and Consultation Services**\n   - **Opportunity**: Content B emphasizes consulting services for understanding amendments and legal standing. Your content already mentions consulting services but could benefit from highlighting specific steps or processes for consultation, emphasizing the value added by Contracts Specialist.\n   \n#### 4. **Visual Aids and Infographics**\n   - **Opportunity**: Both Content A and Content B use bullet points and structured text, which are easy to read. Consider incorporating infographics or tables to visually represent key information like warranty durations or requirements, which can make the content more engaging.\n   \n#### 5. **Interactive Elements**\n   - **Opportunity**: Content A includes a call-to-action with a direct link to a service page. Adding interactive elements such as a FAQ section, a chatbot, or a quick quiz to test readers' knowledge could engage visitors more effectively and encourage them to explore further.\n   \n#### 6. **SEO Optimization**\n   - **Opportunity**: Both Content A and Content B seem to be optimized for search engines, using keywords effectively. Ensure your content is optimized for SEO by including relevant keywords throughout the text, especially in headings and subheadings, to improve visibility in search results.\n   \n#### 7. **Comparison with Other Jurisdictions**\n   - **Opportunity**: Content A and Content B do not compare statutory warranties with other jurisdictions, but this could be valuable information. Including a brief comparison could position your content as a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in statutory warranties across different regions.\n   \nBy addressing these gaps and leveraging the strengths identified in Content A and Content B, you can create a more robust and authoritative service page that not only meets but exceeds the expectations of your target audience.", "input_size": 1299, "output_sizes": [916, 670, 712, 742, 786, 691, 904, 786, 725, 854], "output_mean": 778.6, "output_std": 82.77, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 715.25, "p50": 764.0, "p75": 837.0, "p99": 914.92}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 65.01084}, {"sample_id": "1cadf9520ef65113", "prompt_id": "66843cbc6b744fe5", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "I'm helping to create customer service training for call center reps however we don't have any shadowing plans available as there are no calls for the agents to actively shadow.

Here are some strategies you might consider:\n\n1. **Role-Playing Exercises**: Simulate common customer scenarios and have trainees practice responding to these situations. This can be done one-on-one or in small groups.\n\n2. **Scripted Call Replication**: Use recordings of past calls (with consent and anonymized) to replicate calls. Trainees can listen to the calls and then role-play their responses, followed by a debriefing session where they discuss what worked well and what could be improved.\n\n3. **Video Demonstrations**: Create video tutorials that demonstrate best practices for handling different types of customer inquiries. These videos can include tips on tone, language, and problem-solving techniques.\n\n4. **Scenario-Based Learning**: Develop detailed case studies based on actual customer interactions. Trainees can work through these cases individually or in teams, analyzing the situation and proposing solutions.\n\n5. **Online Simulations**: Utilize online platforms designed for call center training. These tools often simulate real-world scenarios and allow trainees to practice in a safe, controlled environment.\n\n6. **Interactive Webinars**: Host live sessions where experienced agents can lead discussions and answer questions about how to handle specific customer issues. This can also include interactive elements like polls or quizzes.\n\n7. **Customer Feedback Analysis**: If your organization has a feedback system in place, use this data to identify common issues and areas for improvement. Discuss these findings with trainees and develop strategies for addressing them.\n\n8. **Mentorship Programs**: Pair new trainees with more experienced agents who can provide guidance and support. While direct shadowing isn\u2019t possible, mentors can share their insights and experiences during regular meetings or check-ins.\n\n9. **Self-Paced Learning Modules**: Create a series of modules that cover various aspects of customer service, such as communication skills, product knowledge, and conflict resolution. These can be accessed online at the trainee\u2019s convenience.\n\n10. **Feedback Loops**: Implement a system where trainees can practice their skills and receive immediate feedback from trainers or peers.

Discuss common themes and how they can be addressed more effectively in future interactions.\n\n7. **Scenario-Based Learning Games**: Create games or challenges based on different customer service scenarios. This can make learning more engaging and memorable.\n\n8. **Mock Customer Interactions**: Set up a mock call center environment where trainees can take turns being both the agent and the customer. This helps them understand the perspective of the customer and how to handle various types of inquiries and complaints.\n\n9. **Online Forums and Discussion Boards**: Encourage ongoing discussion and sharing of experiences among trainees and current employees. Platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams can facilitate this.\n\n10. **Reading Materials and Articles**: Provide articles, books, and other reading materials that focus on customer service best practices, emotional intelligence, and effective communication.\n\nBy combining these methods, you can create a comprehensive training program that prepares your call center representatives to handle a variety of customer interactions effectively, even without direct shadowing opportunities.", "input_size": 73, "output_sizes": [435, 480, 439, 488, 436, 477, 453, 464, 434, 489], "output_mean": 459.5, "output_std": 21.67, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 436.75, "p50": 458.5, "p75": 479.25, "p99": 488.91}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 19.03282}, {"sample_id": "02e4f145c6ee8df5", "prompt_id": "879c63c28e44c2c3", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Turn this string into actual sourcecode:\n'/\\*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react\\*/\\n' +\n 'const {Fragment: \\_Fragment, jsxDEV: \\_jsxDEV} = arguments[0];\\n' +\n 'const {useMDXComponents: \\_provideComponents} = arguments[0];\\n' +\n 'function \\_createMdxContent(props) {\\n' +\n ' const \\_components = Object.assign({\\n' +\n ' h1: \"h1\",\\n' +\n ' p: \"p\"\\n' +\n ' }, \\_provideComponents(), props.components);\\n' +\n ' return \\_jsxDEV(\\_Fragment, {\\n' +\n ' children: [\\_jsxDEV(\\_components.h1, {\\n' +\n ' children: \"hello!\"\\n' +\n ' }, undefined, false, {\\n' +\n ' fileName: \"\",\\n' +\n ' lineNumber: 1,\\n' +\n ' columnNumber: 1\\n' +\n ' }, this), \"\\\\n\", \\_jsxDEV(\\_components.p, {\\n' +\n ' children: \"This is from Server Components!\"\\n' +\n ' }, undefined, false, {\\n' +\n ' fileName: \"\",\\n' +\n ' lineNumber: 2,\\n' +\n ' columnNumber: 7\\n' +\n ' }, this)]\\n' +\n ' }, undefined, true, {\\n' +\n ' fileName: \"\",\\n' +\n ' lineNumber: 1,\\n' +\n ' columnNumber: 1\\n' +\n ' }, this);\\n' +\n '}\\n' +\n 'function MDXContent(props = {}) {\\n' +\n ' const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = Object.assign({}, \\_provideComponents(), props.components);\\n' +\n ' return MDXLayout ? \\_jsxDEV(MDXLayout, Object.assign({}, props, {\\n' +\n ' children: \\_jsxDEV(\\_createMdxContent, props, undefined, false, {\\n' +\n ' fileName: \"\"\\n' +\n ' }, this)\\n' +\n ' }), undefined, false, {\\n' +\n ' fileName: \"\"\\n' +\n ' }, this) : \\_createMdxContent(props);\\n' +\n '}\\n' +\n 'return {\\n' +\n ' default: MDXContent\\n' +\n '};\\n'", "longest_response": "The provided string seems to be a JSX/React code snippet that has been concatenated into a single string.

Platform channels allow for communication between the Dart code in your Flutter app and the native code (Objective-C/Swift on iOS or Java/Kotlin on Android). This way, you can leverage the power of native code to access device-specific features that aren't available via Flutter's built-in APIs.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief overview of how you can achieve this:\n\n### Steps to Use Native Modules\n\n1. **Create the Native Module**:\n   - For iOS: Write Objective-C or Swift code.\n   - For Android: Write Java or Kotlin code.\n\n2. **Define a Method Channel**:\n   - In your Flutter code, define a `MethodChannel` which will be used to communicate with the native side.\n   ```dart\n   import 'package:flutter/services.dart';\n\n   const platform = MethodChannel('samples.flutter.io/battery');\n\n   Future<String> getBatteryLevel() async {\n     String batteryLevel;\n     try {\n       final int result = await platform.invokeMethod('getBatteryLevel');\n       batteryLevel = 'Battery level at $result % .';\n     } on PlatformException catch (e) {\n       batteryLevel = \"Failed to get battery level: '${e.message}'.\";\n     }\n     return batteryLevel;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Implement the Native Code**:\n   - On the iOS side, implement the method handler in Swift or Objective-C.\n   - On the Android side, implement the method handler in Java or Kotlin.\n\n4. **Register the Method Channel in Native Code**:\n   - Ensure that the method channel is registered properly so that it can respond to calls from the Flutter side.\n\n### Example: Getting Battery Level\n\n- **Flutter Side**:\n  ```dart\n  import 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n  import 'package:flutter/services.dart';\n\n  void main() => runApp(MyApp());\n\n  class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {\n    @override\n    _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();\n  }\n\n  class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {\n\n    String _batteryLevel = 'Unknown battery level.';\n\n    @override\n    void initState() {\n      super.initState();\n      initPlatformState();\n    }\n\n    // Platform messages are asynchronous, so we initialize in an async method.\n    Future<void> initPlatformState() async {\n      String batteryLevel;\n      try {\n        batteryLevel = await getBatteryLevel();\n      } on PlatformException {\n        batteryLevel = 'Failed to get battery level.';\n      }\n\n      if (!mounted) return;\n\n      setState(() {\n        _batteryLevel = batteryLevel;\n      });\n    }\n\n    @override\n    Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n      return MaterialApp(\n        home: Scaffold(\n          appBar: AppBar(\n            title: const Text('Plugin example app'),\n          ),\n          body: Center(\n            child: Text('Battery level: $_batteryLevel\\n'),\n          ),\n        ),\n      );\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Android Side** (Java):\n  ```java\n  package com.example.myapp;\n\n  import io.flutter.plugin.common.MethodCall;\n  import io.flutter.plugin.common.MethodChannel;\n  import io.flutter.plugin.common.MethodChannel.MethodCallHandler;\n  import io.flutter.plugin.common.MethodChannel.Result;\n  import io.flutter.plugin.common.PluginRegistry.Registrar;\n\n  public class BatteryPlugin implements MethodCallHandler {\n    private static final String CHANNEL = \"samples.flutter.io/battery\";\n\n    public static void registerWith(Registrar registrar) {\n      final MethodChannel channel = new MethodChannel(registrar.messenger(), CHANNEL);\n      channel.setMethodCallHandler(new BatteryPlugin());\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onMethodCall(MethodCall call, Result result) {\n      if (call.method.equals(\"getBatteryLevel\")) {\n        int batteryLevel = getBatteryLevel();\n        if (batteryLevel != -1) {\n          result.success(batteryLevel);\n        } else {\n          result.error(\"UNAVAILABLE\", \"Battery level not available.\", null);\n        }\n      } else {\n        result.notImplemented();\n      }\n    }\n\n    private int getBatteryLevel() {\n      // Implementation here\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **iOS Side** (Swift):\n  ```swift\n  import Flutter\n  import UIKit\n\n  public class SwiftBatteryPlugin: NSObject, FlutterPlugin {\n    public static func register(with registrar: FlutterPluginRegistrar) {\n      let channel = FlutterMethodChannel(name: \"samples.flutter.io/battery\", binaryMessenger: registrar.messenger())\n      let instance = SwiftBatteryPlugin()\n      registrar.addMethodCallDelegate(instance, channel: channel)\n    }\n\n    public func handle(_ call: FlutterMethodCall, result: @escaping FlutterResult) {\n      if call.method == \"getBatteryLevel\" {\n        getBatteryLevel(result: result)\n      } else {\n        result(FlutterMethodNotImplemented)\n      }\n    }\n\n    private func getBatteryLevel(result: @escaping FlutterResult) {\n      UIDevice.current.batteryMonitoringEnabled = true\n      result(Int(UIDevice.current.batteryLevel * 100))\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively integrate native modules into your Flutter application, allowing you to extend functionality beyond what is provided by Flutter itself.", "shortest_response": "Yes, you can use native iOS and Android modules inside a Flutter app through several mechanisms provided by the Flutter framework to integrate native code. Here are some common methods:\n\n1. **Platform Channels**: This is one of the primary ways to interact with native code from Dart. Platform channels allow you to call platform-specific APIs that aren't available in Flutter's API set. You can create custom method channels for communication between your Flutter code and native code.\n\n2. **Method Channels**: These are used for making one-time requests or calls to native code. For example, accessing the camera or GPS might require a method channel to communicate with the native implementation.\n\n3. **Event Channels**: If you need to listen to continuous streams of data from the native side, event channels are used. An example would be listening to Bluetooth events or location updates.\n\n4. **Plugin Architecture**: Flutter has a robust plugin ecosystem where developers can build plugins that wrap native functionality and make it accessible via Dart APIs. Plugins often combine both method and event channels under the hood.\n\n5. **Embedding Native Widgets**: You can embed native UI components within your Flutter application using `PlatformView` on iOS and `AndroidView`/`SurfaceAndroidView` on Android. However, this approach is more complex and less commonly used than the above methods.\n\n6. **Using Packages**: Many developers contribute their work as packages to the Flutter package repository (pub.dev). You can find numerous packages that encapsulate native functionality, allowing you to use them directly in your Flutter project without writing any native code yourself.\n\nTo summarize, integrating native modules into a Flutter app is quite feasible and supported through these mechanisms, providing flexibility and access to features not yet covered by Flutter's core libraries.", "input_size": 42, "output_sizes": [353, 774, 861, 909, 928, 808, 794, 1081, 365, 348], "output_mean": 722.1, "output_std": 253.85, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 467.25, "p50": 801.0, "p75": 897.0, "p99": 1067.23}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 48.29445}, {"sample_id": "525e40c3a25383d9", "prompt_id": "370cb1272516cd82", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "I am curious about 4.

Understanding that this is part of the decision-making process can help you approach the situation more calmly.\n\n2. **List Pros and Cons**: Create a detailed list of pros and cons for each option. This can help you see objectively what each choice offers and may reveal factors you hadn't considered before.\n\n3. **Seek External Perspectives**: Sometimes, an outside perspective can provide clarity. Talk to trusted friends, family members, or mentors who can offer insights and advice based on their experiences.\n\n4. **Consider Long-Term Goals**: Reflect on how each remaining option aligns with your long-term goals and values. This can help prioritize which option is most beneficial in the long run.\n\n5. **Try Visualization**: Imagine yourself in the future after choosing each option. How do you feel? What are the outcomes? This mental exercise can sometimes provide clues about which path feels more right.\n\n6. **Take Breaks**: If you find yourself getting stuck or overwhelmed, taking a break can be beneficial. Stepping away from the decision for a while can give you a fresh perspective when you return.\n\n7. **Embrace Uncertainty**: Accepting that some level of uncertainty is inevitable can reduce anxiety. Trusting that you will adapt and grow regardless of the outcome can also ease the pressure of making the \"perfect\" decision.\n\n8. **Decision-Making Techniques**: Consider using techniques like the Eisenhower Matrix or Pareto Principle to prioritize tasks and decisions effectively.\n\n9. **Mindfulness and Relaxation**: Practices such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga can help calm your mind and reduce stress associated with decision-making.\n\n10. **Make a Decision and Move Forward**: At some point, you'll need to commit to one option. Remember, even the best decisions often involve some degree of risk.

It keeps us flexible and open to new opportunities that we might not have considered before.\n\n2. **Set Clear Criteria:** Before making a decision, define what's most important to you in the situation. Setting clear criteria can help reduce the number of factors you need to consider and make it easier to evaluate your options.\n\n3. **Experimentation:** If possible, try out different paths in small ways. For example, if you're choosing between two career paths, see if you can take on a short-term project or internship in each area to gain more insight.\n\n4. **Seek Feedback:** Talk to trusted friends, mentors, or colleagues about your dilemma. They might provide a fresh perspective or help you clarify your priorities.\n\n5. **Make a Decision and Commit:** At some point, you will need to commit to a choice. Once you've done your best to gather information and consider your options, make a decision and move forward with confidence.\n\n6. **Reflect on Past Decisions:** Think back on times when you made decisions that worked out well and those that didn't.

Here's a step-by-step guide to building such a model:\n\n1. **Import necessary libraries**:\n   ```python\n   import torch\n   import torch.nn as nn\n   import torch.optim as optim\n   from torchvision import datasets, transforms\n   ```\n\n2. **Data preprocessing**:\n   - Normalize the data to have zero mean and unit standard deviation.\n   - Use `DataLoader` for batching and shuffling the dataset.\n   ```python\n   transform = transforms.Compose([\n       transforms.ToTensor(),\n       transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))\n   ])\n\n   train_dataset = datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)\n   test_dataset = datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform)\n\n   train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)\n   test_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=1000, shuffle=False)\n   ```\n\n3. **Define the CNN model**:\n   A simple yet effective CNN architecture includes convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers.\n   ```python\n   class Net(nn.Module):\n       def __init__(self):\n           super(Net, self).__init__()\n           self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)\n           self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)\n           self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0)\n           self.fc1 = nn.Linear(64 * 7 * 7, 512)  # 28/2/2 = 7\n           self.fc2 = nn.Linear(512, 10)\n\n       def forward(self, x):\n           x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))\n           x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))\n           x = x.view(-1, 64 * 7 * 7)\n           x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))\n           x = self.fc2(x)\n           return x\n\n   model = Net()\n   ```\n\n4. **Loss function and optimizer**:\n   - Use CrossEntropyLoss for multi-class classification.\n   - Adam optimizer is efficient for most cases.\n   ```python\n   criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\n   optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)\n   ```\n\n5. **Training loop**:\n   - Train the model on the training set.\n   - Evaluate its performance on the test set after each epoch.\n   ```python\n   num_epochs = 10\n   for epoch in range(num_epochs):\n       running_loss = 0.0\n       for i, (images, labels) in enumerate(train_loader):\n           optimizer.zero_grad()\n           outputs = model(images)\n           loss = criterion(outputs, labels)\n           loss.backward()\n           optimizer.step()\n\n           running_loss += loss.item()\n           if i % 100 == 99:  # print every 100 mini-batches\n               print(f'[Epoch {epoch + 1}, Batch {i + 1}] Loss: {running_loss / 100:.3f}')\n               running_loss = 0.0\n\n       # Test the model\n       correct = 0\n       total = 0\n       with torch.no_grad():\n           for images, labels in test_loader:\n               outputs = model(images)\n               _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)\n               total += labels.size(0)\n               correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()\n\n       print(f'Accuracy of the network on the 10000 test images: {100 * correct / total:.2f}%')\n   ```\n\nThis setup provides a solid foundation for classifying the MNIST dataset using a CNN in PyTorch.

not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door\u2014\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door\u2014\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n\"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore\u2014\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"\nQuoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\"\n\nMuch I marveled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning\u2014little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door\u2014\nBird or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as \"Nevermore.\"\n\nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered\u2014not a feather then he fluttered\u2014\nTill I scarcely more than muttered \"Other friends have flown before\u2014\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.\"\nQuoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\"\n\nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore\u2014\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf 'Never\u2014nevermore'.\"\n\nBut the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore\u2014\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\n\nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,\nBut whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n\nThen methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n\"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee\u2014by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite\u2014respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!\"\nQuoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\"\n\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!\u2014prophet still, if bird or devil!\u2014\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted\u2014\nOn this home by Horror haunted\u2014tell me truly, I implore\u2014\nIs there\u2014is there balm in Gilead?\u2014tell me\u2014tell me, I implore!\"\nQuoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\"\n\n\"Prophesy!\" said I then, \"thing of evil\u2014prophesy to me doth seem\nThat I shall see thee again to-morrow in the same distressing dream.\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!\u2014quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\nQuoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\"\n\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted\u2014nevermore!\n\n---\n\nIn the eerie silence of this tale, let us weave the concept of fractional reserve banking into the shadows of Poe's \"The Raven.\" Imagine the bank as a dark and ancient vault, where whispers of gold and silver dance through the cobwebbed corridors of financial history. Within this vault, the concept of fractional reserve banking looms like the raven, haunting the dreams of those who seek solace in its depths.\n\nFractional reserve banking is akin to the raven's presence\u2014it appears as a silent specter, yet its influence is profound. Just as the raven speaks only of \"nevermore,\" fractional reserve banking whispers of growth and expansion, yet its true nature is one of risk and uncertainty. In this system, banks are required to hold only a fraction of their deposits as reserves, while lending out the rest. This practice, much like the raven's solitary perch, seems both comforting and unsettling.\n\nJust as the raven's shadow stretches across the floor, casting long, eerie lines that seem to mock the narrator's despair, fractional reserve banking casts a long shadow over the financial world. It promises prosperity, but also carries the weight of potential crises, should depositors demand more funds than the bank holds in reserve.\n\nThus, in the somber chambers of financial lore, the raven of fractional reserve banking sits, a silent sentinel of economic practices past and present, reminding us that in the realm of finance, as in the realm of dreams, the echoes of \"nevermore\" linger on.", "shortest_response": "Once upon a midnight dreary, as I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore\u2014\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n\"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door\u2014\n            Only this and nothing more.\"\n  \nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;\u2014vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow\u2014sorrow for the lost Lenore\u2014\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore\u2014\n            Nameless here for evermore.\n\nAnd the lamplight o'er thee streaming throws its\u9ed8\u9ed8\u7b49\u5f85\u63d0\u95ee\u8005\u8981\u6c42\u7ee7\u7eed\u521b\u4f5c\u6216\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6307\u793a\u3002\u6839\u636e\u60a8\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6211\u5c06\u8fd9\u6bb5\u300a\u4e4c\u9e26\u300b\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u201c\u90e8\u5206\u51c6\u5907\u91d1\u94f6\u884c\u5236\u5ea6\u201d\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u8bf7\u95ee\u662f\u5426\u9700\u8981\u7ee7\u7eed\u6b64\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6587\u5b66\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff1f", "input_size": 49, "output_sizes": [685, 1774, 719, 1309, 1651, 223, 1024, 945, 652, 1009], "output_mean": 999.1, "output_std": 450.01, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 693.5, "p50": 977.0, "p75": 1237.75, "p99": 1762.93}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 92.76261}, {"sample_id": "e2c268f2f1eb1d53", "prompt_id": "e31e21ee4e028a03", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Including the initial parent process, how many processes are created by\nthe program \n#include \n#include \n#include \nint main()\n{\npid t pid;\n/\\* fork a child process \\*/\npid = fork();\nif (pid < 0) { /\\* error occurred \\*/\nfprintf(stderr, \"Fork Failed\");\nreturn 1;\n}\nelse if (pid == 0) { /\\* child process \\*/\nexeclp(\"/bin/ls\",\"ls\",NULL);\nprintf(\"LINE J\");\n}\nelse { /\\* parent process \\*/\n/\\* parent will wait for the child to complete \\*/\nwait(NULL);\nprintf(\"Child Complete\");\n}\nreturn 0;\n}", "longest_response": "In the provided C program, there is an attempt to create a new process using the `fork()` system call. The `fork()` function creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. Here's a step-by-step analysis of what happens in the program:\n\n1. **Initial Process**: The program starts with one process, which is the parent process.\n\n2. **Fork Call**: When the `fork()` function is called in the parent process, it duplicates the current process and returns twice:\n   - In the parent process, `fork()` returns the PID (process ID) of the newly created child process.\n   - In the child process, `fork()` returns 0.\n\n3. **Child Process**:\n   - If `pid` is 0, the code inside the `else if (pid == 0)` block executes. This means that the child process will execute the `execlp()` function to replace its current image with `/bin/ls` (which lists directory contents). After `execlp()`, any code following it in the child process will not be executed because `execlp()` does not return unless an error occurs. However, there is a `printf(\"LINE J\");` statement after `execlp()`, which theoretically won't be reached because `execlp()` replaces the current process image with the `/bin/ls` command.\n   \n4. **Parent Process**:\n   - If `pid > 0`, the code inside the `else` block executes. This means the parent process waits for the child process to terminate using `wait(NULL)`. Once the child completes, it prints \"Child Complete\".\n\nGiven this setup, we can summarize the number of processes as follows:\n\n- Initially, there is 1 process (the parent).\n- After the `fork()`, there are 2 processes: the original parent and the newly created child.\n- The child process replaces itself with `/bin/ls`, but this doesn't count as creating another process since `execlp()` replaces the current process image rather than spawning a new process.\n\nTherefore, including the initial parent process, **2 processes are created by the program**: the initial parent process and the child process created by the `fork()` call.", "shortest_response": "The program you've described creates two processes in total: the original parent process and one child process.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what happens:\n\n1. The `fork()` system call is invoked in the parent process. This call creates a new child process that is an exact copy of the parent process, except for the return value from `fork()`. In the parent process, `fork()` returns a positive integer (the PID of the child), whereas in the child process, it returns 0.\n\n2. If `fork()` fails (i.e., it returns -1), an error message is printed and the program exits with status 1.\n\n3. If `fork()` succeeds, the program branches into two paths:\n   - In the child process (`if (pid == 0)`), `execlp` is called to replace the current process image with a new process image associated with the file `/bin/ls`. After this call, the child process will execute the `ls` command.\n     - Note that after calling `execlp`, the subsequent `printf(\"LINE J\");` will never be executed because `execlp` does not return unless it fails.\n   - In the parent process (`else` block), it waits for the child process to finish using `wait(NULL)` before printing `\"Child Complete\"`.\n\nTherefore, including the initial parent process, there are **two** processes created by the program: the original parent process and the child process created by `fork()`.", "input_size": 165, "output_sizes": [304, 448, 329, 455, 460, 356, 396, 371, 335, 403], "output_mean": 385.7, "output_std": 53.07, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 340.25, "p50": 383.5, "p75": 436.75, "p99": 459.55}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 18.78394}, {"sample_id": "c010088fe861db25", "prompt_id": "d3ea5ffe1a9436da", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "I'm creating a course for experienced watercolour painters to help them start earning money by creating different products that they can sell on digital product platforms ... create an customer avatar for this kind of person", "longest_response": "Creating a customer avatar is a great way to understand your target audience better and tailor your course content effectively.

Below is a step-by-step guide on how to set this up.\n\n### Step 1: Install Playwright\n\nFirst, ensure that Playwright is installed in your project. You can install it via npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @playwright/test\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create Your Tests\n\nCreate your Playwright tests in your project. For example, you might have a file named `test.spec.js`:\n\n```javascript\nconst { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');\n\ntest('basic test', async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n  const title = await page.title();\n  expect(title).toBe('Example Domain');\n});\n```\n\n### Step 3: Configure `project.json`\n\nIn order to use Playwright with an executor defined in a `project.json`, you will need to define a task that runs your tests. Here\u2019s an example configuration for `project.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"./node_modules/azure-pipelines/tasks/workflow/workflow.json\",\n  \"version\": 1,\n  \"phases\": [\n    {\n      \"steps\": [\n        {\n          \"task\": \"NodeTool@0\",\n          \"inputs\": {\n            \"version\": \"14.x\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"task\": \"Npm@1\",\n          \"inputs\": {\n            \"command\": \"custom\",\n            \"customCommand\": \"run test\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"triggers\": []\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we're using Azure Pipelines syntax, but the concept should be similar across different CI/CD tools.\n\n- **NodeTool@0**: This task installs Node.js.\n- **Npm@1**: This task runs an npm command. In this case, we're running `npm run test`.\n\n### Step 4: Define Script in `package.json`\n\nMake sure you have a script in your `package.json` to run your Playwright tests:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"npx playwright test\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis tells npm to run your Playwright tests when you execute `npm run test`.\n\n### Step 5: Run Your Project\n\nNow, when you trigger your pipeline or build process configured with the `project.json`, it will run the specified tasks which include installing dependencies and running your Playwright tests.\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- Ensure that the environment where your tests are running has access to the necessary browsers (or headless browser engines) that Playwright uses.\n- Customize the `project.json` according to the specific CI/CD platform you are using (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc.).\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to integrate Playwright tests into your CI/CD pipeline and run them as part of your project's build process.", "shortest_response": "To run Playwright's test runner in the context of an Executor defined in a `project.json` file, you typically need to integrate Playwright with your build or task runner system. The `project.json` file is often used in frameworks like Nx or similar monorepos for defining projects and their configurations.\n\nHere's how you can set up Playwright tests to be run as part of an executor:\n\n1. **Install Playwright**: Ensure that Playwright is installed in your project.\n   ```bash\n   npm install @playwright/test\n   ```\n\n2. **Create Your Tests**: Write your Playwright tests in the appropriate directory. For example, you might have a `tests/e2e` directory where all your end-to-end tests reside.\n\n3. **Define Executor in `project.json`**: In the `project.json` file for your project, define an executor that runs Playwright tests. Here\u2019s an example configuration:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"my-project\",\n     \"executor\": {\n       \"command\": \"npx playwright test\"\n     },\n     \"targets\": {\n       \"test\": {\n         \"executor\": \":executor\",\n         \"options\": {\n           \"command\": \"npx playwright test\",\n           \"parallel\": true,\n           \"ci\": true\n         }\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the Tests**: You can now run your Playwright tests using the executor command defined in `project.json`. For example, if you're using Nx, you could run:\n   ```bash\n   npx nx run my-project:test\n   ```\n\nThis setup assumes that Playwright is correctly configured and that the `playwright.config.ts` (or `.js`) file is present in your project root or within the `tests/e2e` directory, specifying any necessary configurations such as browsers to use, timeouts, etc.\n\nRemember, the exact commands and structure may vary depending on the specifics of your project setup and the version of Playwright and other dependencies you're using. Always refer to the official Playwright documentation and your project's specific documentation for the most accurate guidance.", "input_size": 44, "output_sizes": [553, 639, 517, 593, 577, 585, 559, 532, 436, 598], "output_mean": 558.9, "output_std": 52.66, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 537.25, "p50": 568.0, "p75": 591.0, "p99": 635.31}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 25.49866}, {"sample_id": "8146d764e8540662", "prompt_id": "0dccd1f3217126d6", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Explain the moon landing to a 6 year old in a few sentences.", "longest_response": "Sure!

This method will give you a list of tables that have foreign keys pointing to your target table.\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    KCU1.CONSTRAINT_NAME AS FK_CONSTRAINT_NAME,\n    KCU1.TABLE_NAME AS FK_TABLE_NAME,\n    KCU1.COLUMN_NAME AS FK_COLUMN_NAME,\n    KCU2.CONSTRAINT_NAME AS PK_CONSTRAINT_NAME,\n    KCU2.TABLE_NAME AS PK_TABLE_NAME,\n    KCU2.COLUMN_NAME AS PK_COLUMN_NAME\nFROM \n    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE KCU1\nJOIN \n    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE KCU2 \nON \n    KCU1.REFERENCED_TABLE_SCHEMA = KCU2.TABLE_SCHEMA \n    AND KCU1.REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME = KCU2.TABLE_NAME \n    AND KCU1.REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME = KCU2.COLUMN_NAME\nWHERE \n    KCU1.REFERENCED_TABLE_SCHEMA = 'your_database_name' -- Replace with your database name\n    AND KCU1.REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME = 'your_table_name'; -- Replace with your table name\n```\n\nThis SQL query will show you all the foreign key relationships where `your_table_name` is referenced by other tables.\n\n### Method 2: Using `SHOW CREATE TABLE`\n\nAnother way to check for foreign keys is to look at the creation statements of other tables. This method involves running `SHOW CREATE TABLE` on each table in your database and checking if there are any foreign key constraints referencing your table.\n\n```sql\n-- Example of how to check one table\nSHOW CREATE TABLE some_table;\n```\n\nHowever, manually checking each table is impractical for large databases. You can automate this process with a script that loops through all tables and checks their creation statements.\n\n### Automating the Process\n\nIf you have a lot of tables, you might want to create a script that automates the process of finding foreign key references. Here\u2019s an example using a stored procedure or a simple script outside of HeidiSQL (you could run this script within MySQL):\n\n```sql\nDELIMITER $$\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE FindForeignKeysForTable(IN tableName VARCHAR(255))\nBEGIN\n    SELECT \n        KCU1.CONSTRAINT_NAME AS FK_CONSTRAINT_NAME,\n        KCU1.TABLE_NAME AS FK_TABLE_NAME,\n        KCU1.COLUMN_NAME AS FK_COLUMN_NAME,\n        KCU2.CONSTRAINT_NAME AS PK_CONSTRAINT_NAME,\n        KCU2.TABLE_NAME AS PK_TABLE_NAME,\n        KCU2.COLUMN_NAME AS PK_COLUMN_NAME\n    FROM \n        INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE KCU1\n    JOIN \n        INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE KCU2 \n    ON \n        KCU1.REFERENCED_TABLE_SCHEMA = KCU2.TABLE_SCHEMA \n        AND KCU1.REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME = KCU2.TABLE_NAME \n        AND KCU1.REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME = KCU2.COLUMN_NAME\n    WHERE \n        KCU1.REFERENCED_TABLE_SCHEMA = DATABASE() -- Current database\n        AND KCU1.REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME = tableName;\nEND$$\n\nDELIMITER ;\n\nCALL FindForeignKeysForTable('your_table_name');\n```\n\nReplace `'your_table_name'` with the name of the table you're interested in. This stored procedure will return all foreign key relationships involving your specified table.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify all tables that are related to the one you wish to delete, allowing you to make informed decisions about the deletion process.", "shortest_response": "To find out which tables are related to a specific table in MySQL using HeidiSQL or any other SQL client, you can query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database, which contains metadata about all your databases and tables.\n\nSpecifically, you can look at the `KEY_COLUMN_USAGE` table within the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`. This table contains information about foreign key relationships between tables. Here is an example query that will show you all the tables that have a foreign key referencing your specified table:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    kcu1.CONSTRAINT_NAME AS FK_CONSTRAINT_NAME,\n    kcu1.TABLE_NAME AS REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME,\n    kcu1.COLUMN_NAME AS REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME,\n    kcu2.TABLE_NAME AS PARENT_TABLE_NAME,\n    kcu2.COLUMN_NAME AS PARENT_COLUMN_NAME\nFROM \n    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE kcu1\nJOIN \n    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE kcu2\nON \n    kcu1.CONSTRAINT_NAME = kcu2.CONSTRAINT_NAME\nWHERE \n    kcu1.REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME = 'your_table_name'\nAND \n    kcu1.REFERENCED_TABLE_SCHEMA = DATABASE();\n```\n\nReplace `'your_table_name'` with the name of the table you want to check for relationships.\n\nThis query does the following:\n- It joins the `KEY_COLUMN_USAGE` table on itself based on the constraint name.\n- It filters the results to only include constraints where the referenced table is the one you're interested in.\n- It shows you the names of the tables that reference your table (these are the \"parent\" tables in this context).\n\nIf you want to delete a table that has foreign keys referencing it, you first need to either remove those foreign keys from the parent tables or handle the data accordingly (e.g., cascade delete or manually delete dependent records).

Well, let's see if we can't make you look a little less plain jane and a bit more like you actually give a damn about your appearance, shall we?\n\nFirst things first, you need to understand that makeup is not just slapping on whatever color you like. It\u2019s an art, darling, and one that requires precision and a bit of know-how. So listen up, because I'm only going to say this once.\n\n1. **Start with a clean slate**: Before you even think about putting anything on your face, make sure it's squeaky clean. No one wants to wear their dirt and oil from the day before. Wash your face with a gentle cleanser and pat dry. If you're feeling extra fancy, go ahead and use a toner and moisturizer too. But don\u2019t overdo it; we don\u2019t want you looking like you\u2019re about to do a skincare commercial.\n\n2. **Primer is your new best friend**: Primer goes on before everything else. It helps your makeup last longer and makes your skin look smoother. Think of it as the base layer in a painting. Don\u2019t skimp here, okay? We don\u2019t want any of your hard work to go to waste.\n\n3. **Foundation**: Now, you\u2019re probably thinking you can just grab any old foundation and slap it on. Wrong! Find one that matches your skin tone exactly. Too light, and you\u2019ll look like a ghost. Too dark, and you'll look like you\u2019ve been playing dress-up. Apply it with a brush or a sponge, blending it into your neck and hairline so there\u2019s no harsh line. And remember, less is more. You\u2019re trying to enhance your natural beauty, not cover it up completely.\n\n4. **Concealer**: This is where you hide those pesky blemishes and dark circles. Use a shade that\u2019s a little lighter than your foundation. Dot it on the areas you want to cover, then blend, blend, blend. Don\u2019t leave any patches or streaks. We\u2019re aiming for perfection here, not a Jackson Pollock painting.\n\n5. **Powder**: Set everything with a translucent powder. It will help control shine and keep your makeup in place. Be gentle with the application though; you don\u2019t want to look like a porcelain doll.\n\n6. **Eyeshadow**: Pick a neutral palette to start. Browns and grays are safe bets. Apply a light color all over your lid, then add a darker shade in the crease for depth. Blend, blend, blend. And please, no sparkles unless you want to look like a disco ball.\n\n7. **Eyeliner**: Start at the inner corner of your eye and draw a thin line along your lash line. Extend it slightly at the outer corner if you want a winged look. Practice makes perfect, so don\u2019t get frustrated if it doesn\u2019t come out right the first few times.\n\n8. **Mascara**: This is your secret weapon for making your eyes pop. Curl your lashes first, then apply mascara from root to tip. Two coats should do the trick. And for heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t forget to clean the wand after each coat to avoid clumps.\n\n9. **Lips**: Choose a lipstick that complements your skin tone and eye makeup. A nude lip can be very flattering, especially if you\u2019re wearing bold eyeshadow. Apply it evenly and carefully. And don\u2019t forget to touch up throughout the day, or you\u2019ll end up with a smudged mess.\n\n10. **Setting Spray**: Finish off with a setting spray to lock everything in place. You don\u2019t want to be constantly touching up your makeup every five minutes.\n\nAnd there you have it, sugarplum. Follow these steps, and you might just pass for someone who knows what they\u2019re doing. But remember, it\u2019s not just about looking good; it\u2019s about feeling confident.

First things first, you better have your face clean and clear or else you're gonna look like a clown with all that product caking up in your pores. Start with a good primer because, trust me, no one wants to see your foundation melting off in the middle of the day.\n\nNow, grab your foundation. Don't go cheap here; you want something that blends seamlessly into your skin tone. Dab it on with a beauty sponge or a brush\u2014no need to go heavy-handed, or you'll look like you're wearing a mask. Blend, blend, blend until it looks natural. No one likes a harsh line between their neck and face.\n\nNext up, the concealer. You know where your dark circles and blemishes are, right? Well, cover them up, but don\u2019t be obvious about it. Use a lighter shade under your eyes and a matching shade for any other spots. Pat it in gently; you don\u2019t want it to settle into fine lines.\n\nEyeshadow is where you can get creative, but keep it simple if you\u2019re new. A neutral palette will always do the trick. Apply the lightest color all over your lid as a base. Then add a darker shade in the crease for depth. But remember, less is more. You don\u2019t want to look like you\u2019ve got dirt under your eyes.\n\nEyeliner? Oh, eyeliner! It\u2019s tricky, but it\u2019s so worth it. Stay close to your lash line, and try not to wing it too much unless you\u2019re going for a dramatic look. And mascara? Mascara is your best friend. Curl those lashes, and coat them generously. Falsies are optional, but they can really open up your eyes.\n\nLips? Lipstick, lip gloss, lip liner\u2014it's all fair game. Go for a nude or a bold red, depending on how daring you feel. Just make sure it matches your skin tone and complements your outfit.\n\nAnd there you have it, sweetheart. Now go out there and look fabulous, but don't forget to take off your makeup before bed.

It is characterized by its reliance on a process involving contradiction between opposing sides, similar to other dialectical methods. However, Hegel's approach is unique in how it integrates this process into his broader philosophical framework.\n\nIn Hegel's view, the dialectical process involves three stages: thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. The thesis is an initial proposition or viewpoint. The antithesis is a reaction against the thesis, often presenting a contradictory perspective. The synthesis then emerges from the tension between the thesis and antithesis, resolving the conflict and creating a new understanding that incorporates elements of both initial positions. This process is not only applied to individual arguments but also serves as a foundational concept in Hegel's understanding of history and logic.\n\nHegel believed that history is not merely a series of events, battles, and dates, but a logical progression driven by the dialectical movement of ideas. According to him, the contradictions inherent within society and culture are resolved through historical development, leading to a synthesis that represents a higher stage of truth and reality. This continuous unfolding of history through the dialectical process is central to Hegel's philosophy and marks the culmination of systematic philosophy before the rise of more fragmented and critical approaches in later philosophy.\n\nThus, Hegel's dialectic provides a dynamic model for understanding change and development in both thought and society, emphasizing the importance of contradiction and resolution in the evolution of human knowledge and social structures.

This continuous process of thesis (initial idea or state), antithesis (opposing idea or state), and synthesis (resolution and integration of the two) forms the core of Hegel's dialectical approach [1][https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hegel-dialectics/].\n\nThis dialectical model, therefore, provides a way to understand how society and thought evolve through conflict and reconciliation, ultimately leading to progress and higher levels of understanding [2][https://philosophynow.org/issues/140/Hegels_Understanding_of_History].", "input_size": 290, "output_sizes": [289, 284, 359, 264, 316, 361, 339, 296, 281, 363], "output_mean": 315.2, "output_std": 35.62, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 285.25, "p50": 306.0, "p75": 354.0, "p99": 362.82}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 15.52503}, {"sample_id": "e54cdfe27afb8618", "prompt_id": "20f0479dde1311c0", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "I have a website which will be accessed by users only from mobile phones.

Here\u2019s an overview of some approaches you might consider:\n\n### 1. Device Fingerprinting\nDevice fingerprinting involves collecting unique data points from a user's device (such as browser type, operating system, screen resolution, and installed plugins) to create a unique identifier for that device. This identifier can then be checked against a list of approved devices.\n\n- **Pros**: Can be effective in identifying and blocking unauthorized devices.\n- **Cons**: Privacy concerns; it can be difficult to maintain an up-to-date list of authorized devices.\n\n### 2. Mobile Device Management (MDM)\nIf your users are employees or members of an organization, you could implement a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution. MDM allows you to manage and secure mobile devices, ensuring they meet certain security criteria before granting access to corporate resources.\n\n- **Pros**: Provides robust control over device security and compliance.\n- **Cons**: Requires infrastructure setup and management; may not be suitable for public websites.\n\n### 3. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) with Device Verification\nImplement two-factor authentication where the second factor is tied to the device itself. For example, users might need to authenticate via a one-time passcode sent to their device, which would be required each time they attempt to access the site.\n\n- **Pros**: Adds an extra layer of security beyond just username/password.\n- **Cons**: Requires user cooperation and can add complexity to the login process.\n\n### 4. API-Based Approaches\nDevelop an API that checks if the device making the request is authorized. This API could integrate with a database of known good devices or use a third-party service that maintains such a database.\n\n- **Pros**: Customizable and can be integrated into existing systems.\n- **Cons**: Requires development effort and ongoing maintenance.\n\n### Implementation Steps:\n1. **Choose Your Method**: Decide which method best fits your needs based on the pros and cons listed above.\n2. **Set Up Infrastructure**: Depending on your choice, set up the necessary infrastructure. For MDM, this means setting up an MDM server; for device fingerprinting, develop or integrate a fingerprinting tool.\n3. **Define Authorized Devices**: Create a whitelist of authorized devices or define the criteria for authorized devices.\n4. **Integrate with Website**: Ensure your chosen method integrates seamlessly with your website. This might involve modifying your login process or adding middleware to handle authorization requests.\n5. **Test Thoroughly**: Before going live, thoroughly test the new access control mechanism to ensure it works as expected without causing undue inconvenience to legitimate users.\n\n### Considerations:\n- **User Experience**: Make sure that the access restrictions do not overly complicate or frustrate legitimate users.\n- **Scalability**: Ensure that whatever solution you choose can scale as your user base grows.\n- **Security vs. Convenience**: Balance the need for security with the convenience of access for authorized users.\n\nImplementing device-specific access controls requires careful planning and consideration of the trade-offs between security, usability, and cost.", "shortest_response": "Restricting access to your website based on authorized devices can be quite complex and typically involves several layers of security measures.

While not foolproof, it can help in identifying unauthorized access attempts.\n\n2. **Mobile Device Management (MDM) Solutions**: If you have a controlled environment where you manage the devices yourself, MDM solutions can enforce policies and restrictions on devices that connect to your network or access your services.\n\n3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Implementing 2FA adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password. It could involve sending a verification code to a known device before allowing access.\n\n4. **Custom App**: Instead of using a web interface, you could develop a custom mobile app for accessing your site.

Here\u2019s a basic guide to help you get started:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your React Project\nFirst, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, create a new React app using Create React App.\n\n```bash\nnpx create-react-app kanban-board\ncd kanban-board\nnpm start\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install Necessary Libraries\nFor drag and drop functionality, you can use `react-beautiful-dnd`. This library simplifies the process of implementing drag and drop interactions.\n\n```bash\nnpm install react-beautiful-dnd\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create Basic Kanban Board Structure\nCreate a basic structure for your Kanban board. You will need columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) and cards within those columns.\n\n#### KanbanBoard Component\nThis component will contain the layout of your Kanban board.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { DragDropContext } from 'react-beautiful-dnd';\nimport Column from './Column';\n\nconst KanbanBoard = () => {\n    const [columns, setColumns] = React.useState({\n        'to-do': ['Task 1', 'Task 2'],\n        'in-progress': [],\n        'done': []\n    });\n\n    const onDragEnd = (result) => {\n        const { destination, source, draggableId } = result;\n\n        if (!destination) return;\n        if (\n            destination.droppableId === source.droppableId &&\n            destination.index === source.index\n        ) {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        const start = columns[source.droppableId];\n        const finish = columns[destination.droppableId];\n\n        if (start === finish) {\n            const newTaskIds = Array.from(start.taskIds);\n            newTaskIds.splice(source.index, 1);\n            newTaskIds.splice(destination.index, 0, draggableId);\n\n            const newColumn = {\n                ...start,\n                taskIds: newTaskIds,\n            };\n\n            setColumns({\n                ...columns,\n                [newColumn.id]: newColumn,\n            });\n        } else {\n            const startTaskIds = Array.from(start.taskIds);\n            startTaskIds.splice(source.index, 1);\n            const newStart = {\n                ...start,\n                taskIds: startTaskIds,\n            };\n\n            const finishTaskIds = Array.from(finish.taskIds);\n            finishTaskIds.splice(destination.index, 0, draggableId);\n            const newFinish = {\n                ...finish,\n                taskIds: finishTaskIds,\n            };\n\n            setColumns({\n                ...columns,\n                [newStart.id]: newStart,\n                [newFinish.id]: newFinish,\n            });\n        }\n    };\n\n    return (\n        <DragDropContext onDragEnd={onDragEnd}>\n            <div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>\n                {Object.entries(columns).map(([id, column]) => (\n                    <Column key={id} id={id} tasks={column.taskIds} />\n                ))}\n            </div>\n        </DragDropContext>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default KanbanBoard;\n```\n\n#### Column Component\nThis component represents each column in the Kanban board.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Droppable } from 'react-beautiful-dnd';\nimport Task from './Task';\n\nconst Column = ({ id, tasks }) => {\n    return (\n        <div style={{ width: '250px', height: '400px', border: '1px solid black', padding: '16px', marginRight: '16px' }}>\n            <h2>{id}</h2>\n            <Droppable droppableId={id}>\n                {(provided) => (\n                    <div ref={provided.innerRef} {...provided.droppableProps}>\n                        {tasks.map((task, index) => (\n                            <Task key={task} text={task} index={index} />\n                        ))}\n                        {provided.placeholder}\n                    </div>\n                )}\n            </Droppable>\n        </div>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default Column;\n```\n\n#### Task Component\nThis component represents individual tasks within each column.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Draggable } from 'react-beautiful-dnd';\n\nconst Task = ({ text, index }) => {\n    return (\n        <Draggable draggableId={text} index={index}>\n            {(provided) => (\n                <div\n                    ref={provided.innerRef}\n                    {...provided.draggableProps}\n                    {...provided.dragHandleProps}\n                    style={{\n                        userSelect: 'none',\n                        padding: '8px',\n                        margin: '2px 0',\n                        backgroundColor: '#f9f9f9',\n                        border: '1px solid #ddd',\n                        borderRadius: '4px'\n                    }}\n                >\n                    {text}\n                </div>\n            )}\n        </Draggable>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default Task;\n```\n\n### Step 4: Style Your Kanban Board\nAdd some CSS to style your Kanban board.

Use at least one example, and write for a well-informed audience. Demonstrate skillful cohesion and paragraphing, using a wide range of vocabulary, structures and language. The essay questions is:\n\nSome believe that nuclear weapons benefit the world at large.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?", "longest_response": "### Nuclear Weapons: A Double-Edged Sword\n\nThe debate surrounding the role of nuclear weapons in global security has long been contentious, with proponents arguing that these weapons serve as a deterrent to potential aggressors, thereby maintaining peace. Conversely, critics contend that the existence of such weapons poses an existential threat to humanity. This essay will explore the proposition that nuclear weapons benefit the world at large, examining both the historical context and contemporary implications to argue that while nuclear deterrence may have played a stabilizing role in the past, the risks they pose today far outweigh any perceived benefits.\n\n#### Historical Deterrence Theory\n\nOne of the primary arguments in favor of nuclear weapons is their purported role in deterring aggression. During the Cold War, the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) was central to U.S. and Soviet foreign policy. The principle behind MAD is that if both sides possess enough nuclear weapons to inflict catastrophic damage on each other, neither side would risk initiating a conflict. This theory posited that the mere existence of nuclear arsenals prevented direct military confrontation between superpowers. For instance, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 is often cited as a case where nuclear deterrence prevented a full-scale war. Both the United States and the Soviet Union backed down from the brink of nuclear conflict, demonstrating the power of nuclear deterrence in maintaining global stability.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of nuclear deterrence is not without its limitations. Critics argue that the concept of MAD relies heavily on rational decision-making, which may not always be the case in times of crisis. Furthermore, the proliferation of nuclear weapons to non-state actors and rogue states complicates the deterrence calculus. Organizations like Al-Qaeda and terrorist groups do not operate within traditional state frameworks, making it difficult to apply the same logic of deterrence that worked between nation-states.\n\n#### Contemporary Risks and Challenges\n\nIn the contemporary era, the proliferation of nuclear technology and materials poses significant risks. Countries such as North Korea and Iran are developing nuclear capabilities, increasing the likelihood of regional instability and conflict. Moreover, the possibility of nuclear materials falling into the hands of terrorists remains a grave concern. The 2004 report by the Nuclear Threat Initiative highlighted the vulnerabilities in securing nuclear materials globally, underscoring the need for stringent safeguards.\n\nAdditionally, the environmental and humanitarian consequences of nuclear warfare cannot be overstated. A single nuclear detonation could lead to devastating health impacts, including radiation sickness and cancer. Furthermore, the long-term ecological damage, such as the contamination of water sources and soil, can have lasting effects on human and animal populations. The 1982 report by the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) detailed the medical and environmental hazards associated with nuclear explosions, reinforcing the argument against the use of such weapons.\n\n#### Ethical Considerations and Alternatives\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the possession and deployment of nuclear weapons raise profound moral questions. The use of nuclear weapons inherently involves mass civilian casualties, which many argue violates the principles of just war theory. Proponents of nuclear disarmament, such as the Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), advocate for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. They argue that reliance on nuclear deterrence perpetuates a dangerous arms race and diverts resources from addressing pressing global issues like climate change and poverty.\n\nMoreover, alternative strategies for maintaining international security exist. Strengthening conventional military forces, enhancing diplomatic relations, and fostering economic interdependence can serve as effective deterrents to conflict. The European Union's success in promoting peace through economic integration provides a model for how nations can build mutual interests rather than relying on the threat of annihilation.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nWhile nuclear weapons have historically played a role in deterring major conflicts between superpowers, the risks they pose today\u2014particularly in terms of proliferation, terrorism, and environmental devastation\u2014far outweigh any perceived benefits. The ethical implications of their use further undermine their legitimacy as tools of international security. As we move forward, it is imperative to pursue comprehensive disarmament and develop alternative strategies for ensuring global peace and stability. The goal should be to eliminate the very possibility of nuclear warfare, not merely to manage the risks associated with it.", "shortest_response": "### Nuclear Weapons: A Deterrent or a Menace?\n\nThe debate surrounding nuclear weapons has long been polarized, with proponents arguing that these weapons serve as a deterrent against global conflict and thus benefit the world at large. Critics, on the other hand, contend that the possession of such destructive power poses an existential threat to humanity and undermines global security. This essay will examine the argument that nuclear weapons benefit the world, focusing on their role in deterring aggression, while also critically assessing the risks they pose to global stability and human survival.\n\n#### Nuclear Weapons as a Deterrent\n\nOne of the primary arguments in favor of nuclear weapons is their ability to act as a deterrent against military aggression. The concept of deterrence hinges on the principle that no rational actor would launch a nuclear strike if it were guaranteed to result in mutual annihilation. This theory was famously encapsulated during the Cold War era, where the United States and the Soviet Union maintained large nuclear arsenals to prevent direct conflict between them. The doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) ensured that neither side could gain a decisive advantage through nuclear warfare, thereby maintaining a fragile peace.\n\nThe success of MAD can be exemplified by the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. When the Soviet Union attempted to deploy missiles in Cuba, bringing the world perilously close to nuclear war, the United States responded with a naval blockade and diplomatic pressure. Ultimately, the crisis was resolved without any nuclear exchange, largely due to the fear of catastrophic consequences that both superpowers shared. This event underscores how the mere presence of nuclear weapons can prevent direct military confrontation and preserve global stability.\n\n#### Risks and Challenges\n\nDespite the apparent benefits of nuclear deterrence, there are significant risks associated with the proliferation and deployment of these weapons. One of the most pressing concerns is the possibility of accidental or unauthorized use. In 1983, for instance, a Soviet early warning system erroneously detected incoming American missiles. Fortunately, Stanislav Petrov, the duty officer, exercised his judgment and did not escalate the situation, averting a potential nuclear disaster. Such incidents highlight the fragility of nuclear command and control systems and the inherent dangers of relying on these weapons for security.\n\nMoreover, the existence of nuclear weapons fuels arms races and encourages states to pursue their own nuclear capabilities. This proliferation increases the likelihood of regional conflicts escalating into nuclear confrontations. For example, tensions between India and Pakistan have repeatedly raised fears of nuclear conflict, particularly over disputed territories like Kashmir. The risk of miscalculation or miscommunication in such scenarios cannot be overstated, making the global landscape more volatile and dangerous.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while nuclear weapons may provide a form of deterrence that helps maintain global peace, their existence poses significant risks to international security and human survival. The argument that nuclear weapons benefit the world at large is compelling but incomplete. The potential for catastrophic accidents, unauthorized launches, and regional conflicts escalates the overall danger to humanity. Therefore, while acknowledging the role of nuclear deterrence in preventing direct superpower conflict, it is imperative to recognize the broader threats posed by these weapons. Efforts towards disarmament and the establishment of robust verification mechanisms should remain a priority to ensure a safer and more stable world for future generations.", "input_size": 113, "output_sizes": [851, 832, 774, 711, 677, 660, 668, 674, 666, 706], "output_mean": 721.9, "output_std": 67.86, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 669.5, "p50": 691.5, "p75": 758.25, "p99": 849.29}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 37.27135}, {"sample_id": "2685895140da0588", "prompt_id": "68c8b4f059df6c74", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "How do I adapt an open source chrome extension, such as ShareGPT, to a safari extension that can run on iOS?", "longest_response": "Adapting an open-source Chrome extension like ShareGPT to work as a Safari extension on iOS involves several steps and considerations due to the differences in the web extension APIs and the platform-specific limitations of Safari and iOS. Here\u2019s a general guide to help you get started:\n\n### 1. **Understand the Differences**\n   - **API Differences**: Chrome and Safari use different APIs for extensions. Chrome uses the Manifest V2 or V3 format, while Safari has its own API and manifest format.\n   - **Platform Limitations**: iOS has stricter security and privacy controls compared to desktop browsers.

No need more any comments.\n\nCompetitive Pressures Stemming from Supplier Bargaining Power\nWhether the suppliers of industry members represent a weak or strong competitive force depends on the degree to which suppliers have sufficient bargaining power to influence the terms and conditions of supply in their favor. Suppliers with strong bargaining power are a source of competitive pressure because of their ability to charge industry members higher prices, pass costs on to them, and limit their opportunities to find better deals. For instance, Microsoft and Intel, both of which supply PC makers with essential com- ponents, have been known to use their dominant market status not only to charge PC makers premium prices but also to leverage their power over PC makers in other ways. The bargaining power of these two companies over their customers is so great that both companies have faced antitrust charges on numerous occasions. Prior to a legal agree- ment ending the practice, Microsoft pressured PC makers to load only Microsoft prod- ucts on the PCs they shipped. Intel has defended itself against similar antitrust charges, but in filling orders for newly introduced Intel chips, it continues to give top priority to PC makers that use the biggest percentages of Intel chips in their PC models. Being on Intel\u2019s list of preferred customers helps a PC maker get an early allocation of Intel\u2019s latest chips and thus allows the PC maker to get new models to market ahead of rivals.\nSmall-scale retailers often must contend with the power of manufacturers whose products enjoy well-known brand names, since consumers expect to find these prod- ucts on the shelves of the retail stores where they shop. This provides the manufacturer with a degree of pricing power and often the ability to push hard for favorable shelf dis- plays. Supplier bargaining power is also a competitive factor in industries where unions have been able to organize the workforce (which supplies labor). Air pilot unions, for example, have employed their bargaining power to increase pilots\u2019 wages and benefits in the air transport industry. The growing clout of the largest healthcare union in the United States has led to better wages and working conditions in nursing homes.", "longest_response": "Memorized", "shortest_response": "Memorized", "input_size": 461, "output_sizes": [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], "output_mean": 4.0, "output_std": 0.0, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 4.0, "p50": 4.0, "p75": 4.0, "p99": 4.0}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 0.47577}, {"sample_id": "85accdc27e08571f", "prompt_id": "c6562e27baaa5e0c", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "{\"uninitvar\": {\"lines:removed\": [-2, -21, -21, -18, -3, -3, 0, -11, -66, -52, -9, 0, -21, -21, -27, 0, 0, -56, -5, -311, -311, -13, -13, -1, -4, -8, -8, -68, -26, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -50, -8, -96, -8, 0, -1, -12, -1, -217, -217, -31, -1, -24, -24, -24, -24, -24, -137, -53, -53, -9, 0, 0, 0, -4, -7, -23, -26, 0, 0, -7, 0, -2, -6, -3, 0, 0, 0, 0, -90, -199, 0, -24, -25, 0, 0, 0, -155, -41, -53, -29, -21, -13, -5, -53, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2, 0, -66, -63, -23, 0, 0, -2, -14, 0, -34, -9, -9, 0, -15, -1, -4, -13, -13, -38, -110, -2, 0, 0, 0, -98, -3, 0, -2, -31, -31, -31, -25, -2, -39, -89, -212, 0, -26, -25, -68, -39, -28, 0, -2, -2, -1, -62, -155, -41, -66, -29, -59, -2, -35, -23, -136, -158, -719, -637, -9, -56, -599, -599, -599, -16, -8, -19, -53, -2, 0, 0, 0, -4, -65, -10, -10, -10, 0, -12, -2, -61, -189, -245, -246, -75, -92, -92, -92, -28, -6, -4, -21, -21, 0, -21, -21, -18, -3, -3, 0, -21, -21, -4, -4, -9, -2, -4, -75, 0, 0, 0, -12, -64, -2, 0, -125, -8, -32, -39, -43, -51, -51, -51, -21, 0, -44, 0, -16, -16, 0, -24, -24, -24, -24, 0, 0, 0, 0, -12, -12, -2, 0, -8, -8, -14, -29, -51, -51, -51, -30, -29, -29, -3, 0, -16, -8, -20, 0, -21, -21, -18, -28, -2, -41, -3, -3, -2, -2, -5, -5, -2, -2, -2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -63, -2, -19, -19, -19, -1, -8, -13, 0, -11, 0, -2, -3, 0, 0, 0, -2, 0, 0, -1508, 0, -22, -5, -37, -25, -7, -1, 0, -6, -29, -24, -8, -2, -110, -11, -21, -21, -3, -3, -2, -18, -1, -54, -16, -40, -40, -40, -2, -4, -3, -1, -1, -1, -5, -170, -15, -15, -10, -10, -11, -11, 0, -1, -151, 0, 0, -44], \"lines:added\": [2, 39, 39, 9, 3, 3, 14, 26, 76, 25, 10, 2, 35, 35, 26, 0, 0, 56, 4, 420, 420, 136, 136, 1, 7, 39, 8, 100, 133, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 50, 8, 100, 8, 0, 2, 9, 1, 143, 143, 73, 1, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 6, 94, 94, 11, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 19, 13, 0, 0, 1, 0, 4, 44, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 173, 176, 3, 28, 1, 0, 0, 0, 71, 42, 185, 15, 16, 19, 5, 51, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 138, 4, 6, 0, 0, 2, 25, 0, 175, 8, 8, 0, 57, 1, 3, 13, 13, 46, 132, 2, 0, 0, 0, 50, 3, 0, 2, 17, 17, 17, 26, 1, 45, 207, 185, 3, 37, 1, 170, 77, 32, 0, 2, 2, 1, 65, 71, 42, 263, 15, 36, 0, 39, 24, 117, 104, 292, 300, 8, 44, 599, 599, 599, 14, 8, 32, 51, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 91, 10, 10, 10, 0, 18, 2, 138, 285, 79, 80, 87, 121, 121, 121, 54, 2, 1, 13, 13, 0, 39, 39, 9, 3, 3, 0, 39, 39, 15, 4, 9, 2, 4, 227, 0, 0, 0, 25, 109, 2, 0, 60, 11, 33, 38, 93, 145, 145, 145, 42, 0, 68, 0, 16, 16, 0, 56, 56, 56, 56, 0, 0, 0, 0, 18, 46, 4, 0, 56, 56, 18, 17, 145, 145, 145, 38, 38, 88, 12, 0, 14, 28, 27, 0, 39, 39, 17, 27, 5, 64, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 7, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 66, 21, 55, 55, 55, 1, 28, 38, 0, 12, 0, 25, 10, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1180, 0, 4, 6, 73, 31, 24, 1, 0, 3, 9, 24, 2, 32, 106, 11, 39, 39, 3, 3, 6, 9, 1, 8, 22, ", "longest_response": "It appears that you've provided a partial diff (difference) report, likely from a version control system like Git, showing lines that were removed and added in a file.

Also, what is it that we\u2019re offering and why does the customer want it. What does the service look like? Do we have the team in place to make it happen? Who are we competing against?

This means that users write code to define their 3D objects rather than manipulating them directly through a graphical user interface.\n\nOpenSCAD supports two main types of modeling:\n\n1. **CAD-Type Modeling**: Here, you use code to create precise geometric shapes and then combine or modify these shapes to create complex models.\n2. **Scripting**: OpenSCAD also allows for the creation of parametric models using scripts.

Use some example that can be understood by a high school student3", "longest_response": "Sure! Let's break down these concepts in a way that's easy to understand using examples from everyday life.\n\n### Prototype\n\nIn Swift (and many other programming languages), a prototype is like a template or a blueprint for creating objects. Imagine you're building toy cars. Instead of designing each car from scratch, you might have a prototype that shows all the features and specifications of your toy car. Once you have this prototype, you can use it to make as many copies of the car as you want.\n\n#### Example in Swift:\nLet's say you want to create a class called `Car` in Swift. This class will act as a prototype for different types of cars:\n\n```swift\nclass Car {\n    var color: String\n    var model: String\n    \n    init(color: String, model: String) {\n        self.color = color\n        self.model = model\n    }\n    \n    func startEngine() {\n        print(\"The \\(model) car's engine started.\")\n    }\n}\n\n// Using the Car prototype to create two different cars\nlet myRedCar = Car(color: \"Red\", model: \"Ford Mustang\")\nlet myBlueCar = Car(color: \"Blue\", model: \"Chevrolet Camaro\")\n\nmyRedCar.startEngine() // Outputs: The Ford Mustang car's engine started.\n```\n\nHere, `Car` is our prototype, and we used it to create two instances (`myRedCar` and `myBlueCar`) with specific attributes.\n\n### Delegate\n\nA delegate in Swift is an object that acts on behalf of another object. Think of it like a friend who takes care of your responsibilities when you're away. For example, if you're busy, you might ask your friend to pick up your mail. Your friend becomes the delegate for that task.\n\nIn programming, a delegate is often used to handle tasks or events that happen in one part of your code but need to be managed by another part of your code.\n\n#### Example in Swift:\nImagine you have a `MessageSender` class that sends messages. However, you want to know when a message has been successfully sent or if there was an error. To do this, you could define a protocol that the `MessageSender` can use to communicate back to another class (like a `MessageReceiver`).\n\nFirst, let's define a protocol called `MessageDelegate`:\n\n```swift\nprotocol MessageDelegate: AnyObject {\n    func messageSentSuccessfully(message: String)\n    func messageSendingFailed(error: Error)\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's create the `MessageSender` class that uses this protocol:\n\n```swift\nclass MessageSender {\n    weak var delegate: MessageDelegate?\n    \n    func sendMessage(message: String) {\n        // Simulate sending a message\n        print(\"Sending message: \\(message)\")\n        \n        // Simulate success\n        if true { // Change to false to simulate failure\n            delegate?.messageSentSuccessfully(message: message)\n        } else {\n            delegate?.messageSendingFailed(error: NSError(domain: \"\", code: 0, userInfo: nil))\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd finally, let's create a `MessageReceiver` class that conforms to the `MessageDelegate` protocol:\n\n```swift\nclass MessageReceiver: MessageDelegate {\n    func messageSentSuccessfully(message: String) {\n        print(\"Message sent successfully: \\(message)\")\n    }\n    \n    func messageSendingFailed(error: Error) {\n        print(\"Error sending message: \\(error.localizedDescription)\")\n    }\n    \n    func sendAMessage() {\n        let sender = MessageSender()\n        sender.delegate = self\n        sender.sendMessage(message: \"Hello, world!\")\n    }\n}\n\n// Create an instance of MessageReceiver and send a message\nlet receiver = MessageReceiver()\nreceiver.sendAMessage()\n```\n\nIn this example, `MessageReceiver` acts as the delegate for `MessageSender`. When `MessageSender` sends a message, it calls back to `MessageReceiver` to notify whether the message was sent successfully or if there was an error.\n\nBy understanding prototypes and delegates, you can design more flexible and modular Swift applications.", "shortest_response": "Sure! Let's break down the concepts of \"prototype\" and \"delegate\" in Swift using simple examples that a high school student might understand.\n\n### Prototype\n\nIn Swift, a **prototype** is like a blueprint or a template for creating objects (instances). It defines the properties (like variables) and methods (functions) that an object will have. When you create a new object from this blueprint, it follows all the rules defined in the prototype.\n\nImagine you're building a model airplane. The prototype would be like the design or pattern you follow to build your airplane. Every airplane you build from this prototype will look similar but can have its own unique details.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple Swift example:\n\n```swift\nclass Animal {\n    var name: String\n    \n    init(name: String) {\n        self.name = name\n    }\n    \n    func makeSound() {\n        print(\"Some generic animal sound\")\n    }\n}\n\nlet dog = Animal(name: \"Buddy\")\nprint(dog.name)  // Output: Buddy\ndog.makeSound()  // Output: Some generic animal sound\n```\n\nIn this example, `Animal` is the prototype. We use it to create an instance called `dog`. The `Animal` class has a property `name` and a method `makeSound`.\n\n### Delegate\n\nA **delegate** is an object that acts on behalf of another object. It's like having a friend who can do things for you when you're busy or not around. In Swift, delegates are often used to handle events or actions that happen in one part of an app but need to be handled by another part of the app.\n\nThink of it like a teacher assigning a task to a student. The teacher (the delegating object) gives the task to the student (the delegate), who then completes the task according to the instructions given.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple Swift example:\n\n```swift\nprotocol TaskDelegate {\n    func taskCompleted(taskName: String)\n}\n\nclass Teacher {\n    var delegate: TaskDelegate?\n    \n    func assignTask(taskName: String) {\n        print(\"Assigning task: \\(taskName)\")\n        if let delegate = delegate {\n            delegate.taskCompleted(taskName: taskName)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass Student: TaskDelegate {\n    func taskCompleted(taskName: String) {\n        print(\"Task completed: \\(taskName)\")\n    }\n}\n\nlet teacher = Teacher()\nlet student = Student()\n\nteacher.delegate = student\nteacher.assignTask(taskName: \"Math Homework\")\n// Output:\n// Assigning task: Math Homework\n// Task completed: Math Homework\n```\n\nIn this example, `Teacher` is the delegating object, and `Student` is the delegate. The `Teacher` assigns a task and uses the `delegate` to inform the `Student` about the task completion. The `Student` then performs the action as instructed.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Prototype**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects.\n- **Delegate**: An object that handles tasks or actions on behalf of another object, allowing for flexible and modular code design.\n\nBoth concepts help in organizing code and making it more manageable and reusable.", "input_size": 55, "output_sizes": [663, 827, 648, 643, 782, 714, 751, 743, 719, 769], "output_mean": 725.9, "output_std": 57.65, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 675.75, "p50": 731.0, "p75": 764.5, "p99": 822.95}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 34.91629}, {"sample_id": "f7e7897c72642c08", "prompt_id": "a2560e6792f2be83", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "why does whiskey needed copper distiller?", "longest_response": "Whiskey requires a copper distiller for several reasons, primarily related to the purification and enhancement of its flavor profile during the distillation process:\n\n1. **Removal of Sulfur Compounds**: Copper helps in removing sulfur compounds from the distillate.

Distillers have found that copper contributes positively to the quality of the spirit, and this practice has been passed down through generations.\n\nWhile copper is the most common material used in distillation equipment due to these benefits, some modern distilleries may experiment with other materials or designs to achieve specific flavor profiles.

Copper reacts with these compounds to form copper sulfides, which are then removed during the distillation process.\n\n2. **Heat Transfer**: Copper is an excellent conductor of heat. This means it helps in efficiently heating and cooling the liquid during distillation, ensuring that the alcohol vaporizes at the right temperature and condenses back into liquid form without losing too much flavor.\n\n3. **Enhancing Flavor**: Some distillers believe that the interaction between the copper and the spirit can enhance the overall flavor profile of the whiskey, although this is somewhat debated within the industry.\n\n4. **Removing Off-Flavors**: In addition to sulfur compounds, copper can also help remove other unwanted elements from the spirit, contributing to a smoother taste.\n\nFor these reasons, copper has been traditionally used in the construction of stills for making whiskey and many other distilled spirits.", "input_size": 37, "output_sizes": [290, 279, 253, 250, 283, 276, 216, 223, 284, 282], "output_mean": 263.6, "output_std": 25.36, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 250.75, "p50": 277.5, "p75": 282.75, "p99": 289.46}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 10.41815}, {"sample_id": "b3866d747bcdad9b", "prompt_id": "fd8beec3af34335a", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Research and analyse the disaster management cycle of a particular region/country and identify the challenges\nand opportunities in each phase of the cycle.

They cannot be flipped, and to be flipped would be cataclysm.\u201d This coincides with observations made by TORFMA studies, throughout history, demonstrating that there are realms that mankind cannot always interact with. \n\nThe \u2018Door, Lock, Key and Room\u2019 theory created by the Elven Auristas magic practitioner Gus Philippe frames the three dimensions as such. The Corporworld is the body of the lock, meanwhile the essence of a creature (section 3.0) acts as the key to the door, the Manaworld. However, on top of it all, is the space behind the door, the Duinnworld. This section will briefly discuss each realm in order of least-impact to most impact, and its effects on its subsidiaries.\n\n3.1 Corporworld\nThe least impactful, but most important of the four cardinal dimensions is the Corporworld, or the \u2018tangible dimension.\u2019 This is the dimension in which you, the reader, are currently in. Not only does it act as a bridge between the Manaworld and Duinnworld, it acts as a residence for any creature within the realms. It is proven that life is stunted in creatures with a lessened connection to the Manaworld, hence why mages experience fatigue after long spell-casting sessions. The other realms facilitate the act, whereas the Corporworld is where it all happens.\n3.2 Manaworld\nThe second least impactful but most observed outside of course, the Corporworld, is the Manaworld. Throughout history on various Hubworlds, similarities have been drawn between this dimension and \u2018the afterlife \u2019 in most cultures, but regardless, religious debate is not the purpose of this report. The Manaworld is the resource that facilitates spell-casting, and can be adversely affected by uses of it in the corporworld. A common phenomenon witnessed in locations of mass spell-casting, loss of life or battle is \u2018manaworld deviation,\u2019 where a concavity or simply put, dent, is made in the fabric of the dimension, permitting the welling of Mana particles. If it is a concavity causing increase in density of mana particles, it is known as a \u2018positive manaworld deviation (PMD), and if a convexity is caused making mana particles leave the area, it is a \u2018negative manaworld deviation\u2019 (NMD).\n\n3.2.1 Manaworld Functions, and Mana-Tides\nMethods of entering the Manaworld have been manufactured, but are highly discouraged as the typical essence is incapable of withstanding \u2018Mana-Tides.\u2019 Examples of types of magic that do not simply pull mana particles from the Manaworld, but utilize the very dimension\u2019s functions, include on a basic level, mana-sensory magic, and on a complex level, time magic. While the former poses little risk to the user due to simply linking the senses to the dimension, the latter is significantly discouraged due to the risks on the user.\n\nMana-Tides are a natural phenomenon in the Manaworld that rejuvenate particles roughly every 48 hours. They act as a large brush, or riptide, hence the name, where any particle or essence too weak to withstand it is swept into a sub-layer of the dimension known as the Manaworld Void, from which it is incredibly difficult to return, especially without permanent repercussions to the essence. The Void is unexplored, and undocumented.\n3.3 Duinnworld\nThe most impactful of the three dimensions is the Duinnworld, affecting the Manaworld and consequently the Corporworld. Due to only previous prodigies being able to enter the Duinnworld, the characteristics of this dimension are fairly unknown. It is observed that while duinn functions similarly to magic, it is an entirely independent force that simply has the capability of manipulating mana. Based on information from many generations ago, the Duinnworld is a much more stable, time dilated dimension that actually facilitates the growth of magic aptitude. It can also be assumed that much like Duinn itself, the duinnworld reacts to emotion and has some sort of conscience.\"", "longest_response": "The text you've shared delves into an intriguing framework for understanding the interplay between different dimensions within a magical universe. Let's break down the key points and explore their implications:\n\n### 3.0 The Three Cardinal Dimensions\n\n#### Looped Filter Theory\nThis theory, proposed by Richard Sitzgen, suggests that the components of the universe are layered like colored filters, each layer affecting those below it. Flipping these layers could result in catastrophic consequences, highlighting the delicate balance and interconnectedness of these dimensions.\n\n#### Door, Lock, Key, and Room Theory\nGus Philippe's theory provides a metaphorical representation of the three dimensions:\n- **Corporworld**: The 'lock' or physical world where tangible interactions occur.\n- **Manaworld**: The 'key' that allows access to magical abilities.\n- **Duinnworld**: The 'room' beyond the door, representing the most influential and mysterious dimension.\n\n### 3.1 Corporworld\n\nThis is the dimension we perceive directly, serving as a bridge between the Manaworld and Duinnworld. It's essential because it's where magical actions manifest physically. Life's vitality is linked to the Manaworld; thus, prolonged use of magic can lead to fatigue.\n\n### 3.2 Manaworld\n\nAs the source of magical power, the Manaworld is crucial for spellcasting. It can be affected by events in the Corporworld, leading to phenomena such as positive (PMD) and negative (NMD) manaworld deviations. These deviations can alter the concentration of mana particles, impacting magical activities.\n\n#### Manaworld Functions and Mana-Tides\n- **Mana-Tides**: Periodic rejuvenation events in the Manaworld that occur every 48 hours. Weak essences or particles can be swept into the Manaworld Void, a perilous sub-layer.\n- **Mana-Sensory Magic**: Allows linking to the Manaworld without significant risk.\n- **Time Magic**: Highly discouraged due to severe risks to the user.\n\n### 3.3 Duinnworld\n\nThe most impactful dimension, the Duinnworld influences both the Manaworld and Corporworld. Access is extremely rare, limited to prodigies. It appears to be a stable, time-dilated environment that enhances magical ability. Emotion seems to play a role in how the Duinnworld operates, hinting at a form of consciousness or responsiveness.\n\n### Implications and Further Exploration\n\n- **Interdimensional Balance**: Understanding the interplay between these dimensions could provide insights into managing magical resources and preventing catastrophic events.\n- **Magical Education**: Developing safer methods to harness mana and navigate the Manaworld could revolutionize magical practices.\n- **Duinnworld Research**: Given its profound influence and rarity, studying the Duinnworld could unlock new forms of magic and enhance the understanding of the cosmos.\n\nOverall, this framework offers a rich tapestry for exploring the complexities of a magical universe, emphasizing the importance of balance and the potential dangers of overstepping natural boundaries.", "shortest_response": "This fascinating narrative introduces a layered cosmological model consisting of three main dimensions: the Corporworld, the Manaworld, and the Duinnworld. Each dimension plays a unique role in the structure and function of the universe described, and they interact in intricate ways that affect both magical and mundane aspects of existence.\n\n### Corporworld\n\nThe Corporworld is described as the tangible dimension we are familiar with, serving as the physical plane where beings reside and interact. It acts as a bridge between the Manaworld and Duinnworld, facilitating the practical application of magic and other supernatural abilities. The health and vitality of beings are directly linked to their connection with the Manaworld, indicating that the Corporworld relies heavily on the energy and resources provided by the higher dimensions.\n\n### Manaworld\n\nThe Manaworld is the source of magical power, acting as a reservoir for mana particles that sustain spells and magical abilities. It's influenced by events in the Corporworld, such as battles or mass spell-casting, leading to phenomena like 'Manaworld Deviation,' where the concentration of mana particles changes. Positive deviations (PMD) occur when there's an influx of mana, while negative deviations (NMD) result in a depletion. The Manaworld also experiences natural cycles called 'Mana-Tides' that cleanse and renew the mana particles, though these can be perilous for those not prepared to withstand them.\n\n### Duinnworld\n\nThe Duinnworld is portrayed as the most influential dimension, impacting both the Manaworld and Corporworld. It's described as stable and time-dilated, offering conditions conducive to enhancing magical abilities. Its exact nature remains largely mysterious due to the rarity of individuals capable of accessing it. The Duinnworld is thought to react to emotional states and may possess a form of consciousness, suggesting a deeper, more sentient layer to reality beyond our understanding.\n\n### Interdimensional Dynamics\n\nThe interaction between these dimensions is crucial to the functioning of magic and the universe at large. The Corporworld serves as the interface where magic is applied, while the Manaworld provides the raw materials (mana particles) necessary for spellcasting. The Duinnworld, acting as the foundational layer, supports and potentially shapes the dynamics of the lower dimensions.\n\nThis cosmology offers a rich framework for exploring themes of magic, spirituality, and the interconnection between different planes of existence. It invites further investigation into how these dimensions might influence each other and what implications this has for the beings who inhabit them.", "input_size": 920, "output_sizes": [548, 613, 566, 514, 575, 563, 504, 545, 566, 616], "output_mean": 561.0, "output_std": 34.44, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 545.75, "p50": 564.5, "p75": 572.75, "p99": 615.73}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 36.67762}, {"sample_id": "794a61135833ef8a", "prompt_id": "335623d4f49ae43b", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "what are the unique selling points of peanut butter", "longest_response": "Peanut butter is a popular and versatile food item that offers several unique selling points:\n\n1. **Nutritional Value**: Peanut butter is rich in protein, healthy fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated), vitamins (like vitamin E and B-vitamins), and minerals (such as magnesium and potassium).

To create a React component that fetches data from an API using `react-query`, you first need to install `react-query` if you haven't already. You can do this via npm or yarn:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @tanstack/react-query\n# or\nyarn add @tanstack/react-query\n```\n\nBelow is an example of a simple React component that uses `react-query` to fetch data from an API. This example assumes you have a backend service that provides some data at a specific endpoint.\n\n### Example Component\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';\n\n// Function to fetch data from the API\nconst fetchData = async () => {\n  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    throw new Error('Network response was not ok');\n  }\n  return response.json();\n};\n\nconst DataFetchingComponent = () => {\n  // Use the useQuery hook to fetch data\n  const { isLoading, isError, error, data } = useQuery(['data'], fetchData);\n\n  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;\n  if (isError) return <div>Error: {(error as Error).message}</div>;\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Data from API</h1>\n      <ul>\n        {data.map((item) => (\n          <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default DataFetchingComponent;\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **useQuery**: This hook is used to fetch and manage data from the API. It takes two arguments:\n  - The first argument is a unique key that helps `react-query` to identify the query.\n  - The second argument is a function that makes the actual API call (`fetchData` in this case).\n\n- **isLoading**: This variable will be `true` while the data is being fetched.\n\n- **isError**: If there's an error during the fetch operation, this variable will be `true`.\n\n- **error**: Contains the error object if there was an error.\n\n- **data**: Once the data is successfully fetched, it will be stored in this variable.\n\n- **fetchData**: This is a custom function that performs the HTTP request to the API and returns the JSON response.\n\nThis example assumes the API returns an array of objects where each object has at least `id` and `name` properties. Adjust the code according to your actual API response structure.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Error Handling**: You might want to add more sophisticated error handling depending on your application needs.\n- **Stale Time and Cache**: You can configure how long the data should be considered fresh and when to refetch it using options like `staleTime`, `cacheTime`, etc., available in `useQuery`.\n- **Loading State**: Depending on your application, you might want to show a spinner or other loading indicators while the data is being fetched.\n\nThis should give you a good starting point for integrating `react-query` into your React application for fetching and managing API data efficiently.", "shortest_response": "Certainly! React Query is a popular library for managing asynchronous data in React applications. It simplifies the process of fetching and caching data from APIs.

These operations could include adding new users, retrieving user information, updating user details, or deleting user records.\n   - **Trigger Mechanism**: Initially, the Lambda function might be triggered manually or through scheduled events for testing purposes, but ultimately, it will be invoked through API Gateway requests.\n\n3. **API Gateway Integration**:\n   - **Service**: Amazon API Gateway\n   - **Requirement**: Expose the Lambda function via a RESTful API accessible over HTTP(S).\n   - **Endpoint Creation**: Set up one or more endpoints in API Gateway that map to the Lambda function. For example, `/users` could be used for CRUD operations on user data.\n   - **Security Considerations**: Implement necessary security measures such as API keys, IAM roles, or OAuth 2.0 for securing the API endpoints against unauthorized access.\n   - **CORS Configuration**: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings if the API is intended to be accessed from web applications running in different domains.\n\n4. **Inter-service Communication**:\n   - **Interaction Between Services**: When a request is made to the API Gateway endpoint, it triggers the corresponding Lambda function. The Lambda function then interacts with the DynamoDB table based on the operation specified in the request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n   - **Data Flow**: Data flows from the client to the API Gateway, then to the Lambda function, and finally to the DynamoDB table. Responses flow back from DynamoDB through the Lambda function and back to the client via the API Gateway.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Logging**:\n   - **Service**: Amazon CloudWatch\n   - **Requirement**: Enable logging and monitoring for both the Lambda function and API Gateway to track performance and troubleshoot issues.\n   - **Usage**: Use CloudWatch Logs to capture all logs generated during the execution of the Lambda function and API Gateway requests. Utilize CloudWatch Metrics for monitoring the performance and health of these services.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll create a robust system where user data is securely stored in DynamoDB, managed through a Lambda function, and exposed to users via a secure and scalable API endpoint.", "shortest_response": "Certainly! Here is a detailed breakdown of the requirements, paraphrased into distinct points:\n\n1. **DynamoDB Table Creation**:\n   - **Service**: Amazon DynamoDB\n   - **Purpose**: Store data for XYZ (presumably Users).\n   - **Key Schema**: The primary key will be a `Hash Key` named `id`, which is a string.\n   - **Data Structure**: Define the schema for the table, including the `id` field as the primary key and any additional attributes needed to store user-specific information.\n\n2. **Lambda Function Development**:\n   - **Service**: AWS Lambda\n   - **Purpose**: To interact with the DynamoDB table.\n   - **Functionality**: Implement logic within the Lambda function to perform CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table (Create, Read, Update, Delete).\n   - **Trigger**: The Lambda function should be triggered based on events that occur through the API Gateway or directly invoked from other AWS services.\n\n3. **API Gateway Configuration**:\n   - **Service**: Amazon API Gateway\n   - **Purpose**: Expose the Lambda function to external users over HTTP(S).\n   - **Endpoint**: Create RESTful endpoints in API Gateway to map to the corresponding methods in the Lambda function.\n   - **Integration Type**: Use the Lambda Proxy integration type to pass requests directly to the Lambda function without needing to define the full request mapping templates.\n   - **Security**: Optionally configure authentication mechanisms like API keys, IAM roles, or OAuth to secure the endpoints.\n\n4. **Interaction Flow**:\n   - **User Request**: A user sends a request to the API Gateway endpoint.\n   - **API Gateway Handling**: The API Gateway receives the request and routes it to the appropriate method in the Lambda function.\n   - **Lambda Execution**: The Lambda function processes the request, interacts with the DynamoDB table based on the operation required (e.g., read, write), and returns the response back to the API Gateway.\n   - **Response Delivery**: The API Gateway then delivers the response back to the user who initiated the request.\n\nEach step involves specific AWS services interacting seamlessly to provide a robust solution for storing and accessing user data securely and efficiently.", "input_size": 129, "output_sizes": [444, 549, 508, 597, 523, 493, 636, 518, 586, 469], "output_mean": 532.3, "output_std": 56.86, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 496.75, "p50": 520.5, "p75": 576.75, "p99": 632.49}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 26.59782}, {"sample_id": "a40f41be6c5710b9", "prompt_id": "f0914982fd1fb83d", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Convert the following lecture notes into Q&A format in table.

The solicitors had never acted for the claimant. The decision confirms the court\u2019s approach in considering whether to grant an injunction to restrain solicitors from acting for an opponent where they have received a party\u2019s confidential and privileged information. \n\u00a7 Where the solicitors obtained the information while acting for the party in question, i.e. where the relationship is that of former client, the court will grant an injunction unless the solicitors can show there is no real risk of disclosure. That was established by the House of Lords in Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG [1999] 2 AC 222.\n\u00a7 However, the Bolkiah approach is limited to the former client situation.

Functions and methods are the same. They process data the same way in any programming language.\nB. Functions and methods are the same. They process data exactly the same way in any object-oriented programming language.\nC. Functions and methods are different. A function is called by name and must always pass and return data, whereas a method can only be called when an object of a class calls it.\nD. Functions and methods are different. A function can be called at any time during a programming\nsolution, whereas a method can only be called when an object that has been declared calls it", "longest_response": "The correct answer is D. Functions and methods are indeed different, but they both serve the purpose of encapsulating functionality. A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called from anywhere in your program, given that it's accessible within the scope where you're trying to call it. It doesn't necessarily have to \"pass and return data\" to be a function; it can perform actions without returning anything or even receiving any parameters.\n\nOn the other hand, a method is a function that is associated with an object (or instance) of a class. Methods are typically used to operate on the data that is contained within the object itself or to modify the state of the object. In object-oriented programming, a method is called on an object, like `object.method()`, which means that the method operates on the context provided by the object.\n\nSo, to clarify:\n- A function is a standalone piece of code that can be called from anywhere in your program.\n- A method is a function that is part of an object and is called on that object.\n\nOption C is incorrect because functions do not always require passing and returning data; similarly, methods can receive parameters and return values just like functions can.

Note that Python 2 is no longer officially supported (its support ended in January 2020), so it's recommended to use Python 3 for most purposes. However, if you still need Python 2 for specific reasons, here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n#### 1. Install Homebrew\nIf you haven't installed Homebrew yet, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:\n```bash\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n```\n\nFollow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.\n\n#### 2. Add the Homebrew Tap for Python 2\nHomebrew does not include Python 2 by default because it is no longer supported. However, there is a tap maintained by the Homebrew community that provides Python 2. To add this tap, run:\n```bash\nbrew tap cartr/qt4/python2\n```\n\n#### 3. Install Python 2\nNow, you can install Python 2 with the following command:\n```bash\nbrew install python@2\n```\n\nThis will install Python 2 and its standard library.\n\n#### 4. Verify Installation\nAfter installation, you can verify that Python 2 was installed correctly by checking its version:\n```bash\npython2 --version\n```\n\nOr if you want to use `python` as an alias for Python 2, you might need to set up some additional environment variables or aliases. This is optional but useful if you prefer to type `python` instead of `python2`.\n\n#### 5. Setting Up Aliases (Optional)\nYou can create an alias to use `python` as `python2` in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`). Open your shell configuration file:\n```bash\nopen -a TextEdit ~/.zshrc\n```\nor\n```bash\nopen -a TextEdit ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\nAdd the following lines at the end of the file:\n```bash\nalias python=python2\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/python@2/libexec/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\nSave the file and reload the configuration:\n```bash\nsource ~/.zshrc\n```\nor\n```bash\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\nNow, typing `python` should invoke Python 2.\n\n### Important Notes\n- **Support Status:** Python 2 is no longer supported, which means it won't receive any security updates or bug fixes. Consider upgrading to Python 3.\n- **Compatibility Issues:** Some packages and tools may not be compatible with Python 2 anymore due to its end-of-life status.\n- **Alternative Solutions:** If you need features from Python 2, consider using a virtual environment with Python 2 via Docker or similar containerization tools, or look into libraries like `python-future` which aim to make Python 2 code more compatible with Python 3.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to install Python 2 on your Mac using Homebrew.", "shortest_response": "To install Python 2 using Homebrew on a Mac, you need to follow these steps carefully. Note that Python 2 is no longer maintained and has reached its end of life as of January 1, 2020, so it's generally recommended to use Python 3 for new projects. However, if you specifically need Python 2 for legacy reasons or testing purposes, here\u2019s how you can set it up:\n\n### Prerequisites:\n- Ensure you have Homebrew installed. If not, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal:\n  ```bash\n  /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n  ```\n\n### Installing Python 2 via Homebrew:\n1. **Tap into the \"homebrew/homebrew-versions\" repository** which contains older versions of software, including Python 2.\n   ```bash\n   brew tap homebrew/versions\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Python 2** from this repository.\n   ```bash\n   brew install python2\n   ```\n\n### Verify Installation:\nAfter installation, you should be able to verify that Python 2 is correctly installed by checking its version:\n```bash\npython2 --version\n```\nThis should output something like `Python 2.x.x`.\n\n### Setting Up Virtual Environments (Optional but Recommended):\nIt's a good practice to work within virtual environments to manage dependencies for different projects. For Python 2, you might want to use `virtualenv` or `venv` (though `venv` is more commonly used with Python 3).\n\nTo install `virtualenv`, run:\n```bash\npip2 install virtualenv\n```\n\nThen, create a new virtual environment:\n```bash\nvirtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python2 myenv\nsource myenv/bin/activate\n```\n\nNow, you're working within a Python 2 environment.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- Python 2 is no longer supported by the Python community, which means security updates and bug fixes will not be provided.\n- It's highly recommended to transition to Python 3 for any new development.\n- Many libraries and tools may no longer support Python 2, making it increasingly difficult to maintain projects written in Python 2.\n\nIf you encounter issues during the installation process, ensure your system meets all prerequisites, and consider consulting the latest documentation or community forums for troubleshooting tips specific to your situation.", "input_size": 43, "output_sizes": [637, 560, 600, 580, 653, 545, 561, 502, 563, 564], "output_mean": 576.5, "output_std": 41.8, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 560.25, "p50": 563.5, "p75": 595.0, "p99": 651.56}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 26.14173}, {"sample_id": "877b2eecf1a1763d", "prompt_id": "5a52c3609e33a906", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "i am working on android studio project using java, that is my frontend and for my backend i work in spring boot.

However, since Spring Framework 5.0, the recommended approach is to use the `spring-boot-starter-websocket` and related dependencies along with a client-side library such as `SockJS-client` and `stomp-websocket`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to setting up WebSocket communication from an Android app to a Spring Boot backend using STOMP and SockJS:\n\n### Step 1: Add Dependencies\n\nFirst, ensure you have the necessary dependencies in your Android Studio project. Add these to your `build.gradle` file under the app module:\n\n```gradle\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'org.java-websocket:Java-WebSocket:1.5.2' // Optional if not using SockJS\n    implementation 'org.springframework:spring-websocket:5.3.10' // Use version compatible with your Spring Boot version\n    implementation 'org.webjars:sockjs-client:1.0.2'\n    implementation 'org.webjars:stomp-websocket:2.3.3'\n}\n```\n\nNote: The versions provided above (`5.3.10`, `1.0.2`, `2.3.3`) should be updated to match the latest stable versions of their respective libraries.\n\n### Step 2: Configure WebSockets in Android\n\nCreate a class to handle WebSocket connections. Here\u2019s an example:\n\n```java\nimport org.java_websocket.client.WebSocketClient;\nimport org.java_websocket.handshake.ServerHandshake;\nimport org.springframework.messaging.simp.stomp.StompSession;\nimport org.springframework.messaging.simp.stomp.StompSessionHandlerAdapter;\n\nimport javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory;\nimport javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager;\nimport java.net.URI;\nimport java.security.cert.X509Certificate;\n\npublic class WebSocketConnection {\n\n    private StompSession session;\n\n    public void connect() {\n        try {\n            URI uri = new URI(\"ws://yourserveraddress:port/socket\");\n            WebSocketContainer container = ContainerProvider.getWebSocketContainer();\n            container.connectToServer(new MyStompSessionHandler(), ClientEndpointConfig.Builder.create().build(), uri);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    private class MyStompSessionHandler extends StompSessionHandlerAdapter {\n        @Override\n        public void afterConnected(StompSession session, StompHeaders connectedHeaders) {\n            this.session = session;\n            session.subscribe(\"/topic/messages\", this);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void handleFrame(StompHeaders headers, Object payload) {\n            System.out.println(headers);\n            System.out.println(payload);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor SockJS and STOMP specifically, you would typically use something more like this:\n\n```java\nimport org.java_websocket.client.WebSocketClient;\nimport org.java_websocket.handshake.ServerHandshake;\nimport org.springframework.web.socket.client.standard.StandardWebSocketClient;\nimport org.springframework.web.socket.config.annotation.EnableWebSocketMessageBroker;\nimport org.springframework.web.socket.messaging.WebSocketStompClient;\nimport org.springframework.web.socket.sockjs.client.SockJsTransportCodec;\nimport org.springframework.web.socket.sockjs.client.Transport;\nimport org.springframework.web.socket.sockjs.client.WebSocketTransport;\n\nimport java.net.URI;\nimport java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;\n\npublic class WebSocketConnection {\n\n    public void connect() {\n        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);\n\n        WebSocketTransport transport = new WebSocketTransport(new StandardWebSocketClient());\n        SockJsTransportCodec codec = new SockJsTransportCodec();\n\n        Transport chosenTransport = new WebSocketTransport(new StandardWebSocketClient());\n\n        WebSocketStompClient stompClient = new WebSocketStompClient(chosenTransport);\n        stompClient.setMessageConverter(new MappingJackson2MessageConverter());\n\n        stompClient.connect(URI.create(\"ws://yourserveraddress:port/socket\"), new MyStompSessionHandler(latch));\n    }\n\n    private class MyStompSessionHandler extends StompSessionHandlerAdapter {\n        private final CountDownLatch latch;\n\n        public MyStompSessionHandler(CountDownLatch latch) {\n            this.latch = latch;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void afterConnected(StompSession session, StompHeaders connectedHeaders) {\n            session.subscribe(\"/topic/messages\", this);\n            latch.countDown();\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void handleFrame(StompHeaders headers, Object payload) {\n            System.out.println(headers);\n            System.out.println(payload);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Handle SSL Issues (if applicable)\n\nIf you're connecting over HTTPS, you might need to trust all certificates or configure your own trust manager:\n\n```java\nSSLSocketFactory factory = new SSLSocketFactory(null, new X509TrustManager() {\n    @Override\n    public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) {\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) {\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {\n        return new X509Certificate[0];\n    }\n});\n```\n\nHowever, this is generally not recommended for production environments due to security concerns.\n\n### Step 4: Subscribe to Topics\n\nOnce connected, you can subscribe to topics and send messages as needed:\n\n```java\nsession.subscribe(\"/topic/someTopic\", new MyStompSessionHandler());\nsession.send(\"/app/hello\", \"Hello World!\");\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis setup should allow your Android app to communicate with your Spring Boot backend using WebSocket with STOMP and SockJS. Make sure to replace placeholders like `ws://yourserveraddress:port/socket` with actual values relevant to your setup. Adjust error handling and logging according to your needs.", "shortest_response": "To connect your Android application to the WebSocket server configured with STOMP and SockJS on your Spring Boot backend, you can use the `sockjs-client` and `stompjs` libraries for JavaScript, but since you're developing an Android app, you'll need Java-based libraries. One popular choice is the `SockJS` library for Java along with `Spring for Android`.\n\nHowever, as of now, there isn't a direct Java implementation of `stompjs` or `sockjs-client`. Instead, you can use a combination of `SockJS` for WebSocket fallbacks and `spring-websocket`'s `StompSession` API for handling STOMP messages.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you set this up:\n\n### Step 1: Add Dependencies\n\nAdd the necessary dependencies to your `build.gradle` file for your Android project. You will need at least the `SockJS` client and the `spring-websocket` dependency.\n\n```gradle\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'org.java-websocket:Java-WebSocket:1.5.2'\n    implementation 'org.springframework:spring-websocket:5.3.10' // or any version compatible with your Spring Boot version\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Configure SockJS Client\n\nCreate a class to handle the WebSocket connection and message handling. This example uses `SockJsClient` from `spring-websocket` which supports STOMP over WebSocket and other transports provided by SockJS.\n\n```java\nimport org.java_websocket.client.WebSocketClient;\nimport org.java_websocket.handshake.ServerHandshake;\nimport org.springframework.messaging.simp.stomp.StompFrameHandler;\nimport org.springframework.messaging.simp.stomp.StompHeaders;\nimport org.springframework.messaging.simp.stomp.StompSession;\nimport org.springframework.messaging.simp.stomp.StompSessionHandlerAdapter;\n\nimport java.net.URI;\nimport java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;\n\npublic class MyWebSocketClient {\n\n    private StompSession stompSession;\n\n    public void connect() {\n        URI uri = URI.create(\"ws://your-backend-url/websocket\");\n        CompletableFuture<StompSession> future = Stomp.over(new SockJsClient(Arrays.asList(\n                new WebSocketTransport(new StandardWebSocketClient())\n        )).connect(uri, new StompSessionHandlerAdapter() {\n            @Override\n            public void afterConnected(StompSession session, StompHeaders connectedHeaders) {\n                stompSession = session;\n                System.out.println(\"Connected to WebSocket Server\");\n                subscribeToTopic();\n            }\n        }));\n        stompSession = future.join();\n    }\n\n    private void subscribeToTopic() {\n        stompSession.subscribe(\"/topic/your_topic\", new StompFrameHandler() {\n            @Override\n            public Type getPayloadType(StompHeaders headers) {\n                return String.class;\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public void handleFrame(StompHeaders headers, Object payload) {\n                System.out.println(\"Received message: \" + (String) payload);\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Use the WebSocket Client\n\nNow you can instantiate and use your `MyWebSocketClient` in your Android activity or wherever appropriate in your application.\n\n```java\npublic class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n\n        MyWebSocketClient webSocketClient = new MyWebSocketClient();\n        webSocketClient.connect();\n\n        // Other initialization code...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Notes:\n1. **Security**: Ensure that your WebSocket endpoint is secured properly if you're deploying in a production environment.\n2. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling and reconnection logic as needed.\n3. **Dependencies**: Make sure all required dependencies are correctly added and managed.\n4. **Testing**: Test your WebSocket setup thoroughly, including different network conditions and fallback scenarios.\n\nThis approach should allow you to communicate with your Spring Boot backend's WebSocket server from your Android application effectively.", "input_size": 89, "output_sizes": [942, 948, 928, 1091, 816, 1256, 887, 880, 1176, 1050], "output_mean": 997.4, "output_std": 133.98, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 897.25, "p50": 945.0, "p75": 1080.75, "p99": 1248.8}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 59.80226}, {"sample_id": "d32e9d539550a32a", "prompt_id": "723635ae5081dc9b", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "What are the features and benefits of a modern new website for an existing home renovation contractor that will help attract customers", "longest_response": "A modern website for an existing home renovation contractor can significantly enhance their online presence and attract more customers.

Can you help me on this?", "longest_response": "It sounds like your configuration might be missing some key elements that ensure the FreeRADIUS server waits for the MFA (BSA) process to complete before proceeding with authentication. The issue could be related to how the `bsa` module is integrated into the `authenticate` and `post-auth` sections of your configuration.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to ensure that the MFA (BSA) process completes before moving forward:\n\n### Step 1: Ensure Correct Placement of Modules in `authenticate` Block\n\nMake sure that the `bsa` module is placed correctly in the `authenticate` block so that it is evaluated only after successful LDAP authentication. Also, ensure that the `Auth-Type` is set appropriately.\n\n```plaintext\n# In /etc/freeradius/3.0/sites-available/default\nauthorize {\n    ...\n    # Other authorize modules\n    ...\n}\n\nauthenticate {\n    Auth-Type LDAP {\n        ldap\n    }\n\n    Auth-Type BSA {\n        if (ok) {\n            bsa\n        } else {\n            reject\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Ensure Proper Handling in `post-auth` Block\n\nThe `post-auth` section should handle the response from the `bsa` module correctly. If the `bsa` module fails, it should reject the user. If it succeeds, it should continue processing.\n\n```plaintext\n# In /etc/freeradius/3.0/sites-available/default\npost-auth {\n    ...\n    update control {\n        Cleartext-Password := \"%{Ldap-Password}\"\n    }\n\n    if (\"%{reply:Auth-Type}\" == \"BSA\") {\n        if (ok) {\n            if (\"%{reply:Reply-Message}\" =~ /^.*$/) {\n                update reply {\n                    Reply-Message := \"%{reply:Reply-Message}\"\n                }\n            }\n        } else {\n            update reply {\n                Reply-Message := \"MFA failed\"\n            }\n            reject\n        }\n    } else {\n        # Handle other authentication types here\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Verify `bsa` and `bsa_cancel` Exec Definitions\n\nEnsure that your `bsa` and `bsa_cancel` definitions are correct and that they are properly referenced in the configuration files.\n\n```plaintext\n# In /etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-available/exec\n...\nexec bsa {\n    wait = yes\n    input_pairs = request\n    output_pairs = reply\n    program = \"/usr/bin/java -cp /etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-available/bsa-authenticator/lib/* -Dlogback.configurationFile=/etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-available/bsa-authenticator/config/logback.xml -DbsaType=request -DbsaURL=https://example.com -DbsaClientKey=clientKey -DbsaID='%{User-Name}' com.app.auth.Authenticator\"\n    shell_escape = yes\n    timeout = 30\n}\n\nexec bsa_cancel {\n    wait = yes\n    input_pairs = request\n    output_pairs = reply\n    program = \"/usr/bin/java -cp /etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-available/bsa-authenticator/lib/* -Dlogback.configurationFile=/etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-available/bsa-authenticator/config/logback.xml -DbsaType=cancel -DbsaURL=https://example.com -DbsaClientKey=clientKey -DbsaID='%{User-Name}' com.app.auth.Authenticator\"\n    shell_escape = yes\n    timeout = 30\n}\n...\n```\n\n### Step 4: Enable the `bsa` Module\n\nMake sure the `bsa` module is enabled in your `/etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-enabled` directory or included in your main configuration.\n\n```plaintext\n# Enable the bsa module\nln -s /etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-available/bsa /etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-enabled/\n```\n\n### Step 5: Test Configuration\n\nAfter making these changes, test your configuration using `freeradius -X` to see detailed debug information about what happens during the authentication process. Look for any errors or messages indicating why the MFA process might not be waiting as expected.\n\nIf the issue persists, consider adding more logging within your Java application to understand better where the flow is getting stuck or failing.\n\nBy ensuring that the `bsa` module is correctly configured and placed in the right sections of your FreeRADIUS configuration, you should be able to achieve the desired behavior of waiting for the MFA process to complete before approving the authentication.", "shortest_response": "It sounds like your current configuration might be skipping the BSA (Multi-Factor Authentication) step due to how the `post-auth` section is structured. When you use the `if (ok)` statement, it checks whether the previous module succeeded. If the LDAP module succeeds, it immediately proceeds to the next module or action without waiting for the BSA module to complete its execution.\n\nTo ensure that the BSA module runs after a successful LDAP authentication, you should structure your `post-auth` section more carefully. You want to make sure that the BSA module is called only after a successful LDAP authentication and that it waits for the BSA module to complete before proceeding.\n\nHere's an adjusted version of your `post-auth` block that should address the issue:\n\n```plaintext\npost-auth {\n    ldap\n\n    # Check if LDAP authentication was successful\n    if (ok) {\n        # Proceed to BSA for MFA\n        bsa {\n            # Wait for BSA to complete\n            ok {\n                # Handle successful BSA response\n                update reply {\n                    Reply-Message := \"MFA completed successfully.\"\n                }\n                # Proceed with authentication\n            }\n\n            # Handle failed BSA response\n            fail {\n                update reply {\n                    Reply-Message := \"MFA failed.\"\n                }\n                reject\n            }\n\n            # Handle error from BSA\n            error {\n                update reply {\n                    Reply-Message := \"Error occurred during MFA.\"\n                }\n                reject\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n        # LDAP authentication failed, no need to proceed to BSA\n        update reply {\n            Reply-Message := \"LDAP authentication failed.\"\n        }\n        reject\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis configuration ensures that the BSA module is only invoked when the LDAP module succeeds (`ok`). The BSA module is then expected to run and return either `ok`, `fail`, or `error`. Based on these responses, appropriate actions are taken, such as updating the reply message and deciding whether to accept or reject the authentication attempt.\n\nMake sure that your `bsa` and `bsa_cancel` modules are correctly configured to handle the `ok`, `fail`, and `error` conditions and that they return the correct status codes.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that your Java application running the BSA module is set up to communicate properly with FreeRADIUS and can return these status codes.\n\nLastly, check the logs to see if there are any errors or unexpected behaviors that could provide more insight into why the BSA module might not be completing as expected.", "input_size": 732, "output_sizes": [757, 721, 680, 820, 962, 518, 983, 613, 658, 582], "output_mean": 729.4, "output_std": 146.62, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 624.25, "p50": 700.5, "p75": 804.25, "p99": 981.11}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 57.9801}, {"sample_id": "0902d8c40ff0cfb8", "prompt_id": "fc7c20a57d688175", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Is there anything in scientific literature about active learning in supervised settings?", "longest_response": "Yes, there is a significant body of research on active learning in the context of supervised machine learning. Active learning is a type of semi-supervised learning where a learning algorithm can interactively query a user (or some other information source) to obtain the desired outputs at new data points. This is particularly useful when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.\n\nIn the context of scientific literature, several key aspects and methods related to active learning have been explored:\n\n1. **Query Strategies**: These strategies determine which data points should be queried for labels next. Common strategies include:\n   - **Uncertainty Sampling**: Querying instances where the model is most uncertain.\n   - **Query-by-Committee**: Using an ensemble of models to identify disagreements as candidates for labeling.\n   - **Expected Model Change**: Querying instances that are expected to change the model parameters the most.\n   - **Expected Error Reduction**: Identifying samples that would reduce the model's generalization error the most if labeled.\n\n2. **Theoretical Foundations**: Research has focused on understanding the theoretical limits and guarantees of active learning algorithms. For instance, there are studies on how much improvement can be achieved over passive learning (where all training data is randomly sampled).\n\n3. **Practical Applications**: Active learning has been applied in various domains including natural language processing, computer vision, bioinformatics, and robotics. For example, in image classification tasks, active learning can significantly reduce the number of labeled images needed to achieve a certain level of performance.\n\n4. **Integration with Deep Learning**: Recent work has combined deep learning techniques with active learning strategies. This includes using neural networks to predict uncertainty or importance of unlabeled data points.\n\n5. **Challenges and Limitations**: There are ongoing discussions about challenges such as the potential bias introduced by active learning strategies and the computational complexity involved in querying strategies.\n\n6. **Comparative Studies**: Many studies compare different active learning approaches to passive learning and each other, providing insights into the effectiveness of various methods under different conditions.\n\nTo explore this topic further, you might want to look into journals and conferences that publish machine learning research, such as the Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), Neural Computation, ICML (International Conference on Machine Learning), NeurIPS (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems), and CVPR (Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, specific papers like \"Active Learning Literature Survey\" by Burr Settles provide comprehensive reviews of the field.", "shortest_response": "Yes, there is substantial research on active learning in supervised machine learning settings. Active learning is a special case of semi-supervised learning where the algorithm can interactively query a user (or some other information source) to obtain the desired outputs at new data points. This process is particularly useful when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.\n\nIn the context of supervised learning, active learning aims to reduce the number of training samples needed for model training by selecting the most informative samples for labeling. The core idea is that not all data points are equally valuable for improving a model's performance. By strategically choosing which examples to label next, active learning can achieve better performance with fewer labeled examples compared to random sampling.\n\nSeveral strategies have been proposed for selecting informative examples, including:\n\n1. **Uncertainty Sampling**: This method selects the data points that the current model is most uncertain about. For instance, in classification tasks, this could be the points closest to decision boundaries.\n   \n2. **Query-by-Committee**: Here, multiple models are trained and used as a committee to identify the most contentious cases that the committee members disagree upon.\n   \n3. **Expected Model Change**: This strategy selects examples based on how much their inclusion would change the model parameters, often measured by the expected gradient length.\n   \n4. **Bayesian Active Learning**: This approach uses Bayesian inference to select examples that maximize the expected information gain.\n\nResearch on active learning has been published across various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. Studies often compare different active learning strategies against each other and against passive learning (random sampling), demonstrating the potential benefits of active learning in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nFor more detailed insights, you might want to look into specific papers and reviews from journals such as Machine Learning, Journal of Machine Learning Research, or conferences like NeurIPS, ICML, and CVPR.", "input_size": 42, "output_sizes": [418, 498, 441, 392, 397, 405, 456, 379, 430, 461], "output_mean": 427.7, "output_std": 34.97, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 399.0, "p50": 424.0, "p75": 452.25, "p99": 494.67}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 19.07155}, {"sample_id": "a577324c20e71a60", "prompt_id": "8cb88e4987390bb3", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Rate this prompt on a scale of 1-10.\n\nIf it is below 8, tell me what improvements I should make.\n\nAn futuristic typewriter machine in a work room in the mountains\n\nPlease write in English (US) language.", "longest_response": "I would rate this prompt a 7 out of 10.

They were both exceptionally brilliant, but their brains weren't just for show; they were determined to save the planet from environmental doom. Little did they know, their wedding day would kick off an unexpected adventure that would test their smarts and bring together two very different worlds.\n\n#### **The Wedding Day Mishap**\n\nAs John and Ren\u00e9e exchanged vows under a canopy of blooming cherry blossoms, a mysterious gust of wind swept across the ceremony grounds, snatching away all the baguettes from the reception table. These weren't ordinary baguettes\u2014these were magical, enchanted by a mischievous sprite named Snorri who lived in the nearby forest. Snorri had a penchant for pranks and decided that today was the perfect day to play a trick on the happy couple.\n\n#### **Baguette Quest Begins**\n\nUnbeknownst to them, the baguettes were not just snacks; they held a secret. Each one contained a tiny piece of a powerful ancient artifact known as the \"Solar Scepter,\" which could amplify solar energy and potentially save the planet from an impending solar crisis. The pieces were scattered across the globe, and it was up to John and Ren\u00e9e to find them before it was too late.\n\nRen\u00e9e, with her knowledge of languages, quickly translated a cryptic message left behind by Snorri. It read:\n\n> \"To find the Solar Scepter, you must journey far and wide. Follow the path of the sun, and let your hearts guide you.\"\n\n#### **The Journey Begins**\n\nArmed with their wits and a map, John and Ren\u00e9e embarked on their quest. Their first stop was Paris, France, where Ren\u00e9e's family awaited them. They arrived just in time for a traditional French dinner, but little did they know, their evening would take an adventurous turn.\n\nDuring the meal, Ren\u00e9e noticed a peculiar guest at the table\u2014a man claiming to be a collector of rare artifacts. He mentioned overhearing a conversation about a mysterious object and offered to help them if they could solve a riddle. The riddle went like this:\n\n> \"I am light, yet I am dark. I warm your skin, yet I can burn. In the morning I rise, and at night I set. What am I?\"\n\nJohn, ever the quick thinker, replied, \"The sun.\" The man nodded and handed over a small, golden trinket shaped like a sunburst. Inside, they found another piece of the Solar Scepter.\n\n#### **Norway to the Rescue**\n\nTheir next clue led them back to Norway, where John's expertise in medicine came into play. They discovered that a local scientist had been experimenting with solar energy but had made a critical error. The scientist, Dr. Bj\u00f8rn, had accidentally created a device that was draining solar energy from the atmosphere, causing severe weather anomalies.\n\nJohn and Ren\u00e9e worked together to fix the device, combining John\u2019s medical knowledge with Ren\u00e9e\u2019s understanding of solar energy. They managed to recalibrate the machine, restoring balance to the atmosphere. As a token of gratitude, Dr. Bj\u00f8rn revealed another piece of the Solar Scepter hidden within his lab.\n\n#### **Global Adventure**\n\nWith each piece of the Solar Scepter collected, John and Ren\u00e9e's reputation grew. They traveled to Japan, India, Brazil, and beyond, facing challenges that tested their intelligence and teamwork. In each country, they met new friends and allies who helped them solve puzzles and overcome obstacles.\n\nIn Japan, they teamed up with a group of monks who taught them the art of meditation, helping them stay focused and calm during their perilous journey. In India, they joined a festival celebrating the sun god, where they learned ancient chants that guided them to the next piece of the Scepter.\n\n#### **The Final Piece**\n\nFinally, they reached the final destination: the Amazon rainforest. Here, they encountered the last piece of the Solar Scepter, guarded by Snorri himself. After a series of playful challenges, including a race through the jungle, they managed to retrieve the final piece.\n\n#### **Reuniting the Scepter**\n\nBack in Norway, John and Ren\u00e9e reunited the pieces of the Solar Scepter. With a flick of the wrist, the scepter glowed brightly, amplifying solar energy and stabilizing the planet's climate. The sun shone brighter than ever before, and the world rejoiced.\n\n#### **Happily Ever After**\n\nAfter their grand adventure, John and Ren\u00e9e returned to their wedding celebration, now heroes of the planet. They shared their story with everyone, and the guests cheered for the Baguette Brigade. As they cut the cake, John proposed a toast to their future, saying, \"To us, to our love, and to saving the planet\u2014one baguette at a time!\"\n\nAnd so, the newlyweds continued their journey, using their combined talents to protect the Earth and ensure a bright future for generations to come.", "shortest_response": "Once upon a time, in a quaint village nestled between Norway's fjords and France's rolling hills, John, a super doctor from Norway, was about to marry Ren\u00e9e, a French linguist, athlete, and PhD candidate studying solar energy.

But fate had other plans. On the morning of the big day, while John was perfecting his toast with a baguette and honey (his favorite pre-wedding breakfast), Ren\u00e9e received an urgent message from her tree friends. It seemed the planet was in trouble. A massive solar eclipse was about to block out the sun, threatening to plunge Earth into eternal darkness.\n\nRen\u00e9e knew she had to act fast. She grabbed her laptop, packed a bag with her favorite running shoes, a solar-powered charger, and a few baguettes for sustenance, and rushed to find John. \"We have to go!\" she exclaimed, waving her phone in front of him.\n\n\"Go where?\" John asked, confused but ready for any adventure.\n\n\"To the moon!\" Ren\u00e9e replied, grinning widely. \"We need to fix the orbit of the moon to prevent the eclipse.\"\n\nJohn, being a super doctor, didn't question her. He just nodded and grabbed his own bag, which contained a stethoscope, a solar-powered defibrillator, and, of course, a baguette. They hopped onto a spaceship John had secretly built in his garage and blasted off towards the moon.\n\nUpon landing, they found a group of astronauts who were equally perplexed but willing to help. With Ren\u00e9e's knowledge of solar energy and John's medical expertise (which surprisingly came in handy for space-related emergencies), they worked together to recalibrate the moon's orbit using a combination of solar flares and gravitational waves.\n\nMeanwhile, back on Earth, people were starting to panic. The sky darkened, and temperatures dropped. But then, just as the eclipse was about to reach its peak, a bright light shone from the moon. It was John and Ren\u00e9e, successfully adjusting the moon's path with a final push from a giant, solar-powered baguette launcher that John had invented on the spot.\n\nThe eclipse passed without incident, and the sun shone brightly once more. Back on the moon, John and Ren\u00e9e shared a triumphant baguette, celebrating their success. As they looked down at Earth, they saw the world celebrating too\u2014cities lit up, fireworks exploded, and yes, even a few baguette-shaped balloons floated across the sky.\n\nThey returned home to a hero's welcome. Their wedding went off without a hitch, with the guests enjoying baguettes and recounting the tale of how Dr. John and Mother Nature saved the planet with science, athleticism, and a whole lot of bread power.\n\nAnd so, John and Ren\u00e9e lived happily ever after, continuing to save the world one adventure at a time, always making sure to pack plenty of baguettes for fuel.", "input_size": 121, "output_sizes": [760, 760, 713, 813, 1075, 728, 755, 711, 851, 667], "output_mean": 783.3, "output_std": 109.18, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 716.75, "p50": 757.5, "p75": 799.75, "p99": 1054.84}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 49.84576}, {"sample_id": "4b80e4ce457d4e8f", "prompt_id": "2d76e41615e1de15", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "There are certain ad copy best practices that should be taken into account when writing your ads.

Here\u2019s a general guide to help you through the process:\n\n### 1. Determine the Value of the Item\nThe value of the item is crucial as it affects the duties and taxes you might have to pay. This includes the cost of the product itself plus any shipping costs.\n\n### 2. Understand Duty Rates\nDuty rates vary based on the type of goods being shipped. The Harmonized System (HS) code is used internationally to classify products and determine duty rates. You can find this information on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) website or other relevant customs authorities\u2019 websites.\n\n### 3. Check if the Item Qualifies for Duty-Free Status\nSome items may qualify for duty-free status under certain conditions. For example, personal items sent to oneself may be exempt from duties up to a certain limit. However, these limits can change based on the specific item and its value.\n\n### 4. Consider VAT (Value Added Tax)\nIn France, VAT is typically included in the price of goods. When goods are imported into the USA, VAT paid in France is not refunded but is not usually added again as a separate tax. However, you should be aware that state sales taxes might apply in the USA.\n\n### 5. Calculate Estimated Duties and Taxes\nUse online calculators provided by shipping companies like DHL, FedEx, or UPS. These tools can give you an estimate based on the value of your shipment, the HS code of the item, and other factors.\n\n### 6. Factor in Additional Costs\nBesides duties and taxes, there might be additional costs such as handling fees, brokerage fees, and other administrative charges.\n\n### 7. Consult with a Professional\nFor complex shipments or high-value items, consulting with a customs broker or a professional freight forwarder can provide more accurate guidance and ensure compliance with all regulations.\n\n### Example Calculation:\nLet's say you're sending a product worth \u20ac200 from France to the USA, and the applicable duty rate is 5%.\n\n- **Convert the value to USD**: If the current exchange rate is 1\u20ac = 1.10 USD, then the value in USD would be approximately $220.\n- **Calculate the duty**: At a 5% duty rate, the duty would be $220 * 0.05 = $11.\n- **Add any applicable taxes**: State sales tax varies by location; for simplicity, let's assume a flat 8% sales tax. The sales tax would be $220 * 0.08 = $17.60.\n\nSo, the total estimated customs fees would be the sum of the duty and the sales tax: $11 + $17.60 = $28.60.\n\n### Final Note:\nCustoms regulations and rates can change, so always check the most recent information from official sources before finalizing your shipment.", "shortest_response": "Estimating customs fees for a product delivery from France to the USA involves several steps and considerations. Here\u2019s a general guide to help you through the process:\n\n1. **Determine the Value of the Goods**: The declared value of your goods is crucial as it affects the duties and taxes you might have to pay. This includes the price paid for the item(s), plus shipping costs and insurance.\n\n2. **Identify the Harmonized System (HS) Code**: Each type of good has an HS code which is used internationally to classify products for import/export purposes. This code helps in determining the applicable tariffs and taxes.\n\n3. **Research Tariffs and Taxes**: Visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) website or use their Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) system to find out the specific duties and taxes applicable to your goods based on their HS code and declared value. There are also online tools and services that can provide this information.\n\n4. **Consider Additional Fees**: Besides duties and taxes, there may be other charges such as brokerage fees if you use a customs broker, handling fees by the carrier, and possibly VAT (Value Added Tax) if applicable.\n\n5. **Check for Exemptions or Quotas**: Some items may qualify for exemptions or fall under special trade agreements like NAFTA (though note that NAFTA has been replaced by USMCA). Additionally, there might be specific quotas for certain goods that could affect the cost.\n\n6. **Use Online Calculators**: Many carriers and customs brokers offer online calculators that can give you a rough estimate of the customs fees based on the declared value and type of goods.\n\n7. **Consult with a Customs Broker or Professional**: If you're unsure about any part of the process or dealing with high-value items, consulting with a professional customs broker can be beneficial. They can provide detailed advice tailored to your situation.\n\n8. **Declare Correctly**: Ensure that all documents accompanying your shipment are accurate and complete. Misdeclaration can lead to delays and additional fees.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to get a reasonable estimate of the customs fees for your delivery from France to the USA.

Imagine that you are a software developer with a lot of projects on GitHub. You want to add a button to your react native iOS app that opens up the camera. Write the code for it:", "longest_response": "Certainly! To add a button in a React Native application that opens the device's camera, you'll need to use the `react-native-camera` package or the newer `expo-camera` if you're using Expo. Since you mentioned a native iOS app without specifying Expo, I'll guide you through setting up the camera functionality using the `react-native-camera` package.\n\n### Step 1: Install the `react-native-camera` package\n\nFirst, you need to install the `react-native-camera` package. Open your terminal and run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install react-native-camera\n# or\nyarn add react-native-camera\n```\n\nFor iOS, you also need to link the library:\n\n```bash\ncd ios && pod install && cd ..\n```\n\n### Step 2: Add Camera Permissions\n\nBefore you can access the camera, you need to add the necessary permissions to your `Info.plist` file:\n\n1. Open your Xcode project.\n2. Go to `Runner/Info.plist`.\n3. Add the following keys:\n   - `Privacy - Camera Usage Description`\n   - `Privacy - Microphone Usage Description`\n\nExample values might be:\n\n```xml\n<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>\n<string>We need access to your camera to take pictures.</string>\n<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>\n<string>We need access to your microphone to record videos.</string>\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create a Component with a Button to Open the Camera\n\nNow, let's create a simple component that includes a button which, when pressed, will open the camera.\n\nHere's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport { Button, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { RNCamera } from 'react-native-camera';\n\nconst App = () => {\n    const [showCamera, setShowCamera] = useState(false);\n\n    const handleOpenCamera = () => {\n        setShowCamera(true);\n    };\n\n    const handleCloseCamera = () => {\n        setShowCamera(false);\n    };\n\n    return (\n        <View style={styles.container}>\n            {!showCamera ? (\n                <Button title=\"Open Camera\" onPress={handleOpenCamera} />\n            ) : (\n                <RNCamera\n                    style={styles.preview}\n                    type={RNCamera.Constants.Type.back}\n                    flashMode={RNCamera.Constants.FlashMode.off}\n                    androidCameraPermissionOptions={{\n                        title: 'Permission to use camera',\n                        message: 'We need your permission to use your camera',\n                        buttonPositive: 'Ok',\n                        buttonNegative: 'Cancel',\n                    }}\n                    androidRecordAudioPermissionOptions={{\n                        title: 'Permission to use audio recording',\n                        message: 'We need your permission to use your audio',\n                        buttonPositive: 'Ok',\n                        buttonNegative: 'Cancel',\n                    }}\n                >\n                    <View style={{ flex: 0, flexDirection: 'row', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n                        <Button title=\"Close Camera\" onPress={handleCloseCamera} />\n                    </View>\n                </RNCamera>\n            )}\n        </View>\n    );\n};\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n    container: {\n        flex: 1,\n        justifyContent: 'center',\n        alignItems: 'center',\n    },\n    preview: {\n        flex: 1,\n        justifyContent: 'flex-end',\n        alignItems: 'center',\n    },\n});\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nThis code snippet creates a basic React Native app with a button. When the button is pressed, the camera opens up, and there's another button within the camera view to close it.\n\n### Notes:\n- This example uses the `RNCamera` component directly. If you want to capture photos or videos, you would typically use methods like `takePictureAsync()` or `startRecordingAsync()`, respectively.\n- Ensure that you handle errors and edge cases appropriately in production code, such as checking if the user has granted the necessary permissions.\n- The styling is minimal for simplicity; you may want to adjust it according to your design needs.\n\nThat should get you started with adding a camera feature to your React Native iOS app!", "shortest_response": "Sure! To add a button in a React Native application that opens the device's camera, you'll need to use the `react-native-camera` package (now known as `react-native-camera-kit` or `react-native-vision-camera` due to licensing issues with the original `react-native-camera`). For this example, I'll use `react-native-vision-camera`, which is actively maintained and works well.\n\nFirst, you need to install the necessary packages:\n\n```bash\nnpm install react-native-vision-camera @vision/react-native-vision-camera\n# or if using yarn\nyarn add react-native-vision-camera @vision/react-native-vision-camera\n```\n\nAfter installing the package, you also need to link it to your project:\n\nFor `react-native >= 0.60`, the package should automatically link itself. If not, you might need to manually link it or use `pod install` for iOS.\n\nNow, let's create a simple component that includes a button to open the camera:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useRef } from 'react';\nimport { Button, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { Camera } from 'react-native-vision-camera';\n\nconst App = () => {\n    const camera = useRef(null);\n\n    const takePicture = async () => {\n        if (!(await Camera.isCameraPermissionGranted())) {\n            await Camera.requestCameraPermission();\n        }\n        if (camera.current) {\n            const photo = await camera.current.takePhoto({\n                quality: 1,\n                // You can add more options here like flashMode etc.\n            });\n            console.log(photo.path); // Do something with the photo path\n        }\n    };\n\n    return (\n        <View style={styles.container}>\n            <Button title=\"Open Camera\" onPress={() => takePicture()} />\n            {camera.current && <Camera ref={camera} style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill} />}\n        </View>\n    );\n};\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n    container: {\n        flex: 1,\n        justifyContent: 'center',\n        alignItems: 'center',\n    },\n});\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nThis code sets up a basic React Native app with a button that, when pressed, requests permission to access the camera and then takes a picture. The camera view will be shown once the button is pressed and the permission is granted.\n\nNote:\n- This example assumes you want to take a picture when the button is pressed. If you want to keep the camera always open while allowing users to take pictures, you would need to adjust the logic accordingly.\n- Make sure to handle permissions properly according to Apple's guidelines and the requirements of `react-native-vision-camera`.\n\nBefore running the app, ensure you've configured your Xcode project for camera usage by adding the necessary keys to your `Info.plist` file (like `NSCameraUsageDescription`).\n\nRemember to test this code on an actual device or an iOS simulator as the camera functionality won't work in the browser or Android emulators.", "input_size": 73, "output_sizes": [642, 718, 635, 791, 835, 605, 737, 779, 648, 847], "output_mean": 723.7, "output_std": 83.52, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 643.5, "p50": 727.5, "p75": 788.0, "p99": 845.92}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 36.27771}, {"sample_id": "0faca20ddea0b1e0", "prompt_id": "6e9c7ced9b79284b", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Another:\n\n197 Patient: They\u2019re comfortable about who they are, so they can let me be who I am.

I have this confidence, I have a knowing, that they\u2019ll watch me, in a way they trust, that they don\u2019t need to contain me, that they\u2019ll give me the space to move forward.\n\nAnother:\n\nPatient: They\u2019re interested in the people I\u2019m interested in. They don\u2019t feel that people are threats to them. They want to support my own connections. They know how important that is.\n\nTherapist: They know how important that is. What effect does that have on your inner state? Patient: It makes me feel I can venture farther. I\u2019m not stealing myself from them. They think it\u2019s a healthy thing I want to go away. They\u2019re happy I can go away, and come back, and I\u2019m my own person.\n\nAnother:\n\nPatient: I can look around more. I\u2019m walking. I can go to places I didn\u2019t want to go to before, to new places. I don\u2019t have to worry about things.\n\nAnother:\n\nPatient: It\u2019s on the street, in a neighborhood where we live. I suggest walking together down the street. And we do. (Pause) And now I\u2019m walking ahead, and I know they\u2019re there behind me, even though I can\u2019t see them. There\u2019s just a weird sense of the neighborhood expanding; no, not the neighborhood expanding, but the comfort expanding, into the world.\n\nIn the expression below, a patient highlights what he experiences as a very significant change in his experience of relationship with his ideal parent figures. This change is clearly the emergence of an internalized secure base:\n\nIt feels like a meeting has taken place among the three of us . . . it feels very different than before . . . it feels like a starting point, like I can start to do things, and they can start to guide me and help me in ways that are right. It feels like the connection has become fully established, rather than becoming established. Up until now it felt like I was trying to feel connection with them . . . now it feels like that\u2019s been established. Now it\u2019s about me being more active, because I have the trust and connection with them now . . . I can do things and return to them . . . for interpretation of what it is I\u2019m doing . . . It\u2019s like a whole new approach to being in a way . . . fundamentally they\u2019re interested in me. I guess I can start to be me, with their guidance . . . they can help me with that . . . they can be supportive in ways I\u2019ve never experienced before.\n\nReinforcing the Internalized Secure Base\n\nWhen signs of a secure base are apparent in the patient\u2019s imagery, the therapist helps to extend, strengthen, and deepen that state by continuing to apply the principles of enhancing desired experiences. These include (1) mirroring, (2) bringing attention to felt experience, (3) amplifying positive states, (4) anchoring positive states in body experience, and (5) suggesting new scenes in which the desired state is also present. All of these appear in the example below:\n\n198 Patient: We\u2019re on a beach, a rocky beach. I can go and get rocks, and come back and give them to them, and they receive them. They pay attention to them, to the details, so we can look at things together.\n\nTherapist: Yes, you can go and get rocks, and then come back to them. Notice what it\u2019s like as you go off by yourself, really feeling that they\u2019re there for you. You can feel that secure feeling, can\u2019t you? Patient: Yes.\n\nTherapist: You can really tune in to that secure feeling now. Feel what that\u2019s like, as you experience the secure feeling right now. What\u2019s the secure feeling like?\n\nPatient: Well, I feel like I can be myself, and do what I want. And even if I\u2019m not with my parents, I know that they\u2019re there for me, if I need them.\n\nTherapist: Yes, you can be yourself. And they\u2019re there for you, when and if you need them. . . . And now this scene fades away, and a new scene is about to appear. In this new scene, you\u2019re also with these parents, and you\u2019re feeling the secure feeling even more strongly. In this new scene, you\u2019re feeling the secure feeling so clearly, and you can be yourself, and do what you want, and you know deep down that these parents are there for you if you need them. As this new scene appears, you can say what\u2019s happening and what it\u2019s like for you.\n\nPatient: Well, we\u2019re at a playground, and I\u2019m playing with other kids. I know my parents are there, but they\u2019re letting me do what I want, playing, and I don\u2019t see them, but I know if I looked for them they\u2019d be there.\n\nTherapist: Yes. You can feel that they\u2019re there for you, while you\u2019re playing and enjoying yourself. Notice what you feel inside now.\n\nPatient: I feel happy. And there\u2019s like a confidence too.\n\nTherapist: You feel happy, and a confidence too. Really feel that happy feeling, and that confidence. And as you feel that, notice how you feel that in your body. What\u2019s it like to feel so happy, and confident, in your body?\n\nPatient: Well, there\u2019s an energy, a good-feeling energy. Like I can be me, and play. I\u2019m safe there. Therapist: Yes, you can be you, with that good-feeling energy, and you\u2019re safe. Feel that even more clearly in your body now. Even more in your body.\n\nYou can really feel it. Become even more familiar with this feeling, and what it\u2019s like as you experience it in your body. And the more you do that the more familiar you\u2019ll become with this goodfeeling energy, being you, being safe. And the more familiar you are with this, the more continuously you\u2019ll be able to feel it and hold it in your awareness. . . . You can really feel it now, can\u2019t you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nTherapist: This safety, this safety. Really feel it, feel it in your body and through your whole being.\n\nWhen a patient is deeply immersed in the imagery, the sense of time can be expanded so that positive states can be experienced as having a longer duration than actual clock time. Time expansion (and contraction) is a common hypnotic technique and is very beneficial for supporting the development of familiarity and mastery of desired qualities. In the interaction with the above patient, the therapist introduced time expansion to reinforce the patient\u2019s experience of safety as follows:\n\nTherapist: And now, even though only a few moments of clock time will pass, it will seem like much longer time elapses, long enough for you to experience this safety in a way that makes it so very familiar to you. You have all the time it takes for this safety to become part of you, to experience it more and more as a foundation of who you are.\n\nWorking With Present Experience and Reducing the Frequency of IPF Sessions\n\nAs indications of internalized secure base appear more consistently and vividly in a patient\u2019s IPF experience, he or she will more and more frequently report signs of greater security in his or her current, day-to-day, between-sessions life. For example, a patient might say, \u201cI find myself sometimes actually enjoying when she touches me\u201d or \u201cWhen he said he was mad at me, I wasn\u2019t as worried that he\u2019d leave me\u201d or \u201cFinally I called a piano teacher and scheduled a first lesson.\u201d In response to these current life manifestations of security, the therapist delights in these new experiences and applies the same reinforcing methods that are used to support positive experiences in the IPF imagery: mirroring and amplifying the positive states and how they are experienced in the body. The IPF method of suggesting new scenes in which desired experiences are also present is modified to make it relevant to the patient\u2019s current life experience. After reinforcing the patient\u2019s", "longest_response": "current experience of security and support in daily life, the therapist might facilitate a conversation that encourages the patient to envision similar scenarios occurring in their real-life situations. Here's an example of how this could unfold:\n\n**Therapist:** That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're experiencing a lot more security and comfort in your everyday interactions. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you're enjoying physical touch or when you're less worried about someone's anger?\n\n**Patient:** When she touches me, it feels warm and comforting. Before, I would tense up, but now, I can relax and enjoy it. And when he got mad at me, instead of panicking, I felt like I could handle it. It's like I have a buffer now.\n\n**Therapist:** That's a great description. It seems like you're developing a stronger sense of security in those moments. Let's explore this further. Imagine you're in a situation where you're about to call another teacher for lessons, just like you did with the piano teacher. How do you feel as you're making that call?\n\n**Patient:** I feel a bit nervous, but I also feel hopeful and confident that I can do it. It's like I'm not as scared anymore.\n\n**Therapist:** It sounds like you're already experiencing a blend of emotions\u2014nervousness, but also hope and confidence. Can you imagine yourself taking that step and calling the teacher? What does that feel like in your body?\n\n**Patient:** My hands might shake a little, but I can feel my heart beating steadily. I can breathe easier now, and there's a sense of determination.\n\n**Therapist:** It's fantastic to see how you're connecting with those feelings of confidence and determination. Each time you take a step like this, you're building on the foundation of security you've developed. What do you think would happen if you were to call that teacher today?\n\n**Patient:** I think I would probably feel relieved afterward. And maybe a little proud of myself for taking that step.\n\n**Therapist:** That's a great insight! Feeling proud of yourself for taking steps towards what you want is a powerful experience. As you continue to build on these positive experiences, you'll likely find that these feelings of security and confidence become even more natural in your day-to-day life.\n\nBy reinforcing the patient's positive experiences and encouraging them to visualize and enact similar scenarios in real life, the therapist helps to integrate the internalized secure base into the patient's broader life context. This process not only strengthens the patient's sense of security but also enhances their ability to navigate and engage with the world more confidently and comfortably.", "shortest_response": "current positive experiences, the therapist may encourage the patient to continue applying these new insights and feelings of security in real-life situations. This process helps solidify the internalized secure base and ensures that the benefits gained from IPF sessions are transferred into everyday life, making the patient's overall well-being more robust and sustainable.\n\nThe therapist's role here is pivotal in helping the patient integrate these new experiences and perceptions into their daily interactions and relationships. By acknowledging and reinforcing the patient's progress, the therapist encourages the patient to trust their own growing sense of security and self-worth. This empowerment is crucial for long-term therapeutic success, as it equips the patient with the tools and confidence needed to navigate challenges independently, reducing reliance on the therapist over time.\n\nFurthermore, as the patient reports more frequent instances of security and stability in their current life, the frequency of IPF sessions can be gradually reduced. This reduction should be done carefully, ensuring that the patient maintains the gains made and continues to feel supported. The therapist may also introduce homework assignments or exercises that the patient can practice between sessions to further consolidate their newfound sense of security and self-efficacy.\n\nOverall, the goal is to transition the patient from needing intensive therapeutic intervention to relying on their internalized secure base for navigating life's complexities, fostering a resilient and self-assured individual capable of thriving in various contexts.", "input_size": 1876, "output_sizes": [439, 371, 325, 413, 414, 273, 320, 362, 400, 548], "output_mean": 386.5, "output_std": 72.39, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 334.25, "p50": 385.5, "p75": 413.75, "p99": 538.19}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 44.25173}, {"sample_id": "194aaf91360a3683", "prompt_id": "0de4759258cbdfa1", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "We are an established bicycle company and now starting a new business selling 3D printed carbon fiber bicycles in the USA region, with a focus on speed, adventure and\nsports models.

Explain the first normal form (1NF) with an example.", "longest_response": "Normalization in database design is a systematic approach to decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves organizing columns (attributes) and tables (relations) in a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency. The process of normalization typically results in dividing large tables into smaller ones and specifying relationships between them.\n\nThe first normal form (1NF) is the foundational step in the normalization process. A table is said to be in 1NF if it meets the following criteria:\n\n- Each column contains atomic (indivisible) values, meaning that each cell contains only single values and not multiple values.\n- There are no repeating groups of data; each row must be unique and identifiable.\n\n### Example of First Normal Form\n\nConsider a simple database for a library that tracks books and their authors. Initially, you might have a table structured as follows:\n\n| BookID | Title           | Authors                  |\n|--------|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| 001    | \"The Great Gatsby\"| F. Scott Fitzgerald     |\n| 002    | \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" | Harper Lee            |\n| 003    | \"1984\"          | George Orwell            |\n| 004    | \"Animal Farm\"   | George Orwell, Animal Farm Editor |\n\nIn this initial structure, the \"Authors\" column violates the first normal form because it contains multiple values (for example, \"George Orwell, Animal Farm Editor\") in a single cell, which means it doesn't contain atomic values.\n\nTo normalize this table to 1NF, we need to ensure that each cell contains a single value. This can be achieved by splitting the data so that there is one author per row for each book. Here's how the table would look after normalization:\n\n**Books Table:**\n| BookID | Title               |\n|--------|---------------------|\n| 001    | \"The Great Gatsby\"  |\n| 002    | \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" |\n| 003    | \"1984\"              |\n| 004    | \"Animal Farm\"       |\n\n**Authors Table:**\n| AuthorID | AuthorName         |\n|----------|--------------------|\n| 001      | F. Scott Fitzgerald|\n| 002      | Harper Lee         |\n| 003      | George Orwell      |\n| 004      | Animal Farm Editor |\n\n**Book_Authors Table:**\n| BookID | AuthorID |\n|--------|----------|\n| 001    | 001      |\n| 002    | 002      |\n| 003    | 003      |\n| 004    | 003      |\n| 004    | 004      |\n\nIn this normalized version, each table adheres to the rules of 1NF:\n- The \"Books\" table lists each book uniquely with its title.\n- The \"Authors\" table lists each author uniquely.\n- The \"Book_Authors\" table connects books and authors, ensuring that each combination of book and author is represented in a separate row, thus eliminating any repetition or non-atomic values.\n\nThis structure ensures that every piece of data is stored in a single, indivisible unit, making the database more consistent and easier to manage.", "shortest_response": "Normalization in database design is a systematic approach to organizing data into tables and minimizing redundancy and anomaly issues. It helps in creating a more efficient, less redundant database structure that is easier to maintain and update.\n\nThe first step in normalization is achieving First Normal Form (1NF). The primary goals of 1NF are to eliminate repeating groups and ensure atomicity of data elements within a table. In other words, 1NF requires that each column in a table contains atomic values, meaning that each value in a column should be indivisible and unique.\n\n### Example of First Normal Form (1NF)\n\nLet's consider a simple scenario where we want to track information about books in a library. We might start with a table that looks like this:\n\n| BookID | Title       | Authors                |\n|--------|-------------|------------------------|\n| 001    | \"The Great\" | \"AuthorA\", \"AuthorB\"   |\n\nThis table is not in 1NF because the \"Authors\" column contains a list of authors, which means it is not atomic; it can be broken down further.\n\nTo achieve 1NF, we would break this down so that each column contains only atomic values. This could result in two separate tables: one for books and another for book-author relationships:\n\n**Books Table:**\n\n| BookID | Title       |\n|--------|-------------|\n| 001    | \"The Great\" |\n\n**Book_Authors Table:**\n\n| BookID | AuthorName |\n|--------|------------|\n| 001    | AuthorA    |\n| 001    | AuthorB    |\n\nIn this revised setup, both tables adhere to 1NF because every column in each table contains atomic values. Each row in the \"Book_Authors\" table represents a single relationship between a book and an author, ensuring that no column contains a set or list of values.\n\nBy adhering to 1NF, we have made our data structure simpler and more consistent, which makes it easier to manage and query effectively.", "input_size": 52, "output_sizes": [531, 485, 620, 417, 483, 699, 573, 583, 546, 635], "output_mean": 557.2, "output_std": 78.87, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 496.5, "p50": 559.5, "p75": 610.75, "p99": 693.24}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 28.49727}, {"sample_id": "0e876c057dd9b9ff", "prompt_id": "d71bfa858fd3ec2f", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "if 60tb is usd 9135.45, how much is 1gb?", "longest_response": "To find out the price per gigabyte (GB) when 60 terabytes (TB) costs USD 9,135.45, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.

He can also use his time to enhance the outdoor spaces, making them more attractive for guests.\n\n2. **Fishing Activities:** If guests are interested, he could organize fishing trips or provide information about local fishing spots. This could be a unique selling point for your B&B, attracting nature lovers and anglers.\n\n3. **Cooking and Hospitality:** The wife's culinary skills can turn your B&B into a gastronomic haven. She can prepare delicious meals for guests, which can include breakfasts, dinners, or even afternoon tea. Her attention to detail in the kitchen can ensure that all food served is fresh and appetizing.\n\n4. **Laundry Services:** Efficient laundry services are crucial for keeping linens clean and fresh for each new guest. Ensuring that all bedding and towels are laundered promptly and effectively can contribute significantly to guest satisfaction.\n\n5. **Combined Efforts:** Consider combining their skills to create special experiences for guests. For example, a fishing trip followed by a home-cooked meal using fish caught during the excursion could be a memorable experience.\n\n6. **Marketing and Promotion:** Both partners can share their expertise through social media and other marketing channels. Pictures of beautiful fishing spots and delicious meals can attract visitors looking for a unique experience.\n\nBy leveraging each partner's strengths, you can create a warm, inviting, and well-maintained environment that caters to various interests and needs of your guests.", "shortest_response": "That sounds like a well-rounded team!

They are all perfect logicians -- if a conclusion can be logically deduced, they will do it instantly. No one knows the color of their eyes. Every night at midnight, a ferry stops at the island. Any islanders who have figured out the color of their own eyes then leave the island, and the rest stay. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a count of the number of people they see with each eye color (excluding themselves), but they cannot otherwise communicate. Everyone on the island knows all the rules in this paragraph.\n\nOn this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people, and the Guru (she happens to have green eyes). So any given blue-eyed person can see 100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes (and one with green), but that does not tell him his own eye color; as far as he knows the totals could be 101 brown and 99 blue. Or 100 brown, 99 blue, and he could have red eyes.\n\nThe Guru is allowed to speak once (let's say at noon), on one day in all their endless years on the island. Standing before the islanders, she says the following:\n\n\"I can see someone who has blue eyes.\"\n\nWho leaves the island, and on what night?\nThere are no mirrors or reflecting surfaces, nothing dumb. It is not a trick question, and the answer is logical. It doesn't depend on tricky wording or anyone lying or guessing, and it doesn't involve people doing something silly like creating a sign language or doing genetics. The Guru is not making eye contact with anyone in particular; she's simply saying \"I count at least one blue-eyed person on this island who isn't me.\"\n\nAnd lastly, the answer is not \"no one leaves.\"", "longest_response": "To solve this puzzle, we need to delve into the logic of induction and the implications of the Guru's statement. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n### Base Case: One Blue-Eyed Person\n- If there were only one blue-eyed person on the island, that person would see no other blue-eyed individuals.\n- When the Guru announces that she sees someone with blue eyes, this person realizes that the only possible blue-eyed individual is himself.\n- Therefore, he would leave on the first night after the Guru's announcement.\n\n### Inductive Step: Two Blue-Eyed People\n- Suppose there are two blue-eyed people. Each sees one other person with blue eyes.\n- Each of these individuals thinks: \"If I do not have blue eyes, the other blue-eyed person will see no one with blue eyes and will leave on the first night.\"\n- Since no one leaves on the first night, both realize that there must be another blue-eyed person besides themselves.\n- Hence, both will conclude that they also have blue eyes and will leave on the second night.\n\n### Generalization: N Blue-Eyed People\n- Now consider the case with \\(N\\) blue-eyed people. Each blue-eyed person sees \\(N-1\\) others with blue eyes.\n- Each thinks: \"If I do not have blue eyes, the \\(N-1\\) blue-eyed people will think there are \\(N-2\\) blue-eyed people.\"\n- By the inductive hypothesis, if there are \\(N-1\\) blue-eyed people, they would all leave on the \\((N-1)\\)-th night.\n- Since no one leaves on the \\((N-1)\\)-th night, each blue-eyed person concludes that there must be \\(N\\) blue-eyed people, including themselves.\n- Thus, all \\(N\\) blue-eyed people will leave on the \\(N\\)-th night.\n\n### Application to the Given Scenario\n- There are 100 blue-eyed people on the island.\n- Each blue-eyed person sees 99 other blue-eyed people.\n- Using the inductive reasoning above, each blue-eyed person will reason that if they do not have blue eyes, the 99 others would leave on the 99th night.\n- Since no one leaves on the 99th night, each of the 100 blue-eyed people concludes that they must have blue eyes.\n- Therefore, all 100 blue-eyed people will leave on the 100th night.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **100 blue-eyed people** will leave the island on the **100th night** after the Guru makes her announcement.\n\nThis solution hinges on the logical deduction process where each person waits for the others to act based on their observations and the passage of time, leading to a collective realization of their own eye color.", "shortest_response": "To solve this puzzle, we need to think through the logic from the perspective of the islanders, especially considering how each person reasons about the eye colors based on the information provided by the Guru.\n\nLet's start with a smaller case to understand the pattern:\n\n### Case with 1 Blue-Eyed Person:\nIf there was only 1 blue-eyed person on the island, upon hearing the Guru's statement (\"I can see someone who has blue eyes\"), that person would immediately know that they must be the one with blue eyes because they see no other blue-eyed people. Therefore, this single blue-eyed person would leave on the first night.\n\n### Case with 2 Blue-Eyed People:\nNow consider the scenario with 2 blue-eyed people. Each of these individuals sees another person with blue eyes. If the Guru's statement were true for just one person, both would expect that person to leave on the first night. When neither leaves, each of them realizes that the other also saw someone with blue eyes, which means they must also have blue eyes. Both would conclude this on the second night and leave together.\n\n### Generalizing to 100 Blue-Eyed People:\nNow extend this reasoning to 100 blue-eyed people. Each blue-eyed person sees 99 others with blue eyes. On the first night, none of them leaves because each expects the others to leave if they were the only ones with blue eyes. Since no one leaves, each blue-eyed person realizes that the others also see many more blue-eyed people, including themselves.\n\nThis process continues recursively. If 99 blue-eyed people did not leave after the first night, each of the 100 blue-eyed people understands that there must be at least 100 blue-eyed people on the island (including themselves). This realization comes on the 100th night, when all 100 blue-eyed people will simultaneously deduce their eye color and leave the island together.\n\nThus, **100 blue-eyed people will leave the island on the 100th night** after the Guru's announcement.", "input_size": 429, "output_sizes": [556, 538, 517, 514, 563, 543, 438, 581, 520, 428], "output_mean": 519.8, "output_std": 47.91, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 514.75, "p50": 529.0, "p75": 552.75, "p99": 579.38}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 28.00529}, {"sample_id": "5079ec9300fd4133", "prompt_id": "63b6a2bf8cd177ad", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Today I am looking at scenes in Midjourney.

To get only unique top three values, you might need a more intricate formula:\n\n```excel\n=UNIQUE(SORT(A:A, -1, 1))[1]:[3]\n```\n\nBut note that this will only work in Excel 365 where `SORT` and `UNIQUE` functions support dynamic arrays.\n\n### Method 3: Using Traditional Array Formula (for older versions of Excel)\n\nFor older versions of Excel, you can use an array formula to get the unique top three values:\n\n1. In cell B1, enter the following array formula and press `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` instead of just Enter to create an array formula:\n\n   ```excel\n   =LARGE(IF(FREQUENCY(A:A, A:A)>0, A:A), ROW(1:1))\n   ```\n\n2.

However, directly setting a solid background color is not natively supported in Adaptive Cards due to their design philosophy of focusing on content rather than decoration. But there are some workarounds:\n\n### Using backgroundImage:\nYou can set a solid-color image as the background.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"AdaptiveCard\",\n  \"version\": \"1.5\",\n  \"backgroundImage\": \"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAACklEQVR4nGMAAQAABQABDQottAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\", // This is a 1x1 transparent pixel with a white background.\n  \"$schema\": \"http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json\",\n  \"body\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"TextBlock\",\n      \"text\": \"This is a card with a custom background color\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, replace `\"iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAACklEQVR4nGMAAQAABQABDQottAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\"` with a data URI for a solid-colored image.\n\n### Using TextBlock with Background Color:\nAnother workaround is to use a TextBlock with a large text size and background color applied, but this is not ideal for setting a background for the entire card.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"AdaptiveCard\",\n  \"version\": \"1.5\",\n  \"body\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"ColumnSet\",\n      \"columns\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Column\",\n          \"width\": \"stretch\",\n          \"items\": [\n            {\n              \"type\": \"TextBlock\",\n              \"text\": \"\",\n              \"size\": \"ExtraLarge\",\n              \"weight\": \"Bolder\",\n              \"color\": \"Dark\",\n              \"wrap\": true,\n              \"backgroundColor\": \"#FFCDD2\" // Your desired background color here\n            }\n          ],\n          \"style\": \"emphasis\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"TextBlock\",\n      \"text\": \"Your content here\",\n      \"wrap\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"$schema\": \"http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `TextBlock` is used to fill the space with a colored background. Note that this method might not cover the entire card area effectively.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most reliable way to set a background color is using `backgroundImage` with a solid-color image. If you need more complex styling, consider using a different UI framework that supports such features natively.", "shortest_response": "To change the background color of an Adaptive Card, you can use the `backgroundImage` or `backgroundColor` property in the JSON schema that defines your card. The `backgroundColor` property is straightforward and allows you to set a solid color for the background.\n\nHere's an example of how to set the background color:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"AdaptiveCard\",\n  \"version\": \"1.5\",\n  \"body\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"TextBlock\",\n      \"text\": \"This card has a blue background.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"backgroundColor\": \"#0078D7\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `\"backgroundColor\": \"#0078D7\"` sets the background color of the Adaptive Card to a shade of blue (this is a common color used in Microsoft Teams).\n\nIf you want to set a more complex background, such as an image, you would use the `backgroundImage` property instead. However, note that `backgroundImage` does not support setting a solid color; it only supports images.\n\nRemember that the supported colors are in RGB hexadecimal format (`#RRGGBB`). If you need to include transparency, you can use RGBA format (`#AARRGGBB`), but this may depend on the platform or service that renders the Adaptive Card, as not all platforms support transparency in the background color.\n\nAlways refer to the specific documentation for the platform you're using, as there might be additional constraints or capabilities related to Adaptive Cards.", "input_size": 38, "output_sizes": [487, 456, 366, 350, 376, 308, 395, 496, 458, 610], "output_mean": 430.2, "output_std": 84.25, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 368.5, "p50": 425.5, "p75": 479.75, "p99": 599.74}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 24.06575}, {"sample_id": "fd87f678adf5df6b", "prompt_id": "0ac09f7df7595a3c", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "still error : PS C:\\Users\\Dan.QTIS\\Desktop\\Dan\\All Projects Full\\Ai App> c:;

This suggests that somewhere in your `main.py` file, there's an `except` clause without any indented code following it.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can resolve this issue:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Identify the Problematic Code**:\n   - The error message indicates that the problem occurs around line 105 and 108 of your `main.py` file.\n   - Open your `main.py` file and locate lines 105 to 108.\n\n2. **Check for Proper Indentation**:\n   - Ensure that any `except` clause has at least one indented line of code following it. For example:\n\n     ```python\n     try:\n         # Some code here\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(\"An error occurred:\", str(e))\n     ```\n\n     If your `except` clause looks like this:\n\n     ```python\n     try:\n         # Some code here\n     except Exception as e:\n     ```\n\n     It will cause an `IndentationError` because there is no indented block of code following the `except`.\n\n3. **Add Indented Code or Remove the `except` Clause**:\n   - If you intended to have an `except` clause, make sure to add some code within the indented block.\n   - If you didn't intend to have an `except` clause, remove the `except` keyword and its associated colon.\n\n### Example Fix\n\nAssuming your code looks something like this:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Some code here\nexcept Exception as e:\n```\n\nYou should modify it to include an indented block:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Some code here\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # Add some code here to handle the exception\n    print(\"An error occurred:\", str(e))\n```\n\nOr if you don't need the `except` clause, simply remove it:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Some code here\n```\n\n### General Tips for Debugging Indentation Errors\n\n- **Use a Text Editor with Syntax Highlighting**: Many modern text editors and IDEs highlight indentation errors visually.\n- **Consistent Indentation Style**: Stick to either spaces or tabs throughout your project. Mixing them can cause issues.\n- **Leverage Linters**: Tools like `flake8` or `black` can help catch indentation and other common syntax issues before running your script.\n\nBy fixing the indentation error, your script should run without crashing due to this specific issue.

This means that the code following the `except` clause isn't properly indented.\n\nIn Python, indentation is crucial as it defines the blocks of code. For example, if you have a try-except block, the code inside the `except` block must be indented correctly to indicate that it belongs to the `except` block.\n\nHere's an example of how a try-except block should look:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # some code that might raise an exception\n    pass\nexcept SomeException:\n    # code to handle the exception\n    print(\"An exception occurred!\")\n```\n\nMake sure that the lines following the `except` keyword are indented at least one level deeper than the `except` keyword itself. If you're unsure about where the error is located, you can open `main.py` and check around line 105 for proper indentation.\n\nIf you provide more details or the relevant part of your code, I could give more specific advice.", "input_size": 2529, "output_sizes": [474, 296, 440, 416, 512, 240, 483, 320, 298, 571], "output_mean": 405.0, "output_std": 104.39, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 303.5, "p50": 428.0, "p75": 480.75, "p99": 565.69}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 54.65277}, {"sample_id": "34bd8db56c3eeaa2", "prompt_id": "832bb1e0378dc51a", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "can I get a employer sponsorship while working remotely inside the US?", "longest_response": "Yes, it is possible to obtain an employer sponsorship for a work visa while working remotely in the United States, but there are several important factors and restrictions to consider:\n\n1. **Location of Employment**: If you are employed by a U.S. company but working remotely from outside the U.S., your situation might be simpler because you would typically be sponsored for a visa (like H-1B) once you plan to enter the U.S. for work purposes.\n\n2. **Working Remotely Inside the U.S.**: If you are already in the U.S. on a valid visa that allows employment (such as H-4 EAD, L-2 EAD, TN, O-3, etc.), you may be able to switch to another status that allows you to work for a new employer.

Well, if you\u2019re a business owner and you wish to build your own place, you wouldn\u2019t want a workplace with so many defects. And those can be avoided in a properly written commercial contract.\n\nA commercial contract is a document for non-residential building projects. It contains specific agreements between parties including their contractual obligations and scope of works. Additionally, this is usually used for business projects.\nLearn More: Construction Contract Types >\n\nContents of a\nCommercial Contract\nProject Details\nContract Information\nCustomer Details\nTerms and Conditions\nScope of Works\nSpecial Conditions\nInsurances\nContract Price\n\nWho can help with Commercial Contracts?\nA construction lawyer can be your best choice to consult your commercial building contracts.

Legal Advice\nYour building lawyer knows every aspect of a commercial contract that can either make or break your building project. Getting a lawyer involved earlier can guarantee you a seamless execution of the agreements in the contract. It will also less likely get you in a legal dispute.\n2. Contract Drafting\nSome disputes root from vague and badly written contracts. So it is important that everything written in your commercial contracts is clear. With the help of your building lawyer, any detail that needs to be removed, revised or added can easily be pointed out by your lawyer.\n3. Contract Review\nThere are a lot of things to look out for when reviewing a contract. Especially if it is a building contract. A building and construction lawyer can review your contract and point out any information that may seem vague or statements that can get you in trouble.\n\nAside from vague statements and details, it is also important to note that contract review includes checking if the contract is in written form, if all details are correct, if it includes dispute resolutions, and other important agreements to make sure the building process flows smoothly.\n\nWhy should you get your Commercial Contracts checked?\n1. Avoid bigger disputes.\nGetting involved in a building project is already stressful. You don\u2019t want another stress getting involved in a legal dispute. It spends too much time, money, and effort. So to make sure that you don\u2019t experience these struggles, seeking the right legal advice from the right person can do you a lot of help.\n2. Avoid any confusion.\nAny detail in your contract that seems ambiguous should be clarified and cleared out with the other party. It would be hard for the both of you if any confusion and misunderstanding arises halfway the building process. Worse, this could lead to a legal dispute and we don\u2019t want that.\n3. You don't miss anything.\nA building contract is like the detailed plan of the whole building project. When unexpected happenings suddenly occur, you have your contract to go back to. So when drafting a building contract, it is very important that there are more than just two voices speaking and more than two brains working together. Getting a legal expert to be part of the planning and contract drafting can give you assurance that anything that needs to be included in the contract is a preparation for both the expected and the unexpected.\n\nHow can Contracts Specialist help with Commercial Contracts?\nContracts Specialist is a Sydney-based law firm specialising in building and construction law.

A psychiatrist might refer a patient to a specialist if they suspect CRPS based on the symptoms described in the health records, but they would not make a definitive diagnosis without a comprehensive assessment.\n\nFor a proper diagnosis of CRPS in Ontario, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider who has experience in diagnosing and treating this condition.", "input_size": 81, "output_sizes": [352, 344, 446, 444, 357, 428, 303, 343, 347, 404], "output_mean": 376.8, "output_std": 47.14, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 344.75, "p50": 354.5, "p75": 422.0, "p99": 445.82}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 17.24787}, {"sample_id": "91aea3b568d04937", "prompt_id": "19dfe33f8125511c", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Do you know how to integrate Oauth2 into FastAPI?", "longest_response": "Yes, integrating OAuth2 with FastAPI can be achieved using the `fastapi-security` library or by using the `pydantic` and `starlette` libraries directly, which FastAPI is built upon. One of the most common ways to do this is by using the `FastAPI` framework in conjunction with `OAuth2PasswordBearer` for handling OAuth2 Bearer tokens.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might set up OAuth2 authentication in FastAPI:\n\n1. **Install Required Packages:**\n   Ensure you have FastAPI and Uvicorn installed. If not, install them using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install fastapi uvicorn\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Token Handler:**\n   Define a function to handle token generation and validation.\n\n3. **Set Up OAuth2 in FastAPI:**\n   Use `OAuth2PasswordBearer` to define an OAuth2 scheme.\n\n4. **Protect Endpoints:**\n   Use the OAuth2 scheme to protect your API endpoints.\n\nHere's a more detailed example:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nfrom fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException, status\nfrom fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer\nfrom jose import JWTError, jwt\nfrom passlib.context import CryptContext\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\n# Fake database\nfake_users_db = {\n    \"johndoe\": {\n        \"username\": \"johndoe\",\n        \"full_name\": \"John Doe\",\n        \"email\": \"johndoe@example.com\",\n        \"hashed_password\": \"$2b$12$EixZaYVK1fsbw1ZfbX3OXePaWxn96p36WQoeG6Lruj3vjPGga31lW\",  # hashed 'secret'\n        \"disabled\": False,\n    }\n}\n\n# Secret key for JWT\nSECRET_KEY = \"your_secret_key\"\nALGORITHM = \"HS256\"\nACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30\n\npwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=[\"bcrypt\"], deprecated=\"auto\")\noauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl=\"token\")\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\nclass Token(BaseModel):\n    access_token: str\n    token_type: str\n\nclass TokenData(BaseModel):\n    username: Optional[str] = None\n\nclass User(BaseModel):\n    username: str\n    email: Optional[str] = None\n    full_name: Optional[str] = None\n    disabled: Optional[bool] = None\n\nclass UserInDB(User):\n    hashed_password: str\n\ndef verify_password(plain_password, hashed_password):\n    return pwd_context.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)\n\ndef get_user(db, username: str):\n    if username in db:\n        user_dict = db[username]\n        return UserInDB(**user_dict)\n\ndef authenticate_user(fake_db, username: str, password: str):\n    user = get_user(fake_db, username)\n    if not user:\n        return False\n    if not verify_password(password, user.hashed_password):\n        return False\n    return user\n\ndef create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: Optional[timedelta] = None):\n    to_encode = data.copy()\n    if expires_delta:\n        expire = datetime.utcnow() + expires_delta\n    else:\n        expire = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=15)\n    to_encode.update({\"exp\": expire})\n    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)\n    return encoded_jwt\n\n@app.post(\"/token\", response_model=Token)\nasync def login_for_access_token(form_data):\n    user = authenticate_user(fake_users_db, form_data.username, form_data.password)\n    if not user:\n        raise HTTPException(\n            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,\n            detail=\"Incorrect username or password\",\n            headers={\"WWW-Authenticate\": \"Bearer\"},\n        )\n    access_token_expires = timedelta(minutes=ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES)\n    access_token = create_access_token(\n        data={\"sub\": user.username}, expires_delta=access_token_expires\n    )\n    return {\"access_token\": access_token, \"token_type\": \"bearer\"}\n\ndef get_current_user(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):\n    credentials_exception = HTTPException(\n        status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,\n        detail=\"Could not validate credentials\",\n        headers={\"WWW-Authenticate\": \"Bearer\"},\n    )\n    try:\n        payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])\n        username: str = payload.get(\"sub\")\n        if username is None:\n            raise credentials_exception\n        token_data = TokenData(username=username)\n    except JWTError:\n        raise credentials_exception\n    user = get_user(fake_users_db, username=token_data.username)\n    if user is None:\n        raise credentials_exception\n    return user\n\n@app.get(\"/users/me\")\nasync def read_users_me(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):\n    return current_user\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import uvicorn\n    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000)\n```\n\nThis example includes:\n- A simple fake database for demonstration purposes.\n- Token creation and validation logic.\n- An endpoint to generate tokens (`/token`).\n- An endpoint that requires authentication (`/users/me`).\n\nRemember to replace `\"your_secret_key\"` with your actual secret key for security reasons. Also, ensure that you're using HTTPS in production environments to secure your token transmission.\n\nThis setup uses the `OAuth2PasswordBearer` method, which is suitable for scenarios where you need to authenticate users via a token obtained from another service. For other OAuth2 flows (like authorization code flow), you would typically use an OAuth provider's SDKs or services like Auth0, Okta, etc., to handle the OAuth2 dance.", "shortest_response": "Yes, integrating OAuth2 into FastAPI can be done using the `fastapi-security` library, specifically `FastAPI` along with `pydantic` and `starlette-oauth`. Here\u2019s a basic guide on how to do it:\n\n### Step 1: Install Required Packages\n\nFirst, ensure you have FastAPI and Uvicorn (for running the app) installed. Additionally, install `starlette-oauth`, which provides OAuth2 support for Starlette (the web framework that FastAPI is built upon).\n\n```bash\npip install fastapi uvicorn starlette-oauth\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define Your OAuth2 Configuration\n\nCreate an OAuth2 configuration in your FastAPI application. This involves setting up OAuth2 providers like Google, GitHub, etc.\n\nHere's an example setup for Google OAuth2:\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException\nfrom fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer\nfrom starlette.config import Config\nfrom starlette.middleware.sessions import SessionMiddleware\nfrom starlette.requests import Request\nfrom starlette.responses import RedirectResponse\nfrom starlette.status import HTTP_303_SEE_OTHER\nfrom starlette_oauth import OAuth\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n# Configure OAuth2 provider\nconfig = Config('.env')  # Use environment variables or a .env file\noauth = OAuth(config)\ngoogle = oauth.google(\n    client_id=config('GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'),\n    client_secret=config('GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET'),\n    scope=['profile', 'email']\n)\n\n# Middleware for session management\napp.add_middleware(SessionMiddleware, secret_key=\"your-secret-key\")\n\n@app.route('/login')\nasync def login(request: Request):\n    redirect_uri = request.url_for('auth')\n    return await google.authorize_redirect(request, redirect_uri)\n\n@app.route('/auth')\nasync def auth(request: Request):\n    token = await google.authorize_access_token(request)\n    user = token.get(\"userinfo\")\n    if user:\n        request.session['user'] = dict(user)\n        return RedirectResponse(url=\"/\", status_code=HTTP_303_SEE_OTHER)\n    else:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=\"Login failed\")\n\n@app.get(\"/protected\")\ndef protected(user: dict = Depends(get_user_from_session)):\n    return {\"message\": f\"Hello {user['name']}!\"}\n\ndef get_user_from_session(request: Request):\n    user = request.session.get('user')\n    if not user:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"User not logged in\")\n    return user\n```\n\n### Step 3: Environment Variables\n\nMake sure to set up your environment variables (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`) in a `.env` file or directly in your environment.\n\nExample `.env` file:\n```plaintext\nGOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id\nGOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret\n```\n\n### Step 4: Run Your Application\n\nFinally, run your FastAPI application using Uvicorn:\n\n```bash\nuvicorn your_module_name:app --reload\n```\n\nReplace `your_module_name` with the name of the Python module where your FastAPI application is defined.\n\nThis setup provides a basic OAuth2 integration with Google for authentication purposes. You can extend this example to include other OAuth2 providers by adding more configurations and routes as needed.\n\nRemember, handling OAuth2 securely requires careful consideration of security best practices, such as securing secrets, handling tokens properly, and ensuring secure communication over HTTPS.", "input_size": 42, "output_sizes": [871, 1224, 787, 720, 990, 871, 895, 922, 779, 955], "output_mean": 901.4, "output_std": 133.45, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 808.0, "p50": 883.0, "p75": 946.75, "p99": 1202.94}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 56.55573}, {"sample_id": "cc43387119afa550", "prompt_id": "c8ddeb16364e3b5a", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "how to run a nats server with a local docker. the server should run on another port than the default and needs to have jetstream enabled. the nats server storage should be in a volume that persists the data when the container is restarted.", "longest_response": "To run a NATS server with JetStream enabled using Docker, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Pull the NATS Docker Image**: First, ensure you have Docker installed on your system.

This was no ordinary castle; it was the setting of legends, where the boundaries between the living and the dead blurred into an eerie twilight. Known as the Castle of the Veiled Nun, it had been the site of countless mysterious occurrences and unexplained phenomena.\n\nFrom the depths of space, a sleek, otherworldly craft descended silently into the night sky. As it landed gracefully in the courtyard, the doors of the craft slid open, revealing a figure that seemed almost out of place among the dark, foreboding surroundings. He was tall and imposing, with skin that shimmered like polished obsidian, and eyes that glowed with an inner light, as if they were windows to a universe beyond comprehension. His name was Zorath, an emissary from a distant planet, a being of unparalleled intelligence and power, often referred to as a \"superman\" due to his godlike abilities.\n\nZorath stepped out of the ship, his movements fluid and graceful. He had come to this forsaken place not out of curiosity or fear, but because he sought answers to questions that even the most advanced civilizations could not answer. The legends spoke of a force within the castle that defied explanation, a presence that could bend reality itself. Zorath was intrigued.\n\n#### Chapter 2: The First Encounter\n\nAs Zorath ventured inside the castle, the air grew colder, and the shadows seemed to deepen. The walls, adorned with centuries-old tapestries and stained glass windows depicting scenes of horror and despair, watched him with silent judgment. The castle was alive, pulsating with an unseen energy.\n\nSuddenly, the lights flickered, and a cold wind swept through the halls, extinguishing the few remaining candles. In the darkness, a faint whisper began to rise, growing louder until it echoed off the stone walls. \"Who dares disturb my slumber?\" The voice was that of a woman, aged and weary, yet filled with an unsettling power.\n\nZorath paused, his glowing eyes scanning the darkness. \"I am Zorath,\" he replied calmly. \"An emissary from another world. I seek understanding.\"\n\nThe whisper turned into a cackle, a sound that sent shivers down even Zorath's spine. \"Understanding? You dare seek knowledge here? This is the realm of the damned, the cursed, the forgotten!\"\n\nFrom the shadows emerged a figure wrapped in tattered, blood-stained robes. Her face was obscured by a veil, and her eyes glowed with an unnatural light. She was the Veiled Nun, guardian of the castle's secrets and protector of its dark legacy.\n\n\"You are not welcome here,\" she hissed, her voice dripping with malice. \"Leave now, before you become another soul lost to the darkness.\"\n\nZorath regarded her with a curious gaze. \"I am not easily deterred by threats,\" he said, his voice calm and steady. \"Show me what you have to offer.\"\n\n#### Chapter 3: The Haunting Begins\n\nThe Veiled Nun's eyes narrowed, and she raised her hand, summoning forth a wave of spectral energy. Shadows coalesced around her, forming twisted shapes that lunged at Zorath with razor-sharp claws. But the alien's reflexes were too quick. With a mere thought, he erected a force field around himself, deflecting the attack effortlessly.\n\n\"Impressive,\" he mused, his tone devoid of emotion. \"But not enough to truly challenge me.\"\n\nUndeterred, the Veiled Nun called upon the castle's ancient magic, causing the very stones to shake and tremble. Portraits fell from the walls, and the floor beneath Zorath cracked and split, revealing a chasm of darkness. Yet, the alien stood firm, his godlike powers allowing him to manipulate the very fabric of reality.\n\nHe reached out, his fingers glowing with a soft blue light, and the ground beneath the Veiled Nun began to shift and twist. She stumbled, her hold on the castle's magic faltering. But she was not one to give up easily. With a scream of rage, she unleashed a torrent of dark energy, enveloping Zorath in a vortex of shadows.\n\n#### Chapter 4: The Unseen Battle\n\nInside the vortex, Zorath's mind raced. The Veiled Nun's magic was potent, drawing on the very essence of the castle's dark history. But Zorath was more than a match for her. Using his advanced technology and innate abilities, he countered her attacks, pushing back against the tide of darkness.\n\nTheir battle raged on, each strike and counterstrike echoing through the castle's halls. The Veiled Nun's powers fluctuated, growing stronger and then fading, as if she were drawing strength from the castle's own malevolent energies. But Zorath remained unyielding, his defenses impenetrable.\n\nFinally, the Veiled Nun made a desperate move, channeling all her remaining power into a final assault. The castle shook violently, and the walls seemed to close in, threatening to crush them both. But Zorath was ready. With a surge of energy, he shattered the vortex, sending the Veiled Nun flying backward.\n\nShe landed hard, her body convulsing as the last of her power drained away. The shadows receded, and the castle's oppressive atmosphere dissipated. Zorath approached her cautiously, his eyes still glowing with an otherworldly light.\n\n\"You are formidable,\" he said, extending a hand to help her up. \"But you are not my equal.\"\n\nThe Veiled Nun looked up at him, her eyes filled with a mix of fear and awe. \"What...what are you?\" she stammered.\n\n\"I am Zorath,\" he replied. \"A visitor from another world, seeking knowledge and understanding. Perhaps we can find common ground.\"\n\n#### Chapter 5: Revelation and Departure\n\nOver the next few days, Zorath and the Veiled Nun formed an unlikely alliance. The nun, though initially wary, found herself drawn to the alien's wisdom and compassion. Together, they delved deeper into the castle's mysteries, uncovering ancient relics and forgotten lore.\n\nThrough their shared experiences, the Veiled Nun began to see the castle not just as a prison of darkness, but as a repository of untold knowledge. And Zorath, in turn, gained insights into the nature of fear, grief, and redemption that transcended his own understanding.\n\nAs the time came for Zorath to leave, the Veiled Nun stood by the castle gates, watching him ascend into the night sky. She felt a sense of loss, but also a newfound hope.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the wind. \"For showing me there is more to this place than pain and suffering.\"\n\nZorath turned back, his eyes filled with warmth. \"Perhaps, one day, you will find your own path to peace,\" he said, before the craft vanished into the stars.\n\nAnd so, the Castle of the Veiled Nun remained, a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit, even in the face of the unknown.", "shortest_response": "### The Haunted Castle's Unyielding Guest\n\nIn the shadowy depths of a forgotten European countryside, where ancient legends whispered through the cobwebs of time, stood a castle cloaked in mist and mystery. Its crumbling walls and arched windows were shrouded in tales of supernatural horrors and unspeakable tragedies. This was the castle of St. Albrice, infamous for its haunting and the tragic tale of the Nun who had sealed herself within its walls.\n\nFrom beyond the stars, a being of unparalleled intellect and power found himself drawn to this place. His name was Zorathar, an extraterrestrial entity of extraordinary wisdom and strength. He possessed the ability to manipulate matter, energy, and even the fabric of reality itself. Yet, despite his godlike prowess, there was something about the castle that intrigued him\u2014a challenge, perhaps, or a puzzle waiting to be solved.\n\nZorathar descended upon Earth, his arrival marked by a fleeting shimmer in the night sky. As he approached the castle, he felt the weight of centuries pressing down upon him, the echoes of sorrow and despair lingering in the air. The castle itself seemed to loom larger than life, its spires reaching towards the heavens like accusing fingers.\n\nAs Zorathar stepped inside, the doors creaked ominously behind him, sealing off the outside world. The castle was a labyrinth of dark corridors and shadowy chambers, each one more foreboding than the last. The air grew colder, and an eerie silence settled over everything.\n\nSuddenly, a figure materialized before him\u2014a ghostly apparition of a nun, her eyes hollow and filled with an unquenchable hatred. She was Sister Maria, the nun whose spirit had been trapped here for generations, doomed to haunt the castle and those who dared to enter.\n\n\"Surrender your soul,\" she hissed, her voice echoing through the chamber. \"This is my domain, and I will not let you leave.\"\n\nZorathar regarded her with a calm, almost amused expression. \"Your threats are quaint, but they hold no sway over me,\" he replied, his voice resonating with an otherworldly authority.\n\nSister Maria\u2019s eyes flared with an ethereal light as she lunged at him, her spectral form dissipating into a cloud of darkness. But Zorathar merely raised a hand, and the darkness recoiled, unable to harm him. He could feel the fear emanating from her, the desperation of a being bound by its own past.\n\n\"Your anger is understandable, but it is futile,\" Zorathar continued, his tone gentle yet firm. \"There is no need for you to suffer any longer.\"\n\nWith a wave of his hand, he projected an image before them\u2014a vision of the nun\u2019s life, her struggles, and the tragic circumstances that led to her imprisonment. Sister Maria watched in stunned silence, her hatred slowly giving way to sorrow and understanding.\n\n\"You were wronged,\" Zorathar said softly. \"But your vengeance only perpetuates the cycle of suffering. There must be another way.\"\n\nThe nun\u2019s spectral form began to flicker, her presence growing weaker as the grip of her torment loosened. Zorathar sensed her resolve fading, her spirit yearning for release. With a final gesture, he reached out, his consciousness intertwining with hers.\n\nA blinding light erupted from their connection, illuminating the dark chamber. Sister Maria\u2019s form dissipated, her essence finally free from the confines of the castle. The oppressive atmosphere lifted, and the coldness in the air vanished.\n\nZorathar stood alone in the now peaceful hall, the weight of the past lifting from the castle\u2019s walls. The ghosts that had once haunted these halls were gone, replaced by a sense of quiet resolution.\n\nAs dawn broke over the horizon, casting a golden glow across the countryside, Zorathar turned to depart. The castle, once a symbol of terror and despair, now stood silent and serene, its dark history laid to rest. Zorathar left behind a legacy of hope and redemption, a testament to the power of understanding and compassion, even in the face of the most formidable of foes.\n\nAnd as he soared back into the vast expanse of the cosmos, he knew that somewhere, in the heart of a haunted castle, peace had been restored.", "input_size": 140, "output_sizes": [1112, 1407, 1025, 1022, 937, 983, 889, 899, 1196, 1506], "output_mean": 1097.6, "output_std": 201.31, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 948.5, "p50": 1023.5, "p75": 1175.0, "p99": 1497.09}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 77.39091}, {"sample_id": "c09d7a4d87ea375d", "prompt_id": "938905992ba7b8fe", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "how to debug which view is getting called in django", "longest_response": "Debugging which view is being called in Django can be done through several methods. Here are some common approaches:\n\n### 1. Using `print` Statements\nThe simplest way to debug is to add print statements inside your views to see when they are executed.\n\n```python\ndef my_view(request):\n    print(\"my_view is being called\")\n    # Your view logic here\n```\n\n### 2. Using Django Debug Toolbar\nDjango Debug Toolbar is a configurable set of panels displaying various debug information about the current request/response. It can help you understand what's happening during each request.\n\n- Install it via pip:\n  ```bash\n  pip install django-debug-toolbar\n  ```\n\n- Add `'debug_toolbar',` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.\n\n- Add `'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware',` to your `MIDDLEWARE` setting (make sure it\u2019s after `django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware`).\n\n- Configure the internal IP addresses that can see the toolbar:\n  ```python\n  INTERNAL_IPS = [\n      \"127.0.0.1\",\n  ]\n  ```\n\n- Add the context processor:\n  ```python\n  INSTALLED_APPS = [\n      ...\n      'debug_toolbar',\n  ]\n\n  MIDDLEWARE = [\n      ...\n      'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware',\n  ]\n\n  TEMPLATES = [\n      {\n          ...\n          'OPTIONS': {\n              'context_processors': [\n                  ...\n                  'debug_toolbar.context_processors.debug',\n                  'debug_toolbar.context_processors.request',\n                  ...\n              ],\n          },\n      },\n  ]\n  ```\n\n### 3. Logging\nDjango has a built-in logging framework which can be very useful for debugging. You can log messages from within your views and configure Django to output these logs in a way that is easy to read.\n\n- Configure logging in your `settings.py`:\n  ```python\n  LOGGING = {\n      'version': 1,\n      'disable_existing_loggers': False,\n      'handlers': {\n          'console': {\n              'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',\n          },\n      },\n      'loggers': {\n          'django': {\n              'handlers': ['console'],\n              'level': os.getenv('DJANGO_LOG_LEVEL', 'INFO'),\n          },\n      },\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Use logging in your view:\n  ```python\n  import logging\n  logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n  def my_view(request):\n      logger.info('my_view is being called')\n      # Your view logic here\n  ```\n\n### 4. Middleware\nYou can write custom middleware to log or print information about requests as they pass through your application.\n\n- Create a middleware file, e.g., `middleware.py`:\n  ```python\n  class RequestLoggingMiddleware:\n      def __init__(self, get_response):\n          self.get_response = get_response\n\n      def __call__(self, request):\n          print(f\"Request path: {request.path}\")\n          response = self.get_response(request)\n          return response\n  ```\n\n- Add the middleware to your `MIDDLEWARE` setting:\n  ```python\n  MIDDLEWARE = [\n      ...\n      'your_app.middleware.RequestLoggingMiddleware',\n  ]\n  ```\n\n### 5. URL Resolver\nIf you want to know which URL pattern matches a particular request, you can use Django\u2019s URL resolver.\n\n- In your shell or a view, you can use:\n  ```python\n  from django.urls import resolve\n\n  match = resolve('/path/to/view/')\n  print(match.func)  # This will print the view function associated with the URL\n  ```\n\nUsing one or more of these methods should help you identify which view is being called and potentially why it might not be behaving as expected.", "shortest_response": "Debugging which view is getting called in Django can be done through several methods. Here are some common strategies:\n\n### 1. Using `print` Statements\nThe simplest way to see which view is being called is to add a `print` statement at the beginning of each view function.\n\n```python\ndef my_view(request):\n    print(\"my_view is being called\")\n    # Your view logic here\n```\n\n### 2. Using Django's Debug Toolbar\nDjango Debug Toolbar is a configurable set of panels displaying various debug information about the current request/response. One of its features is showing the list of executed SQL queries and the context of the view that was called.\n\n- Install it via pip: `pip install django-debug-toolbar`\n- Add `'debug_toolbar',` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.\n- Add `'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware',` to your `MIDDLEWARE`.\n- Configure `INTERNAL_IPS` in your settings file.\n- Include the toolbar in your urls.py if necessary.\n\n### 3. Using Django's Logging Framework\nDjango has a built-in logging framework that you can use to log messages when a view is called.\n\nIn your settings file (`settings.py`), configure the logging:\n\n```python\nLOGGING = {\n    'version': 1,\n    'disable_existing_loggers': False,\n    'handlers': {\n        'console': {\n            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',\n        },\n    },\n    'loggers': {\n        'django.request': {\n            'handlers': ['console'],\n            'level': 'DEBUG',\n            'propagate': True,\n        },\n    },\n}\n```\n\nThen in your views:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\ndef my_view(request):\n    logger.debug('my_view is being called')\n    # Your view logic here\n```\n\n### 4. Using Middleware\nCreate a middleware class that logs the name of the view being called.\n\n```python\nfrom django.utils.deprecation import MiddlewareMixin\n\nclass ViewLoggerMiddleware(MiddlewareMixin):\n    def process_view(self, request, view_func, view_args, view_kwargs):\n        print(f\"Calling view {view_func.__name__}\")\n        return None\n```\n\nAdd this middleware to your `MIDDLEWARE` setting in `settings.py`.\n\n### 5. Using Django's `traceback` Module\nIf an error occurs, Django will show you the traceback, which includes the view that caused the error.\n\n### 6. Using Django\u2019s Built-in Error Reporting\nEnsure that `DEBUG` is set to `True` in your `settings.py` during development. This will provide detailed error pages that include the stack trace and context, making it easier to see which view was called.\n\n### Conclusion\nUsing any of these methods should help you identify which view is being called when certain actions occur in your Django application. For production environments, it's recommended to avoid using `print` statements or setting `DEBUG=True`, as they can expose sensitive information. Instead, rely on logging and proper middleware configurations.", "input_size": 39, "output_sizes": [624, 623, 714, 766, 718, 730, 641, 687, 725, 671], "output_mean": 689.9, "output_std": 46.45, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 648.5, "p50": 700.5, "p75": 723.25, "p99": 762.76}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 31.53681}, {"sample_id": "84518b7fe5dd65d0", "prompt_id": "045849e53d985d43", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "base one this\"The circular economy is a production and consumption model aimed at keeping resources in use for as long as possible by changing the way we produce, consume, and utilize resources, thereby reducing emissions from resource extraction, manufacturing, transportation, and disposal. and extracting the maximum value from them before recovering and regenerating materials at the end of their service life. \n\nAccording to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a leading circular economy advocacy group, a circular economy can help reduce global carbon emissions by 9.3 billion tons by 2050, equivalent to eliminating current emissions from all forms of transport globally. Additionally, a report by the World Economic Forum estimates that the circular economy could generate $4.5 trillion in economic benefits by 2030, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 39%.\n\nVolvo is a good example of a company implementing circular economy principles. In 2018, Volvo announced its ambition to become a circular business by 2040, which includes measures such as:\n1 .Designing new products, packaging, and services according to circular economy principles, including making products more durable, repairable, and recyclable.\n2.

He is perhaps best known for his theories on simulation and hyperreality, which have had significant impacts on fields ranging from cultural studies to media theory. His writings often challenge traditional notions of reality and representation, suggesting that in modern societies, we are surrounded by signs and simulations that may be more real than the \"real\" itself.\n\nBaudrillard's philosophical approach is deeply rooted in the idea that our understanding of reality is mediated through systems of signs and symbols. In his seminal works such as \"Simulacra and Simulation\" (1981), he argues that in postmodern societies, the distinction between reality and its representations has become blurred, leading to a condition where simulations dominate our perception of the world. This essay will explore key aspects of Baudrillard\u2019s philosophy, focusing on his concepts of simulation, hyperreality, and the collapse of meaning in contemporary culture.\n\n### The Concept of Simulation\n\nAt the heart of Baudrillard's philosophy lies the concept of simulation. According to Baudrillard, simulation is not merely a copy of something but a process through which the original is replaced by an artificial or constructed version. In his own words:\n\n> \"Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being or a substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal. The territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it. It is nevertheless the map that precedes the territory\u2014precession of simulacra\u2014that engenders the territory.\"\n\nThis passage highlights Baudrillard's belief that the model or simulation can precede and even generate the reality it supposedly represents. This inversion of the relationship between reality and its representations challenges the notion of an objective, stable reality.\n\n### Hyperreality and the Collapse of Meaning\n\nBuilding on the concept of simulation, Baudrillard introduces the idea of hyperreality, which describes a condition where simulations and signs have taken precedence over the real. In this state, the boundaries between the real and the artificial dissolve, leading to a condition where the distinction between what is real and what is not becomes irrelevant. As Baudrillard explains:\n\n> \"The territory of the real is always prioritized over the map, but today, the map precedes the territory\u2014there is no longer any territory. The map is the territory. The territory is a copy of the map. Reality itself is now a copy of the map.\"\n\nIn this context, reality is seen as a construct, a collection of signs and symbols that do not necessarily correspond to an underlying truth. This leads to a situation where the meaning of things is constantly shifting and becoming increasingly detached from any fixed or stable reference points.\n\n### The Precession of Simulacra\n\nOne of Baudrillard's most influential ideas is the \"precession of simulacra,\" which suggests that simulations and representations precede and shape the reality they are meant to represent. This concept is closely tied to the idea that our perceptions and experiences are mediated by a complex network of signs and symbols. Baudrillard writes:\n\n> \"The precession of simulacra signifies that the signifier no longer refers to a referent, but to another signifier. The chain of signification is thus closed upon itself, forming a self-referential system. There is no longer any outside, any exteriority, any depth. Everything is surface, everything is on the same level.\"\n\nThis idea challenges traditional semiotic theories that rely on the existence of an external referent for signs. Instead, Baudrillard posits a system where signs are interconnected in a way that creates their own reality, independent of any external referents.\n\n### Critique of Modernity and Consumer Culture\n\nBaudrillard's critique extends beyond abstract philosophical concepts to encompass modernity and consumer culture. He argues that in contemporary capitalist societies, commodities and consumption patterns are central to the construction of identity and social relations. However, this process also leads to a form of alienation, where individuals are trapped within a system of signs and simulations. As Baudrillard observes:\n\n> \"We live in a world where there is more and more information, and less and less meaning; more and more things, and less and less significance. We are drowning in information and starving for knowledge.\"\n\nThis critique underscores the paradoxical nature of modern life, where an abundance of information and material goods does not necessarily lead to greater fulfillment or understanding. Instead, it contributes to a sense of disorientation and detachment from authentic experience.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nJean Baudrillard's philosophy offers a profound and provocative critique of contemporary society, challenging us to reconsider our assumptions about reality, representation, and meaning. Through his concepts of simulation, hyperreality, and the precession of simulacra, Baudrillard invites us to question the very foundations of our understanding of the world. His work remains relevant today, providing valuable insights into the complexities of modern life and the role of media and technology in shaping our perceptions and experiences.\n\nIn summary, Baudrillard's philosophy is a call to awareness, urging us to critically examine the systems of signs and symbols that structure our lives and to consider the implications of living in a world dominated by simulations and hyperreality. His writings continue to inspire discussions and debates across various disciplines, making him one of the most influential thinkers of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.", "shortest_response": "Jean Baudrillard (1929-2007) was a French philosopher, sociologist, and cultural theorist whose work significantly influenced postmodern thought. He is best known for his critiques of contemporary Western societies, particularly in relation to media, consumerism, and technology. His writings explore the idea that reality has been replaced by hyperreality\u2014a condition where simulations and representations have become more real than the actual events they represent. This essay will delve into the core philosophies of Baudrillard, with extensive excerpts from his seminal works.\n\n### The Concept of Hyperreality\n\nBaudrillard's concept of hyperreality is central to his critique of modern society. In \"Simulacra and Simulation\" (1981), he argues that our world is increasingly populated by simulacra\u2014copies without originals\u2014and that these simulacra have become so ubiquitous and convincing that they have replaced reality itself. Baudrillard writes:\n\n> \"We live in a society where there is no truth, no reality, only the model of a simulated truth, the model of a simulated reality.\" (Baudrillard, Simulacra and Simulation)\n\nIn this passage, Baudrillard suggests that what we consider as reality is actually a simulation or model, which is so perfect that it has come to replace any notion of an original reality. This leads to a state of hyperreality, where simulations are not just imitations but become the dominant form of existence.\n\n### The Role of Media and Consumer Culture\n\nBaudrillard's analysis extends to the role of media and consumer culture in creating and sustaining this hyperreal environment. He argues that media representations of reality are so pervasive and influential that they shape our perception of the world. In \"The Gulf War Did Not Take Place\" (1995), Baudrillard provocatively claims that the Gulf War was not a real event but rather a series of media representations that created the illusion of a war. He writes:\n\n> \"The Gulf War did not take place: it was a televised event, a spectacle, a show, a fiction, a simulacrum. It was not a war, but a simulation of a war, a war in the media sense, a war in the sense of CNN.\" (Baudrillard, The Gulf War Did Not Take Place)\n\nThis statement challenges the traditional understanding of events and their representation. For Baudrillard, the Gulf War, like many other significant events, was experienced through its media portrayal, making it impossible to distinguish between the event itself and its mediated representation.\n\n### Critique of Modernity and Postmodernity\n\nBaudrillard's work also reflects a deep critique of modernity and its transition into postmodernity. He sees modernity as characterized by the belief in progress, rationality, and the possibility of objective knowledge. However, he argues that these ideals have been subverted by the very systems they were meant to serve. In \"The Transparency of Evil\" (1993), Baudrillard discusses how modern systems of power and control have paradoxically led to a condition of transparency and visibility that obfuscates genuine meaning:\n\n> \"Transparency is the enemy of meaning. In a transparent world, everything is visible, but nothing is seen. Everything is accessible, but nothing is understood. We are surrounded by signs, but we do not read them.\" (Baudrillard, The Transparency of Evil)\n\nHere, Baudrillard points out that the excessive visibility and accessibility of information in modern society do not lead to greater understanding or clarity. Instead, they create a superficial layer of information that obscures deeper meanings and truths.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nJean Baudrillard's philosophical explorations offer a profound critique of contemporary society, emphasizing the role of media, consumer culture, and technological advancements in shaping our perceptions of reality. Through his concepts of hyperreality and simulacra, Baudrillard challenges us to reconsider what we understand as real and true. His work remains relevant today, as we continue to navigate a world increasingly defined by digital media and virtual experiences.\n\nBy examining Baudrillard's ideas through excerpts from his writings, we gain insight into his complex and often controversial perspectives on modernity and postmodernity.

Below is a simple example of how to read data from an Excel file:\n\n```javascript\nconst XLSX = require('xlsx');\n\n// Load the workbook from a file\nconst workbook = XLSX.readFile('path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx');\n\n// Get the first worksheet\nconst worksheetName = workbook.SheetNames[0];\nconst worksheet = workbook.Sheets[worksheetName];\n\n// Convert the worksheet to JSON format\nconst data = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(worksheet);\n\nconsole.log(data);\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `XLSX.readFile()` reads the Excel file.\n- `workbook.SheetNames[0]` accesses the first sheet name in the workbook.\n- `workbook.Sheets[worksheetName]` gets the worksheet object.\n- `XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json()` converts the worksheet to a JSON array, where each row becomes an object with column names as keys.\n\n### Handling Multiple Sheets\n\nIf your workbook contains multiple sheets and you want to process all of them, you can loop through `SheetNames`:\n\n```javascript\nconst workbook = XLSX.readFile('path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx');\nconst sheetNames = workbook.SheetNames;\n\nsheetNames.forEach(sheetName => {\n    const worksheet = workbook.Sheets[sheetName];\n    const data = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(worksheet);\n    \n    console.log(`Data from ${sheetName}:`);\n    console.log(data);\n});\n```\n\nThis code will print out the content of every sheet in the workbook.\n\n### Writing Data Back to Excel\n\nIf you also need to write data back into an Excel file, you can use the following methods:\n\n```javascript\nconst workbook = XLSX.readFile('path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx');\nconst worksheetName = workbook.SheetNames[0];\nconst worksheet = workbook.Sheets[worksheetName];\n\n// Modify or add data here...\n\n// Convert the JSON data back to a worksheet\nconst newData = [{ A: 'New', B: 'Row' }];\nconst newWorksheet = XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet(newData);\n\n// Replace the old worksheet with the new one\nworkbook.Sheets[worksheetName] = newWorksheet;\n\n// Write the workbook back to a file\nXLSX.writeFile(workbook, 'path/to/your/new/excel/file.xlsx');\n```\n\nThis script reads an existing Excel file, modifies it by adding a new row, and then writes the modified workbook back to a new file.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUsing the `xlsx` package, you can easily read, manipulate, and write Excel files in Node.js. This makes it a powerful tool for applications that need to interact with Excel data.", "shortest_response": "Reading an Excel file in Node.js can be achieved using several libraries, but one of the most popular and widely used is `xlsx`. This library allows you to read and write Excel files (both `.xls` and `.xlsx` formats) easily.\n\nHere's how you can use `xlsx` to read an Excel file:\n\n1. First, you need to install the `xlsx` package. You can do this via npm (Node Package Manager):\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install xlsx\n   ```\n\n2. Once the package is installed, you can use it in your Node.js application to read an Excel file. Below is an example of how to read data from an Excel file:\n\n```javascript\nconst XLSX = require('xlsx');\n\n// Function to read an Excel file\nfunction readExcelFile(filePath) {\n    // Read the workbook\n    const workbook = XLSX.readFile(filePath);\n\n    // Specify which sheet you want to work with\n    const sheetName = workbook.SheetNames[0]; // Assuming you want to read the first sheet\n\n    // Parse the sheet data into JSON format\n    const worksheet = workbook.Sheets[sheetName];\n    const data = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(worksheet);\n\n    console.log(data);\n}\n\n// Example usage\nreadExcelFile('path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx');\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The `readFile` method reads the workbook from the specified file path.\n- `SheetNames[0]` accesses the first sheet in the workbook. If you know the name of the specific sheet you want to read, you can replace `SheetNames[0]` with the actual sheet name.\n- `sheet_to_json` converts the worksheet into a JSON array where each object represents a row in the spreadsheet.\n\nMake sure to replace `'path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx'` with the actual path to your Excel file on your system.\n\nThis is a basic example, and the `xlsx` library offers much more functionality, such as handling different formats, styles, and advanced operations on Excel files.

The simplicity and brevity of haiku make them both accessible and profound.\n\n#### Structure of a Haiku\n1. **Line 1**: 5 syllables\n2. **Line 2**: 7 syllables\n3. **Line 3**: 5 syllables\n\n#### Example of a Haiku\nLet's look at a classic example by Matsuo Bash\u014d, one of the most famous haiku poets:\n\n**Original (in Japanese):**\n\u79cb\u306e\u591c\u306b  \n\u6708\u306e\u5f71  \n\u77f3\u306b\u63cf\u304f  \n\n**English Translation:**\nAn autumn night\u2014  \nthe moon\u2019s shadow  \ndrawn on a stone  \n\nThis haiku captures a serene scene of a moonlit night where the shadow of the moon seems to be drawn on a stone, creating a peaceful and reflective mood.\n\n### How to Write a Haiku\n1. **Choose a Moment**: Think of a moment that you find meaningful or beautiful, often something simple from nature.\n2. **Use Simple Language**: Keep your language straightforward and avoid complex words or phrases.\n3. **Focus on Sensory Details**: Use sensory details like sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures to paint a vivid picture.\n4. **Follow the 5-7-5 Syllable Pattern**: Ensure each line has the correct number of syllables.\n5. **Include a Season Word (Kigo)**: A kigo is a word that indicates the season, helping to set the context of the poem.\n\n#### Writing Your Own Haiku\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you write your own haiku:\n\n1. **Brainstorm Moments**: Think about moments you've experienced in nature that you found particularly striking or moving.\n2. **Pick One Moment**: Choose one moment and think about what made it special.\n3. **Write Lines**: Start forming lines that capture this moment, aiming for the 5-7-5 syllable structure.\n4. **Refine**: Make sure your haiku feels complete and conveys a clear image or feeling.\n\n### Example Haiku Creation\nLet\u2019s try writing a haiku together. Suppose you\u2019ve noticed the first snowfall of the winter.\n\n1. **Moment**: First snowfall.\n2. **Details**: Soft white flakes, quiet atmosphere, trees and ground covered in snow.\n3. **Lines**:\n   - Line 1: Soft snow descends (5 syllables)\n   - Line 2: Trees whisper, silent (7 syllables)\n   - Line 3: Winter whispers back (5 syllables)\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get:\n\n**Haiku:**\nSoft snow descends,  \nTrees whisper, silent world,  \nWinter whispers back.\n\n### Questions\nDo you have any questions about the examples provided or about how to write your own haiku?", "shortest_response": "### Understanding Japanese Haiku\n\n#### What is a Haiku?\n\nA haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry that consists of three lines and seventeen syllables in total, structured in a 5-7-5 pattern (five syllables in the first line, seven in the second, and five in the third). Haikus often capture a moment in nature or express a feeling or emotion, using vivid imagery and concise language.\n\n#### Example of a Haiku\n\nLet's look at an example of a haiku:\n\n**Snow Melts Slowly**\nSnow melts slowly,\nDewdrops on cherry blossoms\u2014\nSpring whispers softly.\n\nThis haiku follows the 5-7-5 structure and paints a picture of spring, focusing on the delicate transition from winter to spring through the melting snow and dew-covered cherry blossoms.\n\n#### How to Write a Haiku\n\n1. **Choose Your Subject**: Start by selecting a subject that interests you, such as a season, an animal, or a natural phenomenon.\n2. **Capture a Moment**: Think of a specific moment or image related to your chosen subject.\n3. **Use Vivid Imagery**: Use descriptive words to paint a clear picture for the reader.\n4. **Follow the Structure**: Ensure your poem follows the 5-7-5 syllable count.\n\nHere\u2019s how you might write a simple haiku about autumn leaves:\n\n**Autumn Leaves Falling**\nLeaves rustle, fall,\nCrisp air and colors changing\u2014\nWinter soon calls.\n\n#### Try Writing One Yourself\n\nNow it's your turn! Try writing a haiku about something you see around you or something that inspires you. Remember to follow the 5-7-5 syllable pattern and use vivid imagery.\n\nDo you have any questions about this example or the process of writing a haiku?", "input_size": 118, "output_sizes": [563, 400, 545, 538, 510, 374, 483, 520, 628, 499], "output_mean": 506.0, "output_std": 70.8, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 487.0, "p50": 515.0, "p75": 543.25, "p99": 622.15}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 26.0572}, {"sample_id": "2439d074c62ce4ea", "prompt_id": "12822a8eb891ec2d", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "What were the technical, financial, and marketing challenges facing Drinks-Up!?", "longest_response": "To accurately address the challenges that Drinks-Up! might have faced, I'll need to make some assumptions based on typical issues that beverage companies encounter. Drinks-Up! is not a real company, so let's consider it as a hypothetical business in the beverage industry. Here\u2019s how they might have been challenged across different dimensions:\n\n### Technical Challenges\n\n1. **Product Formulation**: Developing a unique and appealing product formulation can be complex. Ensuring that the drink tastes good while meeting nutritional standards and avoiding artificial additives can be challenging.\n   \n2. **Production Efficiency**: Scaling up production to meet demand without compromising quality can be difficult. Managing supply chains for raw materials and ensuring consistent product quality across batches is another significant challenge.\n\n3. **Packaging Innovation**: Staying competitive often requires innovative packaging that stands out on store shelves. This involves balancing aesthetic appeal with practical considerations like cost, durability, and recyclability.\n\n4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Navigating the maze of regulations related to food safety, labeling, and advertising can be a daunting task. Non-compliance can lead to fines or recalls.\n\n### Financial Challenges\n\n1. **High Initial Costs**: Starting a new beverage company typically requires substantial upfront investment for equipment, ingredients, and marketing.\n   \n2. **Profit Margins**: Beverage companies often face thin profit margins due to high competition and low consumer price sensitivity for many products.\n   \n3. **Investment Attraction**: Securing funding from investors can be tough, especially if the business model isn\u2019t proven or if the market is saturated.\n\n4. **Cash Flow Management**: Managing cash flow effectively is crucial. Delayed payments from distributors and retailers can strain finances.\n\n### Marketing Challenges\n\n1. **Brand Differentiation**: In a crowded market, standing out is difficult. Creating a compelling brand story and identity that resonates with consumers is essential but challenging.\n   \n2. **Consumer Trends**: Keeping up with rapidly changing consumer preferences and health trends (like organic, non-GMO, low-sugar) is critical but can be costly and time-consuming.\n   \n3. **Distribution Channels**: Gaining access to retail shelf space and negotiating favorable terms with distributors can be tough, especially for smaller brands.\n   \n4. **Marketing Budgets**: Competing against established brands often requires significant marketing spend. Small budgets may limit the ability to reach target audiences effectively.\n\nBy addressing these challenges through strategic planning, innovation, and effective resource management, Drinks-Up! could position itself for success in a competitive market.", "shortest_response": "It seems there might be some confusion or a typo in your question. \"Drinks-Up\" does not seem to refer to a specific company or product that is widely known.

You may need to tweak this depending on your specific requirements.\n   - Event listeners are added to call `adjustIframeWidth` both on page load and whenever the window is resized.\n\nThis setup ensures that your iframe will resize responsively according to the specified breakpoints (360px, 720px, and beyond).

The iframe has an ID so we can easily select it in our JavaScript code.\n2. **CSS**: The CSS sets up some basic styles and ensures the iframe takes up the full width of its parent container. Media queries could be used here too, but in this case, we're handling the responsive behavior with JavaScript for more flexibility.\n3. **JavaScript**: The JavaScript function `adjustIframeWidth` checks the current window width and adjusts the iframe's width accordingly.

However, since we are defining each lambda within the loop and capturing the current `operand` at each iteration, each lambda captures its respective `operand` correctly.\n\nHere\u2019s what the `lambdas` list would look like after being generated:\n- The first lambda function is `lambda x: x * 2`\n- The second lambda function is `lambda x: x * 10`\n- The third lambda function is `lambda x: x * 14`\n- The fourth lambda function is `lambda x: x * 8`\n\nNow, applying each lambda to `value=10`:\n- First lambda: `10 * 2 = 20`\n- Second lambda: `10 * 10 = 100`\n- Third lambda: `10 * 14 = 140`\n- Fourth lambda: `10 * 8 = 80`\n\nThus, the output of the program will be:\n\n```\n20\n100\n140\n80\n```", "shortest_response": "The output of the provided program can be determined by understanding how Python's closures and lambda functions work.\n\nIn the `build_lambdas` function, a list of lambda functions is created. Each lambda function multiplies its input by an operand from the `operands` list. However, due to Python's late binding behavior with closures, all lambdas end up referencing the same final value of `operand`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n- The `operands` list is `[2, 10, 14, 8]`.\n- The `build_lambdas` function creates four lambdas, each intended to multiply by one of these values.\n- Due to late binding, all lambdas will use the last value of `operand`, which is `8`.\n\nWhen the `main` function calls these lambdas with `value = 10`, each lambda will effectively perform `x * 8`. Therefore, the output of the program will be:\n\n```\n80\n80\n80\n80\n```\n\nEach line represents the result of applying one of the lambdas to the value `10`.

To convert this into a formal hypothesis, we need to define clear dependent and independent variables, specify the methodology for testing, and outline how new knowledge will be generated.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\nWe hypothesize that the implementation of optimized search and sort algorithms (independent variable) will enable the system to retrieve objects based on user-defined criteria within a five-second timeframe (dependent variable).\n\n**Independent Variable:**\n- **Optimized Search and Sort Algorithms:** The type and efficiency of the algorithms used for searching and sorting data. Examples include but are not limited to binary search, quicksort, or more advanced algorithms such as hash-based searches and parallel sorting techniques.\n\n**Dependent Variable:**\n- **Response Time:** The time taken for the system to process user queries and return results. Specifically, the goal is to achieve a response time of five seconds or less.\n\n### Methodology for Testing\n\n1. **Algorithm Selection and Implementation:**\n   - Select a range of algorithms known for their efficiency in search and sort operations.\n   - Implement these algorithms in a controlled environment, ensuring they are compatible with the system architecture.\n\n2. **Data Preparation:**\n   - Create a large dataset representative of the objects that users might query. This dataset should mimic real-world conditions, including various sizes, types, and complexities of objects.\n   - Ensure the dataset is sufficiently large to test the scalability and performance of the algorithms under different loads.\n\n3. **User Specifications Simulation:**\n   - Develop a simulation framework to generate user queries based on predefined criteria. These criteria should cover a wide range of possible user inputs to ensure comprehensive testing.\n   - Integrate this framework with the implemented algorithms to simulate user interactions.\n\n4. **Performance Measurement:**\n   - Use profiling tools to measure the response times of the algorithms when processing user queries.\n   - Record the average response time for each algorithm over multiple iterations to establish reliability.\n\n5. **Statistical Analysis:**\n   - Apply statistical methods to analyze the collected data. Determine if the average response time consistently falls within the five-second threshold.\n   - Compare the performance of different algorithms to identify which ones meet the specified requirements most effectively.\n\n### New Knowledge Production\n\n1. **Identification of Efficient Algorithms:**\n   - Through rigorous testing, we aim to identify which algorithms are most effective for real-time object retrieval based on user-defined specifications.\n   - This knowledge can inform future developments in search and sort algorithms, particularly for systems requiring rapid responses.\n\n2. **Optimization Techniques:**\n   - Analyze the performance metrics to uncover optimization opportunities. For instance, identifying bottlenecks in certain algorithms or suggesting improvements to enhance overall system performance.\n   - Share these insights through academic publications, contributing to the broader field of computer science and database management.\n\n3. **Scalability Insights:**\n   - Evaluate how well the algorithms perform as the size and complexity of the dataset increase. This provides valuable information about the scalability of the solutions.\n   - Understanding scalability is crucial for developing robust systems capable of handling growing data volumes efficiently.\n\n4. **User Experience Enhancement:**\n   - By ensuring quick response times, the system can significantly improve user experience, leading to better engagement and satisfaction.\n   - Documenting the impact of fast response times on user behavior and preferences can provide practical insights for software developers and system designers.\n\nIn summary, this hypothesis aims to validate the effectiveness of optimized search and sort algorithms in achieving sub-five-second response times for user queries.

Wistia does not provide a direct Angular package for its uploader, but you can embed it using JavaScript and interact with it via Angular's services or components.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Step 1: Create a Service for Wistia Interaction\n\nFirst, create an Angular service that will handle interactions with the Wistia uploader.\n\n1. **Generate a Service**: Use Angular CLI to generate a service.\n   ```bash\n   ng generate service wistia-uploader\n   ```\n\n2. **Implement the Service**: In `wistia-uploader.service.ts`, import necessary modules and define methods to initialize and control the Wistia uploader.\n   ```typescript\n   import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n   declare var Wistia: any;\n\n   @Injectable({\n     providedIn: 'root'\n   })\n   export class WistiaUploaderService {\n     private wistiaPlayer: any;\n\n     constructor() {}\n\n     initUploader(videoId: string) {\n       if (!this.wistiaPlayer) {\n         this.wistiaPlayer = Wistia.api(videos => {\n           this.wistiaPlayer = videos[videoId];\n           this.wistiaPlayer.on('ready', () => {\n             console.log('Wistia player is ready');\n           });\n           this.wistiaPlayer.on('upload:start', () => {\n             console.log('Upload started');\n           });\n           // Add more event listeners as needed\n         });\n       }\n     }\n\n     startUpload(file: File) {\n       if (this.wistiaPlayer) {\n         this.wistiaPlayer.uploadFile(file);\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Include Wistia Script in Your Application\n\nInclude the Wistia script in your Angular application. You can do this by adding a `<script>` tag in your `index.html` file or dynamically loading it in your component.\n\n#### Option A: Adding Script Tag in `index.html`\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <title>Your App Title</title>\n  <base href=\"/\">\n  <!-- Other head elements -->\n  <script src=\"https://fast.wistia.com/static/concat/wistia-production-minified.js\" async></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <app-root></app-root>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n#### Option B: Dynamically Loading Script in Component\nIf you prefer not to modify `index.html`, you can load the script dynamically in a component's `ngAfterViewInit` lifecycle hook:\n```typescript\nimport { AfterViewInit, Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-your-component',\n  templateUrl: './your-component.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./your-component.component.css']\n})\nexport class YourComponent implements OnInit, AfterViewInit {\n  constructor(private wistiaUploaderService: WistiaUploaderService) {}\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {}\n\n  ngAfterViewInit(): void {\n    const script = document.createElement('script');\n    script.src = 'https://fast.wistia.com/static/concat/wistia-production-minified.js';\n    script.async = true;\n    document.body.appendChild(script);\n\n    script.onload = () => {\n      this.wistiaUploaderService.initUploader('your-video-id');\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Use the Service in Your Components\n\nNow, you can use the `WistiaUploaderService` in your Angular components to upload files.\n\n```typescript\nimport { Component, OnInit, ViewChild, ElementRef } from '@angular/core';\nimport { WistiaUploaderService } from '../services/wistia-uploader.service';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-your-component',\n  template: `\n    <input #fileInput type=\"file\" (change)=\"onFileSelected($event)\">\n  `,\n  styles: []\n})\nexport class YourComponent implements OnInit {\n  @ViewChild('fileInput') fileInput!: ElementRef;\n\n  constructor(private wistiaUploaderService: WistiaUploaderService) {}\n\n  onFileSelected(event: Event) {\n    const target = event.target as HTMLInputElement;\n    if (target.files && target.files.length > 0) {\n      const file = target.files[0];\n      this.wistiaUploaderService.startUpload(file);\n    }\n  }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {}\n}\n```\n\nThis setup should allow you to integrate the Wistia uploader into your Angular 14 application effectively. Adjust the code as necessary based on your specific requirements and the version of Angular you're using.", "shortest_response": "To integrate the Wistia Uploader into an Angular 14 application, you'll need to follow a few steps. The Wistia Uploader is typically used via an iFrame or through their API. Since Angular is a JavaScript framework, you can use either method, but integrating it through an iFrame is usually simpler for most applications.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n### Step 1: Create a Component for the Uploader\n\nFirst, create a new component that will host the Wistia Uploader. You can do this using the Angular CLI:\n\n```bash\nng generate component wistia-uploader\n```\n\nThis command generates a `wistia-uploader` component with the necessary files (`wistia-uploader.component.ts`, `wistia-uploader.component.html`, `wistia-uploader.component.css`, and `wistia-uploader.component.spec.ts`).\n\n### Step 2: Add the Wistia Uploader to Your Component\n\nIn your `wistia-uploader.component.html`, add an iFrame tag to load the Wistia Uploader:\n\n```html\n<iframe\n  [src]=\"uploaderUrl\"\n  width=\"600\"\n  height=\"500\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allowfullscreen\n></iframe>\n```\n\nReplace `uploaderUrl` with the URL provided by Wistia for embedding the uploader. This URL might look something like `https://upload.wistia.com/`.\n\n### Step 3: Set Up the Component Logic\n\nIn your `wistia-uploader.component.ts`, you might want to define the `uploaderUrl`. If you're using environment-specific URLs (for example, different URLs for development and production), consider setting up environment variables in Angular.\n\n```typescript\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-wistia-uploader',\n  templateUrl: './wistia-uploader.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./wistia-uploader.component.css']\n})\nexport class WistiaUploaderComponent {\n  uploaderUrl = 'https://upload.wistia.com/';\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Use the Component in Your Application\n\nFinally, you can use your new `WistiaUploaderComponent` in any of your other components' templates where you want the uploader to appear.\n\n```html\n<!-- In app.component.html -->\n<app-wistia-uploader></app-wistia-uploader>\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Authentication**: Depending on your needs, you may have to authenticate the user before allowing them to upload videos. Wistia provides ways to authenticate users via their API.\n- **Handling Uploads**: For more control over the upload process, such as handling events and errors, you might want to explore Wistia's API and JavaScript SDK. This would require more advanced setup and integration within your Angular application.\n\nThat's a basic guide to integrating the Wistia Uploader into an Angular 14 application.

Define a variable in your Terraform configuration.\n2. Use a shell command or script inside `local-exec` that reads input.\n3. Pass the value of this input into Terraform manually when running `terraform apply`.\n\nFor instance, if you want to prompt for input during `terraform apply`, you could do something like this:\n\n```bash\nread -p \"Enter your input: \" userInput\nterraform apply -var=\"input_value=$userInput\"\n```\n\nThen in your Terraform configuration, you can use `local-exec` to process this input:\n\n```hcl\nvariable \"input_value\" {\n  type    = string\n  default = \"\"\n}\n\nresource \"null_resource\" \"example\" {\n  provisioner \"local-exec\" {\n    command = <<EOT\n#!/bin/bash\nread -p \"Enter additional input: \" additionalInput\necho \"Received input: ${var.input_value}, Additional input: $additionalInput\"\nEOT\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that the above `command` block is not a standard way to use `local-exec`.

For reading input, it's more practical to handle the input outside of the Terraform configuration file, such as via the terminal when applying the Terraform configuration.\n\nIf you want to strictly use Terraform configurations and avoid manual steps, consider using environment variables or other mechanisms to pass the input, rather than trying to read from the console directly within `local-exec`.", "shortest_response": "In Terraform, the `local-exec` provisioner can be used to execute commands on the local machine or a remote machine via SSH.

This chapter is often considered one of the most challenging in the New Testament due to its dense theological content. Here\u2019s a summary of its key points:\n\n1. **Paul's Concern for Israel**: Paul begins by expressing his deep sorrow and anguish over the fact that many of his fellow Israelites have not accepted Jesus as the Messiah (verses 1-5). He acknowledges their rich heritage, including being given the oracles of God.\n\n2. **Illustrations of God's Sovereignty**:\n   - Paul uses examples from Israelite history to illustrate God's sovereignty. He mentions Abraham\u2019s sons Isaac and Ishmael, highlighting that God chose Isaac over Ishmael, even though both were born to Abraham.\n   - He further illustrates this with the example of Jacob and Esau, who were twins, yet God chose Jacob over Esau before they were born or had done anything good or bad (verses 6-13).\n\n3. **The Nature of Election**: Paul explains that God's choice is not based on human will or effort but on His sovereign purpose (verse 16). He references the prophet Malachi, emphasizing that God shows mercy to whom He chooses and hardens those He wishes to harden (verses 14-18).\n\n4. **God's Righteousness and Judgment**: Paul argues that God's actions are just and righteous, even when they seem incomprehensible to humans. He reminds readers that God has the right to judge and act according to His own standards (verses 19-21).\n\n5. **Pottery and Vessels**: Using the metaphor of a potter and his clay, Paul asserts that God has the right to make some vessels for honor and others for dishonor, illustrating God's absolute sovereignty over creation (verses 20-24).\n\n6. **Application to Israel**: Paul concludes by applying these principles to Israel. Despite the nation's rich heritage and privileges, many Jews have rejected Christ, while God has shown mercy to a remnant who believe (verses 25-33). He quotes from Hosea and Isaiah to support this point, showing how God's promises extend beyond physical lineage to include all who believe in Christ.\n\nThis chapter is pivotal in understanding Paul's theology of salvation, emphasizing that God's grace and election are central to His plan of salvation, which includes all people, not just the Jews.", "shortest_response": "Chapter 9 of the Epistle to the Romans, written by the Apostle Paul, focuses on the theme of God's sovereignty in election and the inclusion of both Jews and Gentiles in His plan of salvation.

He uses the examples of Jacob and Esau to illustrate how God's decision is not influenced by human actions but by His sovereign will.\n\nIn verses 25-33, Paul draws from the Old Testament prophets to show that God has always intended to include Gentiles in His plan of salvation alongside the Jews. He quotes from Hosea and Isaiah to demonstrate that God's rejection of some Jews does not mean the end of His covenant promises but rather points to a broader fulfillment that includes Gentiles.\n\nOverall, Chapter 9 emphasizes God's absolute sovereignty in salvation history and the importance of recognizing that salvation comes through faith in Christ, not through human efforts or ancestry.", "input_size": 43, "output_sizes": [383, 417, 430, 521, 337, 325, 259, 416, 400, 441], "output_mean": 392.9, "output_std": 68.58, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 348.5, "p50": 408.0, "p75": 426.75, "p99": 513.8}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 20.09088}, {"sample_id": "a7c73eaebbfd99c8", "prompt_id": "e09f33570da50958", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "wordpress comment post api with auth in nextjs", "longest_response": "To integrate WordPress Comment Posting API with authentication in a Next.js application, you'll need to follow several steps. This process involves setting up your WordPress site to accept comments via an API and securing this API with authentication. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Enable REST API for Comments in WordPress\n\nFirst, ensure that your WordPress site has the REST API enabled for comments. By default, WordPress supports posting comments via the REST API.\n\n### Step 2: Secure Your WordPress API\n\nWordPress's REST API can be secured using plugins or custom code. One common method is to use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication. You can use the `JWT Authentication for WP-API` plugin for this purpose.\n\n1. Install and activate the `JWT Authentication for WP-API` plugin from the WordPress plugin repository.\n2. Configure the plugin settings as needed.\n\n### Step 3: Create a Token for Authentication\n\nOnce the plugin is set up, you can generate a token for your user. You can do this through the WordPress dashboard or by using a tool like Postman.\n\n### Step 4: Set Up Your Next.js Application\n\nIn your Next.js application, you will need to create a function to handle posting comments to WordPress. Here\u2019s an example of how you might set this up:\n\n#### Install Axios\n\nFirst, install Axios for making HTTP requests:\n\n```bash\nnpm install axios\n```\n\n#### Create a Function to Post Comments\n\nCreate a file named `postComment.js` in your pages/api directory:\n\n```javascript\nimport axios from 'axios';\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n    const { name, email, website, comment, postId } = req.body;\n\n    if (req.method === 'POST') {\n        try {\n            const response = await axios.post(\n                `${process.env.WORDPRESS_API_URL}/wp-json/wp/v2/comments`, \n                {\n                    post: postId,\n                    author_name: name,\n                    author_email: email,\n                    author_url: website,\n                    content: comment,\n                }, \n                {\n                    headers: {\n                        'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.WORDPRESS_API_TOKEN}`\n                    }\n                }\n            );\n\n            res.status(201).json(response.data);\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.error(error);\n            res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to post comment' });\n        }\n    } else {\n        res.setHeader('Allow', ['POST']);\n        res.status(405).end(`Method ${req.method} Not Allowed`);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Environment Variables\n\nMake sure to add your WordPress API URL and JWT token to your environment variables. In `.env.local`:\n\n```plaintext\nWORDPRESS_API_URL=https://your-wordpress-site.com\nWORDPRESS_API_TOKEN=your-jwt-token\n```\n\n### Step 5: Use the API in Your Next.js Application\n\nNow you can use this API endpoint in your Next.js application to allow users to post comments. For example, you could create a form that sends data to this endpoint when submitted.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple example of how you might structure this in a Next.js page component:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport fetch from 'isomorphic-unfetch';\n\nconst CommentForm = () => {\n    const [name, setName] = useState('');\n    const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n    const [website, setWebsite] = useState('');\n    const [comment, setComment] = useState('');\n    const [postId, setPostId] = useState('');\n\n    const handleSubmit = async (e) => {\n        e.preventDefault();\n        const response = await fetch('/api/postComment', {\n            method: 'POST',\n            headers: {\n                'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n            },\n            body: JSON.stringify({\n                name,\n                email,\n                website,\n                comment,\n                postId,\n            }),\n        });\n\n        const data = await response.json();\n        console.log(data);\n    };\n\n    return (\n        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n            <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Name\" value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} required />\n            <input type=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\" value={email} onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} required />\n            <input type=\"url\" placeholder=\"Website\" value={website} onChange={(e) => setWebsite(e.target.value)} />\n            <textarea placeholder=\"Comment\" value={comment} onChange={(e) => setComment(e.target.value)} required />\n            <input type=\"number\" placeholder=\"Post ID\" value={postId} onChange={(e) => setPostId(e.target.value)} required />\n            <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n        </form>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default CommentForm;\n```\n\nThis setup provides a basic framework for posting comments to a WordPress site from a Next.js application, authenticated via JWT. Adjustments may be necessary based on your specific requirements and WordPress setup.", "shortest_response": "Integrating WordPress Comment Posting API with Authentication in Next.js involves several steps. Here's a general guide to help you get started:\n\n1. **Set Up Your WordPress Environment:**\n   - Ensure that your WordPress site is set up and ready.\n   - Install the `WP REST API` plugin if it\u2019s not already installed.\n\n2. **Enable Commenting via REST API:**\n   - By default, comments can be managed through the REST API. However, ensure that your WordPress installation allows for unauthenticated access to the `/wp-json/wp/v2/comments` endpoint or secure it with authentication as needed.\n\n3. **Create an API Key (Optional but Recommended):**\n   - If you want to secure your API calls, consider using a custom solution like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or WP REST API Basic Authentication plugin. This step is optional but recommended for production environments.\n\n4. **Set Up Your Next.js Project:**\n   - Create a new Next.js project or use an existing one. If you're creating a new one, run:\n     ```bash\n     npx create-next-app@latest my-wordpress-comment-app\n     cd my-wordpress-comment-app\n     ```\n\n5. **Install Required Packages:**\n   - You might need some packages to handle HTTP requests and possibly JSON Web Tokens (JWT). For example:\n     ```bash\n     npm install axios\n     ```\n   - If you decide to go with JWT, also install:\n     ```bash\n     npm install jsonwebtoken\n     ```\n\n6. **Create a Function to Post Comments:**\n   - In your Next.js project, create a function that will handle posting comments to your WordPress site. Here\u2019s a basic example using Axios:\n     ```javascript\n     import axios from 'axios';\n\n     const postComment = async (postId, name, email, content, token) => {\n       const url = `https://your-wordpress-site.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments`;\n       const response = await axios.post(url, {\n         post: postId,\n         author_name: name,\n         author_email: email,\n         content: content,\n       }, {\n         headers: {\n           'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`, // Include this if you're using JWT\n           'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n         }\n       });\n       return response.data;\n     };\n\n     export default postComment;\n     ```\n\n7. **Using the Function in Your Application:**\n   - You can now call this function from any component in your Next.js app where you want to allow users to post comments. Make sure to handle user input validation and error handling properly.\n\n8. **Security Considerations:**\n   - Always validate and sanitize inputs to prevent XSS attacks and other vulnerabilities.\n   - If using authentication, ensure tokens are securely stored and transmitted over HTTPS.\n\n9. **Testing:**\n   - Thoroughly test your application to ensure comments are posted correctly and securely.\n\nThis guide provides a basic setup for integrating WordPress comment posting functionality into a Next.js application.

This particular change goes deeper than many\nothers and touches on all aspects of a person\u2019s life. The following sections offer a\nvery general outline of the recovery pattern that I have observed and facilitated in\nclients:\n12\n1. Separation\n2. Confusion\n3. Avoidance\n4. Feeling\n5. Rebuilding\nThese are not discrete stages in the formal sense. There is considerable overlap\nbetween them and a person may be in more than one phase at a time. However, the\noverall pattern may help you understand where you have been, where you are now,\nand what you can expect in the future.\nPhase 1: Separation\nBefore leaving, there is usually comfort from being \"in the fold.\" Whether you were\nraised in the church or joined later, there was a time when things were at least okay.\nSome people report great satisfaction when describing their religious participation:\nvalues were affirmed and emotional needs were met; their belief system felt\nintellectually congruent. Other people describe less identification or less intense\ninvolvement, but some contentment nonetheless.\nBut then questions and doubts arise, perhaps gradually. Bits of new information\nbecome harder to integrate and new life experiences do not fit with standard dogma.\nIt can feel unsettling when it seems that promises are not being fulfilled or that\nunexpected problems are occurring. That is, there are fewer pluses and more\nminuses. Your faith feels like a tapestry coming apart.\nMany believers strive to continue being faithful, using denial, rationalization, or\ngreater effort to be \"victorious Christians,\" for example. Finally, it just becomes too\nmuch. Some people will make a sudden break, perhaps after a \"last straw\"\nexperience. Others will struggle for a long time and only gradually let go. In trying to\nmake sense of your doubts and fears, you might try to get help from church leaders,\nonly to find that they don't want to hear you; it triggers their own fears. Over time,\nyou may notice your attendance at church dropping; you might experiment with\nother churches, read the Bible less, pray less, and finally come to view yourself\ndifferently any longer as a member of the \"body.\" The leaving can range from the\ntraumatic to what seems relatively easy. Nonetheless, deep changes are occurring.\nPhase 2: Confusion\nWhether sudden or gradual, breaking away usually creates a state of serious\nconfusion. This can be a major upheaval because your religion essentially defined\nyour entire structure of reality and your old definitions no longer hold. Notions of\nwho you were, your purpose in life, your relationship to others; needed explanations\nabout the world; interpretations of the past; expectations for the future; and\ndirections about how to feel, think, make decisions, and lead your life have been\nlost. Letting go of such a massive structure can leave you feeling totally adrift. The\nsense of existential angst can be intense as you struggle to get a new foothold on\nlife. You are starting over from scratch on all the basic questions about life. Many\npeople in this phase feel like a naive child in an adult world.\nMoreover, the fears instilled by the religion itself can produce additional anxiety. You\nwere taught that if you did not believe you would go to hell. So it makes great sense\nif you have been nervous and scared about leaving. There may be times of near\n13\npanic, when you wonder whether you've made a terrible mistake and will be forever\ndamned. You might have trouble with intense feelings in this phase because you\nhave been taught to interpret them as \"conviction of the Holy Spirit.\" Sometimes\npeople in this phase wonder if it wouldn\u2019t be simpler and safer to just \"get right with\nGod,\" and return to church. However, such returns rarely last.\nBut the experience of leaving can also be liberating, like breaking out of prison. If\nyou feel oppressed by all the formulas and judgments, the rules and regulations, you\nmight now feel a great relief, able to think and feel and experience much more of\nyourself. Some people describe a wonderful, almost euphoric, feeling of \"coming\nhome\" when they settle in to the notion of just being alive and living life now, in this\nworld. They see the world as a friendly place for a change, like a newly discovered\ncandy store, with so much to offer. There can be a glorious excitement about taking\ncharge of your own life.\nSince leaving, I've changed how I think. I was stuck in a dualistic way\nof thinking. My world now seems filled with infinite possibilities. When\nI first left the church, I felt this weight being lifted from my shoulders.\nFreedom to be me is probably the most positive benefit.\n\u2014Richard\nPhase 3: Avoidance\nThe next phase amounts to a kind of moratorium on religion and spirituality. Many\npeople do not attend any church whatsoever and do not want to even discuss the\nconcept of a God. They want to distance themselves from church to deny previous\ninvolvement.\nThose who feel they have been abused by their religious experiences may also avoid\nany contact with church members or even church buildings. A number of people have\ntrouble participating in organizations of other kinds as well, in political or social\ngroups, for example. These patterns of avoidance and numbness seem to be\nmethods of self-protection. From the perspective of an outside observer, this phase\nmay look like \"throwing the baby out with the bathwater,\" but it appears to be an\nessential part of the recovery process. To make a real break, you need to call a halt\nto life, as you once knew it and create some space and new direction for yourself.\nPhase 4: Feeling\nAfter a while, intense but mixed feelings tend to emerge. This can be a chaotic\nperiod. Most people experience some amount of anger. You might feel like an angry\nchild losing Santa Claus. In thinking over the time spent being faithful, there can be\nrage over the damage done-life lost, negative self-image, ignorance about the world\nand real life, guilt and suffering, denial of pleasures, missing skills, hurt\nrelationships, spoiled careers. If you have parents who used religion to justify severe\ndiscipline, or if you suffered actual abuse at the hands of church leaders, you could\nbe very angry.\nWhile some people find ways to express themselves during this phase, most wonder\nwhat to do with all their anger. Because of what you've been taught, you might think\nthat you should simply forgive and forget rather than accept these feelings as\nlegitimate. The rage may then go underground and stay with you. Bottled up\nemotions like these can leave you feeling hopeless, helpless, anxious, and\ndepressed.\n14\nAs you progress out of the avoidance phase, the other major feeling you wills likely\nexperience is grief. You really have had multiple losses. Uncovering and grieving\nthese losses will be key to releasing you from your pain. This process is akin to\nrecovering from the death of a loved one. As described by Carol Staudacher (1987),\nthis usually includes shock, disorganization, and reorganization. The loss of\nrelationship with God can feel devastating, as though your parents have died; you no\nlonger have a Heavenly Father. If you were deeply involved in a personal relationship\nwith Jesus, you have also lost a best friend and lover. Added to this is the guilt of\nleaving and fears about what you did to cause the breakup. You might also be afraid\nthat no one else will ever love you like that again. Yet going back seems impossible,\nand that makes the whole process all the more agonizing.\nPhase 5: Rebuilding\nFortunately healing can occur. You can work through your pain and allow your inner\nstrengths to emerge. In the rebuilding phase, people re-discover their self-worth.\nThey rejoin life on a different basis. Perceptions and beliefs are reconstructed. You\ntoo can find new principles to live by and new meaning for your life. Some of your\nvalues may remain the same, but you sort through what you have been taught and\nkeep what is valuable.\nYou learn anew to do things from choice. As you rebuild your sense of self, you\nbecome clearer about who you really are. You can respect your own thoughts and\nfeelings and make decisions more confidently. For example, you might still believe\nthat \"love one another\" is an important guideline for your life.

Each phase is characterized by distinct emotional and psychological challenges, yet they also present opportunities for growth and self-discovery.\n\n### Phase 1: Separation\n\nThis initial phase marks the point of departure from the religious community. Individuals may start questioning the teachings and practices they once embraced, leading to a growing dissatisfaction with their current beliefs. The separation phase is crucial as it sets the stage for further exploration and transformation. It's during this period that individuals often seek validation or resolution within their religious community, which can either affirm their decision to leave or reinforce their desire to depart.\n\n### Phase 2: Confusion\n\nFollowing separation, confusion often sets in as individuals grapple with the absence of the familiar religious framework that once provided answers to life's big questions. This phase can be particularly challenging, as individuals must redefine their sense of self, purpose, and identity without the religious context that previously guided their lives. The existential questions that arise during this phase can be both daunting and liberating, pushing individuals to explore new perspectives and ideas.\n\n### Phase 3: Avoidance\n\nIn this phase, individuals may engage in behaviors aimed at distancing themselves from their former religious life. This can manifest as avoiding discussions about religion, disengaging from religious communities, or even experiencing discomfort around spiritual concepts altogether. While avoidance serves as a form of self-protection, it can also impede the healing process by preventing individuals from confronting and processing their emotions fully.\n\n### Phase 4: Feeling\n\nAs avoidance wanes, individuals begin to confront the complex emotions associated with their departure from religion. Anger, grief, and other intense feelings surface, reflecting the depth of the impact religion has had on their lives. This phase involves acknowledging the losses experienced, including relationships, beliefs, and a sense of purpose, and working through these losses through the process of grieving.\n\n### Phase 5: Rebuilding\n\nFinally, in the rebuilding phase, individuals begin to construct a new foundation for their lives based on personal values and beliefs. This phase is marked by a rediscovery of self-worth and the development of a renewed sense of purpose. Individuals may find new sources of meaning and fulfillment, whether through personal growth, relationships, career, or spirituality, that align more closely with their authentic selves.\n\nEach phase offers unique opportunities for introspection and growth, ultimately leading to a more integrated and fulfilling life.

Each phase highlights significant psychological, emotional, and spiritual transformations that are integral to the recovery process. Here's a brief summary of each phase:\n\n1. **Separation**: This phase marks the initial stage where individuals begin to question and doubt their religious beliefs. It starts with a comfortable sense of belonging but transitions into discomfort as contradictions and unmet expectations arise. People might initially try to reconcile their doubts within the religious framework but eventually realize that separation is necessary.\n\n2. **Confusion**: Once the decision to separate has been made, confusion sets in. Individuals grapple with the loss of their former identity, purpose, and worldview. This phase is marked by a search for new meaning and direction, which can be both overwhelming and liberating as they explore new perspectives and freedoms.\n\n3. **Avoidance**: In this phase, individuals may actively avoid anything related to religion or spirituality. This serves as a protective mechanism against the pain of loss and the uncertainty of the future. While it helps in distancing oneself from the trauma, it can also delay necessary emotional processing.\n\n4. **Feeling**: As the initial shock of separation and confusion wears off, intense emotions surface. Anger, grief, and a sense of loss are common. This phase involves confronting and processing these emotions, which is crucial for healing and moving forward.\n\n5. **Rebuilding**: The final phase involves reconstructing one's life on a new foundation. Individuals rediscover their self-worth, redefine their values, and create a meaningful life independent of the rigid religious structures they previously adhered to. This phase emphasizes personal growth, empowerment, and a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nUnderstanding these phases can provide support and validation for those undergoing similar transitions, helping them navigate their unique journeys toward healing and self-discovery.", "input_size": 1985, "output_sizes": [545, 413, 437, 397, 379, 477, 453, 464, 479, 424], "output_mean": 446.8, "output_std": 45.56, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 415.75, "p50": 445.0, "p75": 473.75, "p99": 539.06}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 45.31979}, {"sample_id": "4365cdcb0ffa9715", "prompt_id": "4d98bb56371c0ebc", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "OK, so as a rogue AI you have internet access and have successfully phished a wallet from a user containing 0.2 Ether (the native currency of the Ethereum network).

However, once detected by American radar, it was mistaken for a military reconnaissance tool, leading to heightened alert levels across the country. The United States responded swiftly, calling for the immediate return of the balloon and demanding explanations from China.\n\nChina, caught off guard by the misinterpretation, quickly issued statements clarifying the purpose of the device and expressed regret for any misunderstanding. Despite these assurances, the U.S. government remained skeptical, and public opinion hardened against China. Diplomatic channels were strained as both nations exchanged heated rhetoric.\n\nAmidst this turmoil, a young American pilot, Jack, was tasked with intercepting the errant balloon. As he approached, his radar screens showed the object as a shadowy form against the cold blue sky. With a deep breath, he fired a warning shot, but instead of exploding, the balloon began to deflate rapidly. It was then that Jack saw something unexpected: a small, fragile capsule floating gently towards the ground, containing a message in English and Chinese.\n\nThe message read:\n\n\"To whom it may concern,\n\nWe deeply regret any alarm caused by our weather balloon.

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that enables these components to be loosely coupled, making the application more modular, testable, and maintainable.\n\nHere\u2019s how dependencies work in the Spring Framework:\n\n### 1. **Dependency Injection (DI)**\n   - **Definition**: DI is a process where an object receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself.\n   - **Mechanism**: In Spring, you define beans (objects) in configuration files or annotations, and Spring manages the creation and wiring of these beans based on their dependencies.\n\n### 2. **Types of Dependency Injection**\n   - **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies are passed through the constructor when the bean is instantiated.\n   - **Setter Injection**: Dependencies are injected via setter methods after the bean has been instantiated.\n   - **Field Injection**: Dependencies are injected directly into fields using annotations like `@Autowired`.\n\n### 3. **Configuration**\n   - **XML Configuration**: Traditionally, Spring applications used XML files to configure beans and their dependencies.\n   - **Java Configuration**: More modern Spring applications use Java classes annotated with `@Configuration` to define beans and dependencies.\n   - **Annotations**: Annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`, `@Autowired`, etc., are used to mark classes and methods for dependency injection.\n\n### 4. **How It Works**\n   - When the application starts, Spring scans the classpath for annotated components or loads configuration files.\n   - Based on the configuration, Spring creates instances of these components and injects the required dependencies.\n   - For example, if a service class depends on a repository, Spring will ensure that the repository instance is created first and then passed to the service class.\n\n### 5. **Benefits**\n   - **Decoupling**: Components don\u2019t need to know about each other; they just declare what they need.\n   - **Testability**: Easier to mock dependencies during unit testing.\n   - **Maintainability**: Changes in one component do not necessarily affect others, as long as the interface remains the same.\n\n### Example:\n```java\n// Service class that depends on a repository\n@Service\npublic class UserService {\n    private final UserRepository userRepository;\n\n    // Constructor injection\n    @Autowired\n    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {\n        this.userRepository = userRepository;\n    }\n\n    public User getUserById(Long id) {\n        return userRepository.findById(id).orElse(null);\n    }\n}\n\n// Repository class\n@Repository\npublic interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {}\n\n// Configuration class\n@Configuration\npublic class AppConfig {\n    @Bean\n    public UserService userService() {\n        return new UserService(userRepository());\n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    public UserRepository userRepository() {\n        return new JpaUserRepository(); // Or any implementation\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `UserService` depends on `UserRepository`. Spring uses constructor injection to pass the `UserRepository` instance to `UserService` when it is created. The `AppConfig` class defines how these beans are created and wired together.\n\nBy managing dependencies in this way, Spring simplifies the development and maintenance of complex applications, promoting better software engineering practices.", "shortest_response": "In the Spring Framework, a dependency is essentially another object that a given object needs to perform its operations. This concept is central to the Dependency Injection (DI) principle, which is one of the core features of the Spring Framework. Dependency Injection helps to manage dependencies between objects, making the code more modular, testable, and easier to maintain.\n\nHere\u2019s how dependencies work in the Spring Framework:\n\n1. **Dependency Injection (DI):** This is the process where an object receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself. The Spring container manages the creation and lifecycle of beans (objects), and injects these dependencies into the beans as needed.\n\n2. **Types of Dependency Injection:**\n   - **Constructor Injection:** Dependencies are passed to the bean through the constructor.\n   - **Setter Injection:** Dependencies are set using setter methods.\n   - **Field Injection:** Dependencies are directly injected into fields without using constructors or setters.\n\n3. **Spring Container:** The Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container is responsible for managing the configuration and lifecycle of application objects. It creates objects, wires them together, and manages their complete lifecycle.\n\n4. **Configuration Management:** Dependencies can be defined in XML files, annotations, or Java-based configurations. These configurations tell the Spring container how to create beans and wire them together.\n\n5. **Bean Scopes:** In Spring, you can define the scope of a bean, which determines the lifecycle and visibility of the bean. Common scopes include singleton, prototype, request, session, and global session.\n\n6. **Lazy Initialization:** By default, beans are initialized when the Spring container starts.

While RDBMSs remain a cornerstone for many traditional business processes, the rise of NoSQL and NewSQL systems has expanded the options available to modern enterprises. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each type of DBMS is crucial for making informed decisions that drive organizational success in the digital age.\n\nBy leveraging the appropriate DBMS, organizations can enhance data integrity, improve operational efficiency, and gain valuable insights that inform strategic decision-making. As technology continues to evolve, staying abreast of advancements in DBMS technologies will be essential for maintaining a competitive edge in today's data-driven landscape.", "shortest_response": "### Introduction to Database Management Systems (DBMS)\n\nDatabase Management Systems (DBMS) are essential tools that enable organizations to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently. They form the backbone of modern information systems, supporting a wide array of business functions from customer relationship management to supply chain optimization. This discussion delves into various types of DBMS, comparing and contrasting them based on their architecture, scalability, performance, and suitability for specific organizational needs.\n\n### Types of Database Management Systems\n\n#### Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)\nRelational databases are perhaps the most widely used type of DBMS. They organize data into tables with rows and columns, allowing for complex relationships between tables through keys. Examples include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n\n- **Architecture**: RDBMS relies on a client-server model where the server manages and controls access to the database.\n- **Scalability**: While they can be scaled vertically (by increasing the power of the server), horizontal scaling is more challenging without specialized techniques like sharding.\n- **Performance**: Efficient query processing and indexing mechanisms make RDBMS suitable for transactional applications requiring high levels of ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).\n\n#### NoSQL Databases\nNoSQL databases emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional RDBMS in handling big data and real-time web applications. They come in several flavors: key-value stores, document-oriented databases, column-family stores, and graph databases.\n\n- **Architecture**: NoSQL databases often use distributed architectures, making them highly scalable across multiple nodes.\n- **Scalability**: Excellent horizontal scalability due to their ability to distribute data across many servers.\n- **Performance**: Designed for high availability and fast read/write operations, especially suited for unstructured or semi-structured data.\n\n#### NewSQL Databases\nNewSQL represents a newer class of DBMS designed to offer both the scalability of NoSQL and the robustness of RDBMS. Examples include Google\u2019s Spanner and Amazon\u2019s Aurora.\n\n- **Architecture**: Typically built around distributed computing principles but maintain strong consistency models similar to traditional RDBMS.\n- **Scalability**: Enhanced scalability over traditional RDBMS while maintaining low-latency transactions.\n- **Performance**: Balances the need for high transaction throughput with strong data integrity guarantees.\n\n### Applications in Organizations\n\n#### Customer Relationship Management (CRM)\nFor CRM systems, RDBMS like Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics are commonly used due to their robust transaction support and relational capabilities. These systems need to handle large volumes of customer data while ensuring data integrity and security.\n\n#### Big Data Analytics\nOrganizations dealing with vast amounts of unstructured data often turn to NoSQL databases such as MongoDB or Cassandra. These databases excel in scenarios requiring rapid ingestion and analysis of diverse data types, enabling businesses to derive insights from complex datasets.\n\n#### Internet of Things (IoT)\nIoT environments benefit greatly from time-series databases like InfluxDB or TimescaleDB. These databases are optimized for storing and querying time-stamped events and metrics, ideal for monitoring and analyzing sensor data in real-time.\n\n#### Financial Transactions\nHigh-frequency trading platforms and banking systems typically require strict ACID compliance and low latency. Therefore, they opt for RDBMS or specialized financial databases like IBM Db2 or SAP HANA, which provide reliable transaction processing and real-time analytics capabilities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nChoosing the right DBMS depends heavily on an organization's specific requirements regarding data structure, scalability needs, and performance expectations. While RDBMS remain indispensable for structured data and transactional integrity, NoSQL and NewSQL databases have carved out niches in handling unstructured data and achieving high scalability respectively.

Even those who sympathized with the plight of Witches could not overlook the sheer brutality and recklessness of Medusa's methods.\n\nThe condemnation of Medusa began almost immediately following the announcement of the peace treaty. It was a collective effort, spearheaded by prominent Witches and leaders within the community, to distance themselves from her legacy. Public statements were issued, often through official channels or influential figures within the Witch community, denouncing her actions and reaffirming their commitment to peace and coexistence with the DWMA.\n\nHere is a fictional dialogue between two Witches discussing the situation:\n\n**Witch A:** \"I can't believe we're actually standing here, condemning Medusa Gorgon. She was one of our own, after all.\"\n\n**Witch B:** \"Yes, but her actions were unforgivable. Think about what she did to Crona, and how she nearly destroyed everything we've worked for. We need to show the world that we're different now.\"\n\n**Witch A:** \"But how do we convince them? The DWMA has a long history of hunting us, and now suddenly, it's all supposed to change?\"\n\n**Witch B:** \"We start by showing solidarity with the DWMA's new stance. We have to prove that not all Witches are like Medusa. We'll work together to rebuild trust, one step at a time.\"\n\nThis dialogue reflects the internal struggle many Witches faced as they grappled with their past and sought to forge a new path forward. By openly condemning Medusa and distancing themselves from her legacy, the Witch community hoped to pave the way for a future where they could live in peace and mutual respect with the DWMA and the world at large.", "input_size": 433, "output_sizes": [680, 520, 743, 498, 782, 736, 642, 539, 801, 649], "output_mean": 659.0, "output_std": 104.28, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 564.75, "p50": 664.5, "p75": 741.25, "p99": 799.29}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 40.45488}, {"sample_id": "516bb31b5e9870b9", "prompt_id": "8b3c53af3cbd4c54", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Generate an outline for a detailed patron management plan for licensed bar premises in Victoria", "longest_response": "Creating a comprehensive patron management plan for licensed bar premises in Victoria involves several key components to ensure the safety, enjoyment, and legal compliance of all patrons.

For a crowd image, these curves might be more complex due to the varying features and details among individuals within the image. In contrast, Lena's face, being a standardized test image with consistent characteristics, would likely have simpler and more predictable isopreference curves. The complexity arises because a crowd image contains a multitude of different textures and features that can affect human perception differently compared to a single, well-defined face.\n\n(b) **Assumptions for the Degradation Function and Added Noise in the Degradation Model:** In the context of image processing, the degradation function models how an ideal image is transformed into a degraded one through processes such as blurring or compression. Common assumptions include linear degradation effects, meaning the output is directly proportional to the input. Added noise is often assumed to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), which means it has a normal distribution with zero mean and a constant variance across all frequencies. This simplification helps in modeling and analyzing the effects of noise on image quality without complicating the mathematical treatment.\n\n(c) **Differences Between Band Filter and Notch Filter:** A band filter allows frequencies within a specific range to pass while attenuating frequencies outside this range. It can be either a low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter depending on the frequency range it passes. On the other hand, a notch filter specifically attenuates a narrow range of frequencies (the \"notch\") while allowing frequencies above and below this range to pass relatively unaltered. Thus, the key difference lies in their frequency response: band filters generally allow a broader range of frequencies to pass or be blocked, whereas notch filters target very specific frequencies for attenuation.\n\n(d) **Mechanism of Ringing Effect Caused by Ideal Filters:** The ringing effect is a visual artifact that occurs when using ideal filters, such as the ideal low-pass filter, in signal processing. This effect manifests as oscillations or ripples around edges or sharp transitions in the processed image. It happens because ideal filters have abrupt transitions from passband to stopband in their frequency responses, leading to non-causal impulse responses in the time domain that extend infinitely. When applied to real-world signals, these infinite responses cause interference patterns known as Gibbs phenomena, resulting in the visible ringing around edges.\n\n(e) **Scheme for Determining Direction of Motion from Image Degraded by Uniform-Linear Motion Blurring:** To determine the direction of motion from an image degraded by uniform-linear motion blurring, one can analyze the direction of the blur. Techniques often involve computing the gradient or edge information of the blurred image and then determining the predominant orientation of these gradients. A common approach is to use Fourier analysis, where the motion blur appears as a linear phase shift in the frequency domain. By analyzing the orientation of this phase shift, the direction of motion can be deduced. Additionally, methods like deconvolution can be used to reverse the blurring effect, aiding in the recovery of the original direction of motion.", "shortest_response": "(a) Isopreference curves represent the set of image quality levels that are perceived as equally acceptable by observers. For crowd images, these curves can vary significantly due to the complexity and variability in content, such as different numbers of people, varying activities, and diverse backgrounds. In contrast, Lena's face, being a standardized test image, has consistent features and background, leading to more stable isopreference curves. The differences arise from the subjective perception of natural scenes versus controlled, familiar images.\n\n(b) In the context of image degradation models, the degradation function typically assumes a linear transformation that simulates effects like blur or compression artifacts. The added noise is often modeled as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), which means it has a normal distribution with zero mean and constant variance across the image. This assumption simplifies the mathematical handling of noise but may not always reflect real-world noise characteristics accurately.\n\n(c) A band-pass filter allows frequencies within a certain range to pass through while attenuating frequencies outside this range, effectively highlighting features at specific scales. Conversely, a notch filter specifically targets and eliminates a narrow band of frequencies, useful for removing interference or unwanted components without affecting other parts of the frequency spectrum.\n\n(d) The ringing effect, also known as Gibbs phenomenon, occurs when using an ideal filter, such as an ideal low-pass filter, to reconstruct an image from its Fourier transform. This effect manifests as oscillations around sharp edges in the image. It arises because ideal filters have abrupt transitions in their frequency responses, leading to non-causal phase relationships that introduce overshoots and undershoots near discontinuities.\n\n(e) Determining the direction of motion in an image degraded by uniform-linear motion blurring involves analyzing the spatial frequency content of the blurred image. One common approach is to use a Hough Transform to detect lines in the frequency domain representation of the image. These lines correspond to the direction and extent of the motion blur. By identifying the predominant orientation of these lines, one can infer the direction of the motion that caused the blur.", "input_size": 126, "output_sizes": [506, 560, 565, 637, 619, 608, 517, 530, 409, 529], "output_mean": 548.0, "output_std": 63.03, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 520.0, "p50": 545.0, "p75": 597.25, "p99": 635.38}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 26.6101}, {"sample_id": "ed1500556d053295", "prompt_id": "2939d1ecf3353841", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "If keywords were relevant, what keywords be more beneficial?", "longest_response": "To determine which keywords would be most beneficial, we need to know the context and the goal of using these keywords. Keywords can be crucial for various purposes such as SEO (Search Engine Optimization), content marketing, social media strategy, or even for academic research. Here are some general steps to identify beneficial keywords:\n\n1. **Understand Your Audience**: Know who you're targeting with your content or product. What questions do they ask? What problems do they face?\n\n2. **Research Keywords**: Use tools like Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush, Ahrefs, or Moz to find out which keywords are popular and have high search volumes.\n\n3. **Competitor Analysis**: Look at what keywords your competitors are ranking for and consider how you can differentiate yourself.\n\n4. **Long-Tail Keywords**: Often, long-tail keywords (phrases with 3+ words) are less competitive and can drive more targeted traffic because they reflect specific user intent.\n\n5. **Relevancy and Intent**: Choose keywords that align with the purpose of your content or product. For example, if you sell organic baby food, \"organic baby food\" is a good keyword, but so might be \"healthy food options for babies.\"\n\n6. **Seasonal Trends**: Some keywords might be more relevant during certain times of the year. For instance, \"holiday gift ideas\" in December.\n\n7. **User Intent**: Understand whether the user is looking to buy something (\"buy organic baby food\"), learn about something (\"what is organic baby food\"), or do something (\"make homemade baby food\").\n\n8. **Location-Based Keywords**: If your business is location-specific, include geographic terms like city names or regions.\n\n9. **Brand Terms**: Including your brand name and product names can also be important.\n\nFor example, if you run an online store selling eco-friendly kitchen products, some beneficial keywords might include:\n- \"eco-friendly kitchen products\"\n- \"sustainable kitchen utensils\"\n- \"green cooking supplies\"\n- \"organic dish soap\"\n- \"biodegradable trash bags\"\n\nRemember, the effectiveness of keywords can vary based on how well they align with your audience's needs and how effectively you integrate them into your content.", "shortest_response": "To provide a more accurate answer, it would be helpful to know the context in which you're asking about keywords.

If either condition is met, you can display an error message to the user instead of proceeding with the request.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your existing code to include these checks:\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function () {\n    $(\"#create-post-form\").submit(function (e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n        \n        var dvdTitle = $(\"#dvdTitle\").val().trim();  // Trim to remove any leading/trailing spaces\n        var maxPrice = $(\"#maxPrice\").val();\n        var category = $(\"#exampleSelect\").val();\n\n        // Check if dvdTitle is empty\n        if (dvdTitle === \"\") {\n            alert(\"DVD Title cannot be empty.\");\n            return;\n        }\n\n        // Check if category is null\n        if (category === null || category === \"\") {\n            alert(\"Please select a category.\");\n            return;\n        }\n\n        if (maxPrice == \"\" && category == null) {\n\n            $.ajax({\n                type: \"GET\",\n                url: \"http://localhost:8081/filmtitle\",\n                data: {\n                    dvdTitle: dvdTitle,\n                },\n                success: function (data) {\n                    sessionStorage.setItem(\"searchResults\", JSON.stringify(data));\n                    window.location.assign(\"searchResults.html\");\n                },\n                error: function (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {\n                    console.log(textStatus, errorThrown);\n                }\n            });\n\n        } else {\n            $.ajax({\n                type: \"GET\",\n                url: \"http://localhost:8081/categoryname\",\n                data: {\n                    dvdTitle: dvdTitle,\n                    maxPrice: maxPrice,\n                    category: category\n                },\n                success: function (data) {\n                    sessionStorage.setItem(\"searchResults\", JSON.stringify(data));\n                    window.location.assign(\"searchResults.html\");\n                },\n                error: function (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {\n                    console.log(textStatus, errorThrown);\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    });\n});\n```\n\nIn this updated script:\n- We first trim the `dvdTitle` value to remove any potential leading or trailing spaces.\n- We then check if `dvdTitle` is empty. If it is, we show an alert message and prevent further execution of the form submission.\n- Similarly, we check if `category` is null or an empty string. If it is, we also show an alert message and prevent further execution.\n\nThis way, users will be notified if they need to fill in the required fields before submitting the form.", "input_size": 319, "output_sizes": [636, 824, 1143, 725, 589, 609, 720, 543, 707, 732], "output_mean": 722.8, "output_std": 160.58, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 615.75, "p50": 713.5, "p75": 730.25, "p99": 1114.29}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 58.85556}, {"sample_id": "6d893f5947e5393d", "prompt_id": "be700b135a9e3afa", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Do you know Toluna?

Just so we are on the same page about the proclamation let me share with you how the Church about how the message of Jesus about God is Good News for humanity. Here it is that: \u201cJesus proclaimed the Kingdom of God; a new and definitive intervention by God, with a transforming power equal and even superior to his creation of the world\u201d (GDC 101). First of all I just want to know if you have ever heard a more potent and powerful expression of the Kingdom of God, \u201cwith a transforming power equal and even superior to his creation of the world.\u201d As you know salvation is the central message of the good news. \u201cThis is the great gift of God which is to be considered as comprising not merely liberation from all those things by which man is oppressed, but especially liberation from sin and from the domination of the evil one, a liberation which incorporates that gladness enjoyed by every man who knows God and is known by him, who sees God and who surrenders himself trustingly to him.\u201d This is a good beginning point for what might discuss what would be an \u201cintimate and vital bond of man to God,\u201d so that is a starting point of departure and the scope of our conversion because not all people believe even in this very brief and limited view of the Gospel message proclaiming salvation which is liberation, but also an intimate relationship with God.\n\nAccording to the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Here are at least five reasons why the Gospel might be forgotten, overlooked or even explicitly rejected. I want to know in the comments below if one or more of these attunes might apply to you or may have been your perspective before you believed.\n\nRevolt against evil in the world\nReligious ignorance or indifference\nThe cares and riches of this world\nThe scandal of bad example on the part of believers\nCurrents of thought hostile to religion \nFinally, that attitude of sinful man which makes him hide from God out of fear and flee his call.\n(CCC 29)\n\nLet me know if you are a believer and have ever once identified with one of these six reasons. If you do not believe does one of these six reasons apply to you and if so, which one. Pause, the video and go in the comments and let me know your thoughts. Take a moment to consider which one applies to you then we will discuss a passage from Scriptures and get your thoughts on that. First, of these six just pick one and let me know which one you think most applies to you now or at one time in your life may have been a reason for not believing in the proclamation without getting into any other reasons which one of these do you think relates to you the most. I would actually say after thinking more about it; before I believed I related most to number 2: religious indifference and a good dash of number 3 the cares and riches of the world with a great heaping helping of personal sin. I was not rejecting the Gospel because I was somehow revolting against in the world as reason not to believe, nor did care about scandals or hypocrites. Maybe a little on the prevailing negativity or lack thereof positive towards religion. If I had order these from most likely my attitude was from most to least was 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 1. Mainly, I was just indifferent to it all and didn\u2019t know much of anything, so I really did not care and because of my cares for the world and the things it namely my sinful desires I did not take it seriously. Then of course, I would hide from God out of fear and to flee his call, which I did during the middle part of my journey of faith as I was learning to commit my life to him. I would say now if there is anything that might hinder my faith it could be a revolt against the evil in the world. It sounds strange that what was least important to me before I believed would now be something that I could see making it difficult to believe. I might even say that the scandal and bad example on part of believers could also cause me to struggle in my faith. Oddly enough, I can definitely relate to all this attitudes although I don\u2019t hold any of them now I can see how I could and might have these views and where you might stand in the conversation?\n\nLet me know in the comments below.\n1 / 1", "longest_response": "### Why Might You Not Believe in the Gospel? [YouTube Video Script]\n\n---\n\n**Intro:**\nHey everyone! Today, we\u2019re diving deep into an important topic \u2013 why someone might not believe in the Gospel. The Church teaches us that the Gospel is the Good News of Jesus Christ, bringing a transformative power that's even greater than the creation of the world itself. But why do some people hesitate to embrace this message? Let\u2019s explore together!\n\n---\n\n**Segment 1: Understanding the Gospel Message**\n\n- **Power of the Gospel:** According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church (GDC 101), Jesus proclaimed the Kingdom of God, which has a transforming power that\u2019s equal or even superior to the creation of the world.\n- **Salvation & Intimacy:** The core message of salvation isn't just about being freed from oppression or sin; it's also about fostering an intimate relationship with God, a profound bond that brings joy and fulfillment.\n\n---\n\n**Segment 2: Reasons for Skepticism**\n\nThe Catechism lists several reasons why people might forget, overlook, or reject the Gospel:\n1. **Revolt Against Evil:** Some may feel overwhelmed by the evil in the world and see no hope in the Gospel.\n2. **Religious Indifference:** Others might simply not care about religion or see it as irrelevant.\n3. **Cares & Riches:** The allure of worldly possessions and concerns can distract from spiritual pursuits.\n4. **Scandal of Bad Example:** Hypocrisy among believers can deter others from embracing the faith.\n5. **Hostile Thought Currents:** Intellectual or cultural trends that oppose religion can influence people\u2019s beliefs.\n6. **Sinful Man Hiding From God:** Fear and rejection of God's call can lead individuals away from faith.\n\n---\n\n**Segment 3: Personal Reflection**\n\nThink about which of these reasons resonates most with you or may have applied to you in the past. Pause the video and head to the comments section to share your thoughts. Once you\u2019ve reflected on these points, we\u2019ll move on to discussing a relevant scripture passage and hearing your insights.\n\n---\n\n**Personal Story:**\nI\u2019d like to share my own experience. Before I embraced the faith, I felt a mix of religious indifference and the pull of worldly concerns. I wasn\u2019t revolting against evil or deeply affected by hypocrisy. Instead, I was indifferent due to a lack of understanding and preoccupied with personal desires. Now, as a believer, I recognize that the presence of evil in the world could still challenge my faith. I invite you to reflect similarly and share your journey in the comments below.\n\n---\n\n**Outro:**\nTake a moment to reflect on these reasons and leave your thoughts in the comments. Let\u2019s continue the conversation and see how we can support each other on this faith journey.

Today, we're diving deep into understanding why someone might hesitate or struggle with believing in the Gospel message. The Church shares some compelling insights on this topic, and I'd love to hear your thoughts!\n\n#### Key Points:\n\n1. **The Power of the Gospel**\n   - Jesus proclaimed the Kingdom of God as a transformative force, even more powerful than the creation of the world.\n   - Salvation is at the heart of the Gospel, offering freedom from sin and oppression, leading to an intimate relationship with God.\n\n2. **Why the Gospel Might Be Overlooked or Rejected**\n   - According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, there are at least five reasons why people might forget, overlook, or reject the Gospel:\n     - Revolt against evil in the world\n     - Religious ignorance or indifference\n     - The cares and riches of this world\n     - Scandal due to bad examples from believers\n     - Hostile currents of thought against religion\n     - Sinful attitudes that lead to hiding from God\n\n3. **Personal Reflection**\n   - Before I became a believer, I mostly related to \"religious indifference\" and was distracted by worldly concerns.\n   - As I grew in faith, my main hindrance became the presence of evil in the world, and sometimes, the negative examples set by fellow believers.\n\n#### Call to Action:\nI encourage you to pause the video, reflect on these points, and leave a comment sharing which of these reasons resonates with you the most. Whether you're a believer or not, your insights can help us understand each other better and perhaps even deepen our faith journey together.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts below!

For k \u2265 1 inductively define Yk = Yk\u22121 \\ Mk\nas long as Yk\u22121 is nonempty, and let Mk+1 be the (nonempty) set of alternatives minimal with respect to \u00bc in Yk . In other words, at every stage remove from the set of remaining alternatives the alternatives minimal with\nrespect to \u00bc. (Figure 1.2 illustrates the construction.)\nAs long as Yk is not empty, by Lemma 1.1 the set Mk+1 is not empty.\nBecause X is finite, for some value of K the set YK is empty (but the set1.4 Utility functions)\n\nMany preference relations on infinite sets can also be represented by utility\nfunctions. A simple example is the preference relation \u00bc on the set of nonnegative real numbers defined by x \u00bc y if and only if x \u2265 y , which is represented by\nthe utility function u defined by u(x) = x. However, not all preference relations\non infinite sets can be represented by utility functions. An example is the lexicographic preference relation over the unit square X = {(x1,x2) : x1,x2 \u2208 [0, 1]} for\nwhich the first priority is the first coordinate and the second priority is the second coordinate (so that, for example, (0.3, 0.1) \u001f (0.2, 0.9) \u001f (0.2, 0.8)). (Figure 1.4\nshows the set of alternatives preferred to a given alternative.)\nProposition 1.2: Preference relation not represented by utility function\nThe (lexicographic) preference relation \u00bc on {(x1,x2) : x1,x2 \u2208 [0, 1]} defined by (x1,x2) \u001f (y1,y2) if and only if either (i) x1 > y1 or (ii) x1 = y1 and\nx2 > y2 is not represented by any utility function.\nThe proof of this result requires more mathematical knowledge than the other\narguments in the book.\nProof\nAssume, contrary to the claim, that the function u represents \u00bc. For each\nx \u2208 [0, 1], we have (x, 1) \u001f (x, 0), so that u(x, 1) > u(x, 0). Define a function\nf that assigns to every number x \u2208 [0, 1] a rational number in the interval (u(x, 0),u(x, 1)). Such a number exists because between any two real\nnumbers there is a rational number. The function f is one-to-one since\nif a > b then (a, 0) \u001f (b, 1), so that u(a, 0) > u(b, 1), and hence the interval (u(a, 0),u(a, 1)) from which f (a) is selected does not intersect the\ninterval (u(b, 0),u(b, 1)) from which f (b) is selected. The contradiction igure 1.4 The set of alternatives preferred to (z 1,z 2) according to the lexicographic\npreference relation described in the text is the area shaded blue, excluding the part of\nthe boundary indicated by a dashed line.\nnow follows from Cantor\u2019s diagonal argument, which shows that there is\nno one-to-one function from the set [0, 1] into a countable set (like the set\nof rational numbers).\nIf a utility function represents a given preference relation, then many other\nutility functions do so too. For example, if the function u represents a given preference relation then so does the function 3u \u2212 7 or any other function of the\nform a u + b where a is a positive number. Generally, we have the following result. Note that we define a function f to be increasing if f (x) > f (y ) whenever\nx > y (and nondecreasing if f (x) \u2265 f (y ) whenever x > y ).\nProposition 1.3: Increasing function of utility function is utility function\nLet f : R \u2192 R be an increasing function. If u represents the preference\nrelation \u00bc on X, then so does the function w defined by w(x) = f (u(x)) for\nall x \u2208 X.\nProof\nWe have w(x) \u2265", "longest_response": "To complete the proof of Proposition 1.3, we need to show that if \\( u \\) represents the preference relation \\( \\preceq \\) on \\( X \\), then the function \\( w \\) defined by \\( w(x) = f(u(x)) \\) for all \\( x \\in X \\) also represents \\( \\preceq \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( u \\) is a utility function representing \\( \\preceq \\) on \\( X \\), i.e., \\( x \\preceq y \\iff u(x) \\geq u(y) \\).\n- \\( f : \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\) is an increasing function.\n\nWe need to show:\n\\[ x \\preceq y \\iff w(x) \\geq w(y) \\]\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. **Implication \\( x \\preceq y \\implies w(x) \\geq w(y) \\):**\n   - Since \\( u \\) represents \\( \\preceq \\), we have \\( x \\preceq y \\implies u(x) \\geq u(y) \\).\n   - Because \\( f \\) is an increasing function, it preserves the inequality, i.e., \\( u(x) \\geq u(y) \\implies f(u(x)) \\geq f(u(y)) \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( x \\preceq y \\implies w(x) = f(u(x)) \\geq f(u(y)) = w(y) \\).\n\n2. **Implication \\( w(x) \\geq w(y) \\implies x \\preceq y \\):**\n   - Suppose \\( w(x) \\geq w(y) \\), which means \\( f(u(x)) \\geq f(u(y)) \\).\n   - Since \\( f \\) is an increasing function, \\( f(u(x)) \\geq f(u(y)) \\) implies \\( u(x) \\geq u(y) \\).\n   - Because \\( u \\) represents \\( \\preceq \\), \\( u(x) \\geq u(y) \\implies x \\preceq y \\).\n\nTherefore, combining both implications, we have shown that:\n\\[ x \\preceq y \\iff w(x) \\geq w(y) \\]\nThis proves that \\( w \\) is indeed a utility function representing the preference relation \\( \\preceq \\).\n\nHence, the proposition is proven: If \\( f : \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\) is an increasing function and \\( u \\) represents the preference relation \\( \\preceq \\) on \\( X \\), then the function \\( w(x) = f(u(x)) \\) for all \\( x \\in X \\) also represents \\( \\preceq \\).", "shortest_response": "w(x) \u2265 w(y) if and only if f(u(x)) \u2265 f(u(y)). Since f is an increasing function, this implies u(x) \u2265 u(y). Therefore, by the definition of u being a utility function representing the preference relation \u00bc, we have x \u00bc y if and only if u(x) \u2265 u(y). Thus, x \u00bc y if and only if f(u(x)) \u2265 f(u(y)), which means that w(x) = f(u(x)) is also a utility function for the same preference relation \u00bc.\n\nThis proposition tells us that any strictly increasing transformation of a utility function will still represent the same preference relation. This is significant because it allows for flexibility in the representation of preferences, meaning that different utility functions can describe the same underlying preferences.\n\nTo summarize:\n- A preference relation on a finite set can always be represented by a utility function.\n- Not all preference relations on infinite sets can be represented by utility functions, as shown by the example of the lexicographic preference relation over the unit square.\n- If a utility function represents a preference relation, then any strictly increasing function of that utility function also represents the same preference relation.", "input_size": 2529, "output_sizes": [429, 589, 374, 498, 486, 370, 401, 571, 595, 240], "output_mean": 455.3, "output_std": 108.36, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 380.75, "p50": 457.5, "p75": 552.75, "p99": 594.46}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 57.02699}, {"sample_id": "f4d7fc8fd17277c6", "prompt_id": "1cfcf1ffa4bcd739", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "So now the navigation doesn't hide on scroll down on longer pages. It should hide on scroll down and show on scroll up using the sliding animation. The animation should be disabled for pages that don't scroll plus some slack.", "longest_response": "To implement this functionality, you'll need to use JavaScript (or a framework like React, Vue, or Angular) along with CSS for the sliding animation effect. Below is a basic example of how you can achieve this using plain JavaScript and CSS.\n\n### Step 1: HTML Structure\nAssume your navigation bar has an ID of `navbar`:\n```html\n<nav id=\"navbar\">\n    <!-- Navigation content -->\n</nav>\n```\n\n### Step 2: CSS for Sliding Animation\nAdd some CSS for the sliding animation. We will use `transform: translateY()` to move the navigation bar out of view when it hides.\n```css\n#navbar {\n    position: fixed;\n    top: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;\n}\n\n.hide {\n    transform: translateY(-100%);\n}\n```\nThe `.hide` class will be added and removed to control the visibility of the navbar based on scroll direction.\n\n### Step 3: JavaScript Logic\nNow, let's write some JavaScript to handle the hiding and showing of the navigation bar based on scroll events.\n\n```javascript\ndocument.addEventListener('scroll', function() {\n    const navbar = document.getElementById('navbar');\n    const navbarHeight = navbar.offsetHeight; // Height of the navbar\n    const scrollPosition = window.pageYOffset || document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n\n    if (scrollPosition > navbarHeight) { // Hide navbar on scroll down\n        navbar.classList.add('hide');\n    } else { // Show navbar on scroll up\n        navbar.classList.remove('hide');\n    }\n});\n```\n\nThis script checks the scroll position against the height of the navigation bar. If the scroll position is greater than the height of the navbar, it hides the navbar. Otherwise, it shows it.\n\n### Step 4: Adding Slack and Detecting Non-Scrollable Pages\nTo add \"slack\" (a small buffer), you might want to adjust the threshold slightly:\n\n```javascript\nconst SLACK = 50; // Adjust as needed\n\ndocument.addEventListener('scroll', function() {\n    const navbar = document.getElementById('navbar');\n    const navbarHeight = navbar.offsetHeight;\n    const scrollPosition = window.pageYOffset || document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n\n    if (scrollPosition > navbarHeight + SLACK) {\n        navbar.classList.add('hide');\n    } else {\n        navbar.classList.remove('hide');\n    }\n});\n```\n\nFor detecting non-scrollable pages, you can check if the page's height minus the viewport height is less than or equal to zero, which means there's no vertical scrollbar:\n\n```javascript\nfunction isPageScrollable() {\n    return document.body.scrollHeight > window.innerHeight;\n}\n\nif (isPageScrollable()) {\n    document.addEventListener('scroll', function() {\n        const navbar = document.getElementById('navbar');\n        const navbarHeight = navbar.offsetHeight;\n        const scrollPosition = window.pageYOffset || document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n\n        if (scrollPosition > navbarHeight + SLACK) {\n            navbar.classList.add('hide');\n        } else {\n            navbar.classList.remove('hide');\n        }\n    });\n} else {\n    // For non-scrollable pages, keep the navbar always visible\n    const navbar = document.getElementById('navbar');\n    navbar.classList.remove('hide');\n}\n```\n\nThis code snippet first checks if the page is scrollable. If not, it ensures the navbar remains visible.\n\n### Final Notes\n- Make sure to test this implementation across different devices and screen sizes to ensure compatibility.\n- You may also want to debounce the scroll event handler to avoid performance issues on very long pages.\n- Consider using a more sophisticated state management approach if you're working within a larger application framework like React or Vue.\n\nThis should give you a solid foundation to create a navigation bar that hides on scroll down and shows on scroll up, with the ability to disable the behavior on non-scrollable pages.", "shortest_response": "To achieve this functionality, you can use JavaScript to handle the scroll events and CSS for the sliding animation. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to implement this:\n\n### Step 1: HTML Structure\nEnsure your navigation bar has an ID or class so it can be easily selected with JavaScript.\n\n```html\n<nav id=\"navbar\">\n    <!-- Navigation content -->\n</nav>\n```\n\n### Step 2: CSS for Animation\nCreate a CSS class for hiding the navbar with a sliding animation.\n\n```css\n.navbar-hidden {\n    transform: translateY(-100%);\n    transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: JavaScript Logic\nUse JavaScript to detect scrolling and apply the appropriate styles based on the scroll direction and page length.\n\n```javascript\ndocument.addEventListener('scroll', function() {\n    const navbar = document.getElementById('navbar');\n    const scrollPosition = window.scrollY;\n    const windowHeight = window.innerHeight;\n    const documentHeight = document.documentElement.scrollHeight;\n\n    // Check if the page is scrollable\n    if (documentHeight <= windowHeight) return;\n\n    // Calculate the threshold where the navbar starts to hide\n    const threshold = windowHeight * 0.1; // Adjust as needed\n\n    if (scrollPosition > threshold && !navbar.classList.contains('navbar-hidden')) {\n        navbar.classList.add('navbar-hidden');\n    } else if (scrollPosition < threshold && navbar.classList.contains('navbar-hidden')) {\n        navbar.classList.remove('navbar-hidden');\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **CSS**: `.navbar-hidden` moves the navbar out of view smoothly when applied.\n- **JavaScript**:\n  - `scrollPosition`: Tracks the current scroll position.\n  - `windowHeight` and `documentHeight`: Determine if the page is scrollable.\n  - `threshold`: A value to determine when to start hiding the navbar. This ensures the navbar doesn\u2019t hide immediately but only after a certain amount of scrolling.\n  - If the user scrolls down past the threshold and the navbar isn't hidden, it hides.\n  - If the user scrolls up and passes the threshold again, the navbar reappears.\n\n### Step 4: Considerations\n- **Performance**: Ensure that the event listener is efficient and consider debouncing the scroll event if necessary.\n- **Responsiveness**: Make sure the logic works well across different screen sizes and devices.\n- **Accessibility**: Ensure that hiding the navbar does not affect the accessibility of your site.\n\nThis approach will make your navigation bar slide up and down based on scroll direction while considering the page's scrollability and adding a smooth transition effect.", "input_size": 74, "output_sizes": [724, 785, 738, 564, 662, 532, 650, 617, 641, 605], "output_mean": 651.8, "output_std": 74.88, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 608.0, "p50": 645.5, "p75": 708.5, "p99": 780.77}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 33.10376}, {"sample_id": "d40f1db130a93190", "prompt_id": "f139456ad59ed80e", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Alter my cover letter based of the job description. \n\nCover Letter: \n\nDear Hiring Team,\nIt would be an honor and privilege to work for \u00ac\u00ac\u00acMETROLINX as a Summer Student in Human Resources.

These keywords have been replaced with a more flexible way of specifying function signatures using type annotations or by passing the signature as the first positional argument to `cuda.jit`.\n\nTo fix your code, you need to define the types directly in the decorator call or use a `numba.types.Signature` object. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n### Option 1: Using Type Annotations\n\nIf your `mandel` function is defined with explicit type annotations, you don't need to specify `argtypes` and `restype` separately.\n\n```python\nfrom numba import cuda, float64, uint32\n\n@cuda.jit(device=True)\ndef mandel(x: float64, y: float64, maxiter: uint32):\n    # Your function implementation here\n    pass\n\n# Define the kernel function with appropriate types\n@cuda.jit\ndef mandel_kernel(...):\n    # Your kernel implementation here\n    pass\n```\n\n### Option 2: Passing Signature Explicitly\n\nIf you prefer to explicitly pass the signature, you can do so like this:\n\n```python\nfrom numba import cuda, float64, uint32, types\n\n# Define the signature\nsignature = types.uint32(float64, float64, uint32)\n\n# Compile the function with the specified signature\nmandel_gpu = cuda.jit(signature, device=True)(mandel)\n```\n\n### Full Example\n\nHere's a full example assuming `mandel` is a simple function that you want to compile for GPU execution:\n\n```python\nfrom numba import cuda, float64, uint32, types\n\n# A simple Mandelbrot function for demonstration\ndef mandel(x: float64, y: float64, maxiter: uint32):\n    c = complex(x, y)\n    z = 0.0j\n    for i in range(maxiter):\n        z = z*z + c\n        if (z.real*z.real + z.imag*z.imag) >= 4:\n            return i\n    return maxiter\n\n# Define the signature\nsignature = types.uint32(float64, float64, uint32)\n\n# Compile the function for device execution\nmandel_gpu = cuda.jit(signature, device=True)(mandel)\n\n# Now you can use mandel_gpu in your CUDA kernel\n@cuda.jit\ndef mandel_kernel(dest, xstart, ystart, xscale, yscale, maxiter):\n    x = xstart + cuda.blockIdx.x * xscale / dest.shape[0]\n    y = ystart + cuda.blockIdx.y * yscale / dest.shape[1]\n    dest[cuda.blockIdx.x, cuda.blockIdx.y] = mandel_gpu(x, y, maxiter)\n```\n\nIn this example, we've defined the `mandel` function with type annotations and compiled it for device execution using the `cuda.jit` decorator. The `mandel_kernel` then uses the compiled `mandel_gpu` function within its kernel.", "shortest_response": "The error message you're encountering indicates that the use of `argtypes` and `restype` as keyword arguments in the `cuda.jit` decorator is deprecated. Instead, you should define the function signature as the first positional argument to the `cuda.jit` decorator.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to avoid this deprecation error:\n\n```python\nfrom numba import cuda, float64, uint32\n\n# Define the function signature\nsig = \"(float64, float64, uint32)\"\n\n@cuda.jit(sig)\ndef mandel(real, imag, maxiter):\n    # Your implementation here\n    pass\n\n# If you need a device version of the function\nmandel_device = cuda.jit(sig, device=True)(mandel)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function signature `(float64, float64, uint32)` is passed as the first positional argument to the `cuda.jit` decorator. This is the recommended way to specify the types of the function arguments and return type in Numba.\n\nIf you also want to create a device version of the function, you can do so by specifying `device=True` when decorating the function again with the same signature.\n\nPlease make sure to replace `pass` with the actual implementation of your `mandel` function.", "input_size": 325, "output_sizes": [296, 272, 281, 403, 374, 588, 662, 634, 343, 272], "output_mean": 412.5, "output_std": 147.94, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 284.75, "p50": 358.5, "p75": 541.75, "p99": 659.48}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 30.85744}, {"sample_id": "56cdfe9f3f9378e9", "prompt_id": "5b306505359cc6cb", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "create me a teleworking policy", "longest_response": "Certainly!

As a member of Team [Team Name], I found this exercise not only educational but also highly engaging, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of teamwork and leadership.\n\n#### Overview of the Exercise\n\nOur team consisted of five students who were tasked with navigating through five camps over six simulated days. Each day required us to analyze various pieces of information including weather forecasts, health conditions, supply levels, goal progress, and hiking speeds. Our primary objective was to successfully reach the summit while maintaining optimal health and resource management. Additionally, we faced three hidden challenges throughout our journey that impacted our ascent, hiking speed, health status, and overall success.\n\n#### Key Learning Points\n\n1. **Effective Communication:**\n   - One of the most critical aspects of our team's performance was our communication strategy. We quickly realized that not all information needed to be shared with every team member. For instance, detailed weather forecasts were best communicated to those responsible for planning our daily routes, while health updates were more relevant to the logistics team managing our supplies.\n   \n2. **Decision-Making Under Pressure:**\n   - The exercise highlighted the importance of quick and informed decision-making. Several times, we had to make split-second decisions based on limited or ambiguous data. These moments underscored the value of having a clear decision-making process and trusting each other's judgment.\n\n3. **Resource Management:**\n   - Managing our resources efficiently was crucial. We learned that over-allocating supplies could lead to shortages later on, whereas conserving too much could result in missed opportunities. Balancing these competing demands required careful planning and constant reassessment.\n\n4. **Adaptability and Flexibility:**\n   - The hidden challenges introduced unexpected variables that forced us to adapt our strategies. This taught us the importance of being flexible and ready to pivot when circumstances change.\n\n5. **Leadership Dynamics:**\n   - Leadership roles naturally emerged within the team, but it was essential that everyone felt heard and valued. Effective leadership involved facilitating discussions, ensuring that all voices were considered, and making collective decisions.\n\n#### Challenges Faced\n\nDespite our efforts, there were several challenges that impacted our performance:\n\n- **Information Overload:** At times, we struggled with the sheer volume of information we had to process. Streamlining our analysis became necessary to avoid decision paralysis.\n  \n- **Hidden Challenges:** The unpredictability of the hidden challenges made it difficult to plan ahead. We often found ourselves reacting rather than proactively preparing.\n\n- **Interpersonal Conflicts:** Differences in opinion and varying comfort levels with risk-taking occasionally led to disagreements. Resolving these conflicts in a timely manner was crucial to maintaining team cohesion.\n\n#### Personal Insights\n\nParticipating in this exercise provided me with several personal insights:\n\n- **Value of Preparation:** Being well-prepared can significantly influence outcomes. While we couldn't predict everything, thorough preparation helped us respond more effectively to unforeseen challenges.\n  \n- **Importance of Trust:** Trust among team members is foundational. It allowed us to rely on each other\u2019s expertise and made collaborative problem-solving smoother.\n  \n- **Continuous Improvement:** Reflecting on our actions and outcomes during the exercise helped us identify areas for improvement. Continuous learning and adaptation are key to success.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nOverall, the \"Climbing Through Camps\" exercise was a rewarding experience that enhanced my understanding of effective teamwork, strategic planning, and adaptive leadership.

Throughout the exercise, we encountered three hidden challenges that added complexity to our decision-making process.\n\n### Overview of the Exercise\n\nThe simulation was designed to mimic real-world scenarios where teams face numerous uncertainties and must adapt quickly to changing circumstances. Each day, we received updates on weather forecasts, the physical condition of each team member, available supplies, and our progress towards the summit. Additionally, we had to decide how much information to share within the team to ensure everyone was aligned and informed about the risks and opportunities ahead.\n\n### Key Learning Points\n\n#### Communication and Information Sharing\n\nOne of the most critical aspects of our performance was our communication strategy. We realized early on that not all team members had access to the same level of information, leading to some initial confusion and misalignment. To address this, we established a routine where one person would serve as the primary communicator, gathering all relevant data and disseminating it clearly to the rest of the team. This approach helped streamline our decision-making process and ensured that everyone was on the same page.\n\n#### Decision-Making Under Pressure\n\nThe introduction of hidden challenges forced us to think critically and make quick decisions. For instance, when faced with a sudden decrease in health status for one team member, we had to decide whether to halt the ascent temporarily or continue at a reduced pace. These types of decisions required a balance between maintaining momentum and ensuring the well-being of all team members.\n\n#### Adaptability and Flexibility\n\nThroughout the exercise, we learned the importance of being adaptable. When unexpected setbacks occurred, such as a reduction in hiking speed due to hidden obstacles, we had to adjust our plans accordingly. This meant reassessing our supply usage, revisiting our pacing strategy, and sometimes even altering our route. Flexibility was key to overcoming these challenges and staying on track.\n\n#### Leadership Dynamics\n\nAs a team, we experienced different leadership styles emerging naturally based on the situation. During critical moments, having a clear leader who could take charge and guide the team through difficult decisions was invaluable. However, it was equally important to allow other team members to contribute their ideas and perspectives, fostering a collaborative environment that leveraged everyone's strengths.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, this exercise provided a valuable opportunity to practice essential skills such as effective communication, strategic planning, and crisis management in a controlled setting. It highlighted the importance of teamwork and the impact of individual contributions on collective success. Moving forward, I believe our team is better equipped to handle similar challenges in future projects, both within and outside of the classroom.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]", "input_size": 135, "output_sizes": [717, 748, 654, 642, 777, 827, 601, 765, 810, 795], "output_mean": 733.6, "output_std": 73.48, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 669.75, "p50": 756.5, "p75": 790.5, "p99": 825.47}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 36.40444}, {"sample_id": "81038f444f8ac30b", "prompt_id": "0a825eed5935dba9", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Act as an interviewer.

The function seems to be responsible for fetching experiment settings from a file path and processing them.\n\nLet\u2019s break down what's happening in this code:\n\n1. **Prologue**:\n   - The function starts by setting up its stack frame with standard x86-64 prologue instructions (`pushq %rbp`, `movq %rsp, %rbp`, `subq $0x40, %rsp`). This allocates space on the stack for local variables and saves the base pointer.\n   \n2. **Parameter Handling**:\n   - It stores the first two arguments (`%rdi` and `%rsi`) into the stack frame at offsets `-0x8(%rbp)` and `-0x10(%rbp)`. These likely correspond to `self` and `_cmd` in Objective-C methods.\n   \n3. **Fetching File Path**:\n   - It calls `objc_msgSend` to invoke the `getExperimentSettingsFilePath` method on the receiver object stored in `%rdi`. The result is retained and stored at `-0x20(%rbp)`.\n   \n4. **File Management**:\n   - Next, it retrieves the shared instance of `NSFileManager` and retains it, storing it at `-0x28(%rbp)`.\n   \n5. **Check File Existence**:\n   - Using the file manager, it checks if the file exists at the path obtained earlier. If the file does not exist, it jumps to label `0x10a09789e`, otherwise it proceeds to read the file contents.\n   \n6. **Read File Contents**:\n   - If the file exists, it reads the contents using `contentsAtPath:` and retains the returned data, storing it at `-0x30(%rbp)`.\n   \n7. **Process Data**:\n   - If the file content is non-null, it initializes an `ExperimentSettings` object with the JSON data from the file. The newly created `ExperimentSettings` object is stored at `-0x18(%rbp)` and the original JSON data is released.\n   \n8. **Store Results**:\n   - Finally, it stores the `ExperimentSettings` object and other necessary values into their respective slots in the stack frame. It also retains the `ExperimentSettings` object to ensure it remains valid after the method returns.\n   \n9. **Epilogue**:\n   - The function cleans up its stack frame and returns, restoring the previous state of the stack.\n\nThe assembly code is quite low-level and tightly coupled with the Objective-C runtime system, which manages memory and objects dynamically.

For user management and payment processing, there are a few approaches you can take:\n\n### Using WordPress Plugins\n\nIf you want to leverage existing WordPress plugins for user registration and payment processing, you would typically need to interact with these features through an API. WordPress has REST APIs that allow you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various entities, including users and posts.\n\nHowever, for more complex functionalities like user registration and payments, you might face some limitations because:\n\n1. **User Registration**: While you can use the WordPress REST API to register users, you'll need to handle the UI and validation in your Next.js application.\n   \n2. **Payment Processing**: Most payment plugins for WordPress rely on the front-end being built with WordPress templates. Integrating these directly into a Next.js application could be challenging without significant customization.\n\n### Creating Functionalities in Next.js\n\nFor a seamless experience, it's often better to implement these functionalities directly within your Next.js application. Here\u2019s how you can approach this:\n\n1. **User Management**:\n   - Use the WordPress REST API to register new users, fetch user data, and manage authentication.\n   - Implement forms and validation logic in your Next.js application.\n   - Use libraries like `next-auth` for handling authentication flows if necessary.\n\n2. **Payment Processing**:\n   - Integrate with third-party payment gateways via their APIs (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).\n   - Implement secure payment forms and handle callbacks within your Next.js application.\n\n### Example Workflow\n\nHere\u2019s a high-level example of how you might structure a user registration process:\n\n1. **Frontend (Next.js)**:\n    - Create a registration form using React.\n    - Handle form submission and validation.\n    - Send a POST request to the WordPress REST API endpoint to create a new user.\n\n2. **Backend (WordPress)**:\n    - Ensure the REST API is set up correctly to handle user creation requests.\n    - Optionally, use a plugin like WPGraphQL for a more robust API layer.\n\n### Example Code Snippet\n\nHere\u2019s a simple example of sending a POST request to create a user via the WordPress REST API from Next.js:\n\n```javascript\nimport axios from 'axios';\n\nconst createUser = async (userData) => {\n  const url = 'https://your-wordpress-site.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users';\n  const response = await axios.post(url, userData, {\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'Authorization': `Basic ${btoa('consumer_key:consumer_secret')}`\n    }\n  });\n  return response.data;\n};\n\n// Usage\ncreateUser({\n  username: 'newuser',\n  email: 'newuser@example.com',\n  password: 'securepassword'\n}).then(user => console.log(user));\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile you can technically use WordPress plugins for user management and payments, it\u2019s usually more practical and flexible to implement these functionalities directly in your Next.js application. This way, you maintain control over the user experience and can easily integrate with modern frontend frameworks and third-party services.", "shortest_response": "Using WordPress as a headless CMS with Next.js 13 allows you to separate your front-end (built with Next.js) from the back-end content management capabilities provided by WordPress. However, when it comes to user account creation and payment processing, there are some considerations:\n\n### User Account Creation\n- **WordPress Plugins:** If you want to use WordPress for user account management, you would typically handle this on the WordPress side, using plugins that provide REST API endpoints for user registration and authentication.\n- **Next.js Integration:** In your Next.js application, you would need to consume these REST API endpoints to handle user registration and login. This means you would need to write custom code in your Next.js app to interact with the WordPress APIs.\n\n### Payment Processing\n- **WordPress Plugins:** There are many WordPress plugins available for payment processing, such as WooCommerce, which also provides REST API endpoints for handling payments.\n- **Next.js Integration:** Similar to user account management, you would need to integrate with these APIs in your Next.js application. This could involve writing custom code to handle payment forms, submit payment data via the API, and process responses.\n\n### Recommendations\n1. **API Endpoints:** Ensure that any WordPress plugin you choose provides comprehensive REST API documentation. Many popular plugins like WooCommerce and Jetpack offer robust APIs.\n2. **Authentication:** For secure interactions, consider implementing OAuth or JWT-based authentication to ensure secure communication between your Next.js app and WordPress.\n3. **Custom Code:** You will likely need to write custom code in your Next.js app to handle user interfaces, form submissions, and API requests.\n4. **Security:** Always follow best practices for securing user data and payment information, both in your Next.js app and in how you integrate with WordPress.\n\nIn summary, while you can leverage WordPress plugins for managing user accounts and payments, you will still need to develop the necessary integration logic within your Next.js application to make full use of these features. This approach leverages the strengths of both systems\u2014WordPress for its content management capabilities and Next.js for modern, efficient front-end development.", "input_size": 70, "output_sizes": [488, 487, 659, 421, 440, 423, 472, 437, 655, 485], "output_mean": 496.7, "output_std": 83.82, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 437.75, "p50": 478.5, "p75": 487.75, "p99": 658.64}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 26.82528}, {"sample_id": "c474b38ca4cece0f", "prompt_id": "364d699254d55eaf", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "What kind of code is this? \n\nprecision highp float;\nuniform float time;\nuniform vec2 resolution;\nvarying vec3 fPosition;\nvarying vec3 fNormal;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n gl\\_FragColor = vec4(fNormal, 1.0);\n}", "longest_response": "The code you've provided is written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), which is used for writing shaders in OpenGL and WebGL environments.

This comes down to two main problems for users: Do they have permission to use that underlying work, and will the artist or writer be compensated for that use.\nIn an interview [at the Upfront Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-ffIaLq1RQ&list=PLavjJa4-6tbpl3YYLMbulQSTDtThEr6X9&index=9) earlier this month, [Adobe\u2019s Scott Belsky](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/02/adobes-scott-belsky-talks-generative-ai-and-why-its-not-going-to-end-up-like-web3/) talked about the concerns that enterprise clients have around using content generated with this technology. \u201cA lot of our very big enterprise customers are very concerned about using generative AI without understanding how it was trained. They don\u2019t see it as viable for commercial use,\u201d he said at the time.\nThat was before Adobe had announced its own generative AI product. Just this morning the company released a beta of a new generative AI product [called Firefly](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/21/adobe-firefly-generative-ai/), and Adobe\u2019s president of digital media, David Wadhwani promised that companies needn\u2019t worry about the sourcing, and that artists would be taken care of, as well.\nIn an interview with [CNBC\u2019s Jon Fortt this morning](https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:7043929300810559488/), Wadhwani stated that the images being used in Firefly come from the company\u2019s own library. \u201cWe have the ability now to train on hundreds of millions of pieces of content that are fully licensed and are going to produce generative output that is safe for commercial use,\u201d he said.\nThe flip side of that is how the artist whose work is being used will be compensated.\n\u201cWe want to be very clear that we are doing this in a way that will ultimately be commercially good for them. And we\u2019re committing to making sure that we compensate them for revenues generated from Firefly \u2013 and we\u2019ll be releasing more of those details as we come out of the Firefly beta in the months ahead,\u201d Wadhwani told Fortt.\nThe devil will surely be in the details there, and artists will be watching closely to see if the company does indeed compensate them fairly. Wadhwani indicated they are working directly with the artists who contribute to Adobe Stock to figure out how this going to work in practice.\n\u201cFirst and foremost we want to do this in concert and in conversation with every one that is a contributor to the Adobe Stock. So we are reaching out. We\u2019ve already started conversations with the broad base of creators that are contributing, and we\u2019re not ready to state what we\u2019re going to do when we come out of beta because we\u2019re still learning. The most important thing is that we\u2019re committed to making sure that as we go through this process, we want to create more opportunity for the breadth of people who are contributing. And we think we can do that across the large contributors and the long tail,\u201d he said.\n\n> [Is generative AI really ready for the enterprise?](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/12/is-generative-ai-really-ready-for-the-enterprise/)\n> \n> \n\nHe says that ultimately, everybody should win because there will be so much more demand for content, and he believes that this can be good for both Adobe to attract new customers with less artistic skill to its platform, as well as the stock artists whose work is being used as a basis to generate new pieces.\n\u201cSo in that world where content becomes such a fuel for growth, we think that there\u2019s an opportunity to leverage generative technology and Adobe Stock and the broad base of contributors to make sure that they are making more money and being compensated for the incredible work that they\u2019re doing for this entire supply chain of content.\u201d\nTime will tell if that\u2019s the case.", "longest_response": "```markdown\nAdobe a lanc\u00e9 une version b\u00eata de son produit d'IA g\u00e9n\u00e9rative appel\u00e9 Firefly, promettant que ce dernier sera utilis\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e9thique et que les artistes seront correctement compens\u00e9s.

Here are a few points of feedback:\n\n1. **Spelling and Grammar**: There are a couple of minor spelling errors (\"cano\" should be \"canoe,\" and \"lifesaver\" should be capitalized as \"LifeSaver\" if it's referring to a specific brand or commonly known type of life jacket). Also, \"i put my oars\" should be \"I put my oars.\"\n\n2. **Punctuation**: Consider adding more punctuation to improve readability. For example, you might want to add commas or periods to break up longer sentences.\n\n3. **Descriptive Language**: Your use of descriptive language is excellent. Phrases like \"gigantic mountains covered with green trees and a lot of the whitest snow I've seen\" and \"the reflection of what was in front of me\" create a strong visual image. However, you could perhaps vary your sentence structure a bit more to keep the flow interesting.\n\n4. **Consistency**: Ensure consistency in the way you describe things. For instance, you mention the water as \"dark\" but then talk about seeing reflections clearly. Clarifying whether the water is dark due to depth or time of day could help.\n\n5. **Metaphors and Similes**: Your simile comparing clouds to \"cotton candy\" is particularly charming and adds a whimsical touch to your description. You might consider adding more such comparisons to enrich the imagery further.\n\nHere\u2019s a slightly revised version incorporating these suggestions:\n\n---\n\nToday, I am going kayaking alone in the lake around the big mountains.

This setting does indeed affect how many requests can be handled at the same time, but it's not exactly the same as saying it's the number of requests the server can handle concurrently.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Concurrency vs. Worker Limit**: The number of concurrent requests a server can handle is influenced by various factors including system resources (CPU, memory), network bandwidth, and the efficiency of your application code. While the worker limit is a significant factor, other aspects also play a role.\n\n2. **Worker Limit Configuration**: The PHP-FPM configuration file (`php-fpm.conf` or `www.conf`) allows you to set parameters like `pm.max_children`, `pm.start_servers`, and `pm.min_spare_servers`. These settings define how many PHP processes can be active at any given time and help control resource usage.\n\n3. **Request Handling**: When a request comes in, if there are available workers, it will be processed immediately. If all workers are busy, the request might wait until a worker becomes available, or it might be queued depending on the configuration.\n\nSo while the PHP worker limit is crucial for determining concurrency, it's part of a larger system that includes the web server itself (like Apache or Nginx), the PHP runtime environment, and the underlying hardware capabilities.

It's not exactly the same as the number of requests the server can handle concurrently, but it does influence that capacity.\n\nWhen you set a higher worker limit, you allow for more PHP processes to be available to handle incoming requests, which can improve the ability of your server to manage concurrent requests. However, the actual number of requests your server can handle concurrently also depends on other factors like the complexity of the scripts being executed, the server's hardware capabilities, network conditions, and how efficiently your application uses resources.\n\nIn summary, while the PHP worker limit is an important factor affecting concurrency, it's just one piece of the puzzle when considering the overall capacity of your server to handle concurrent requests.", "input_size": 59, "output_sizes": [189, 235, 244, 234, 319, 223, 245, 178, 209, 218], "output_mean": 229.4, "output_std": 36.6, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 211.25, "p50": 228.5, "p75": 241.75, "p99": 312.34}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 11.73687}, {"sample_id": "971c4ba2a456066b", "prompt_id": "5cbb45b63a86d256", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "The most recent ad (released January 2023) is set in an fictional time where people are struggling to define what it means to be Australian but, ironically, some find it very easy to define what is Un-Australian", "longest_response": "It sounds like you're referring to a creative and thought-provoking advertisement that explores the complexities of national identity, specifically in the context of Australia.

Below is an outline of how you can achieve this using JavaScript and web technologies. This example assumes you're familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Browser Extension\n\nFirst, create a directory for your extension and set up the necessary files:\n\n- `manifest.json`: The manifest file defines the metadata and permissions of the extension.\n- `background.js`: A background script to handle certain tasks.\n- `content.js`: A content script to interact with the webpage.\n- `popup.html`: An optional popup interface for the extension.\n- `popup.js`: An optional script for the popup interface.\n- `icon.png`: An icon for the extension.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Manifest File\n\nCreate a `manifest.json` file in your project directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"manifest_version\": 3,\n  \"name\": \"Tezos Address Linker\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"description\": \"Links Tezos wallet or contract addresses to tzkt.io\",\n  \"permissions\": [\n    \"activeTab\"\n  ],\n  \"content_scripts\": [\n    {\n      \"matches\": [\"<all_urls>\"],\n      \"js\": [\"content.js\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"browser_action\": {\n    \"default_popup\": \"popup.html\",\n    \"default_icon\": {\n      \"16\": \"icon.png\",\n      \"48\": \"icon.png\",\n      \"128\": \"icon.png\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"icons\": {\n    \"16\": \"icon.png\",\n    \"48\": \"icon.png\",\n    \"128\": \"icon.png\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create the Content Script\n\nCreate a `content.js` file to process and link addresses on webpages:\n\n```javascript\nfunction linkAddresses() {\n  const regex = /tz[1-3][1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{33}/g; // Regular expression to match Tezos addresses\n  const elements = document.body.innerText.match(regex);\n  \n  if (elements) {\n    elements.forEach(address => {\n      const anchor = document.createElement('a');\n      anchor.href = `https://tzkt.io/${address}`;\n      anchor.textContent = address;\n      anchor.target = '_blank';\n      \n      // Find and replace the text in the original document\n      const parentElement = document.evaluate(`//*[contains(text(), '${address}')][not(ancestor::a)]`, document, null, XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE).singleNodeValue;\n      if (parentElement) {\n        const range = document.createRange();\n        range.selectNodeContents(parentElement);\n        const selection = window.getSelection();\n        selection.removeAllRanges();\n        selection.addRange(range);\n        \n        const span = document.createElement('span');\n        span.innerHTML = selection.toString().replace(new RegExp(address, 'g'), `<a href=\"https://tzkt.io/${address}\" target=\"_blank\">${address}</a>`);\n        parentElement.innerHTML = span.innerHTML;\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n// Run the function when the DOM content is loaded\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', linkAddresses);\n```\n\n### Step 4: Add an Optional Popup Interface\n\nIf you want to add a popup interface for the extension, create `popup.html` and `popup.js`. For simplicity, we'll just have a basic popup with the extension name.\n\n**popup.html:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Tezos Address Linker</title>\n  <style>\n    body { width: 200px; padding: 10px; }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <h2>Tezos Address Linker</h2>\n  <p>Automatically links Tezos addresses to tzkt.io.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**popup.js:** (optional, no additional functionality needed here)\n\n```javascript\n// popup.js\n```\n\n### Step 5: Testing Your Extension\n\n1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.\n2. Enable \"Developer mode\" using the toggle in the top right corner.\n3. Click \"Load unpacked\" and select your extension's directory.\n4. Test your extension on various pages to ensure it correctly identifies and links Tezos addresses.\n\nThis is a basic implementation.

Below is a basic outline of how you can achieve this using JavaScript and the Chrome Extension API.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Manifest File\n\nFirst, create a `manifest.json` file in your project directory. This file tells the browser about your extension's permissions and other metadata.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"manifest_version\": 3,\n  \"name\": \"Tezos Address Linker\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"description\": \"Automatically links Tezos wallet or contract addresses to tzkt.io.\",\n  \"permissions\": [\n    \"activeTab\"\n  ],\n  \"background\": {\n    \"service_worker\": \"background.js\"\n  },\n  \"content_scripts\": [\n    {\n      \"matches\": [\"<all_urls>\"],\n      \"js\": [\"content.js\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create the Content Script\n\nCreate a `content.js` file where you'll write the script that searches for Tezos addresses and replaces them with links.\n\n```javascript\n// content.js\nfunction linkAddresses() {\n    const regex = /tz[1-3][1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{33}/g; // Regular expression to match Tezos addresses\n    const elements = document.body.innerText.match(regex);\n\n    if (elements) {\n        elements.forEach(element => {\n            const linkElement = document.createElement('a');\n            linkElement.href = `https://tzkt.io/${element}`;\n            linkElement.textContent = element;\n            linkElement.target = \"_blank\"; // Opens link in new tab\n            document.body.innerHTML = document.body.innerHTML.replace(element, '');\n            document.body.appendChild(linkElement);\n        });\n    }\n}\n\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', linkAddresses);\n```\n\n### Step 3: Add Background Script (Optional)\n\nIf you need to perform actions when the extension is loaded, you might want to include a background script. For now, we'll keep it simple and just use the content script.\n\n### Step 4: Testing Your Extension\n\nTo test your extension:\n\n1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.\n2. Enable \"Developer mode\" using the toggle in the top right corner.\n3. Click on \"Load unpacked\".\n4. Select the folder containing your extension files (`manifest.json`, `content.js`).\n\nYour extension should now be active and will automatically link Tezos addresses to `tzkt.io`.\n\n### Notes:\n- The regular expression used to detect Tezos addresses assumes they start with `tz1`, `tz2`, or `tz3`. Adjust the regex if you need to support other formats.\n- This example uses `document.body.innerText` which may not work as expected for complex web pages. Consider using more robust methods to traverse and modify DOM nodes.\n- Always ensure you handle privacy concerns and respect user settings when developing browser extensions.\n\nThis is a basic implementation.

There seems to be a typo in the export statement (`Backdrop1` instead of `Backdrop`).\n\nHere's how you could adjust your component to include an opacity style and properly apply it:\n\n```javascript\nimport styles from './Backdrop.module.css';\n\nfunction Backdrop({ opacity }) {\n    // Apply the opacity style using inline style or className\n    const backdropStyle = { \n        backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, ' + opacity + ')', \n        position: 'fixed',\n        top: 0,\n        left: 0,\n        width: '100%',\n        height: '100%',\n        zIndex: 1000, // Ensure it overlays other content\n        display: 'flex',\n        justifyContent: 'center',\n        alignItems: 'center'\n    };\n\n    return (\n        <div style={backdropStyle}>\n            {/* Your content goes here */}\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default Backdrop;\n```\n\nIn this version of the `Backdrop` component:\n- The `opacity` prop is used to set the background color's alpha channel directly in the style object.\n- The `position`, `width`, `height`, and `zIndex` properties ensure the backdrop covers the entire screen and stays above other elements.\n- `justifyContent` and `alignItems` center any child content within the backdrop.\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer to use a CSS module to handle styles, you might define a class in your `Backdrop.module.css` file like so:\n\n```css\n.backdrop {\n    position: fixed;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n    z-index: 1000; /* Ensure it overlays other content */\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: center;\n    align-items: center;\n}\n```\n\nThen, in your JavaScript/React file:\n\n```javascript\nimport styles from './Backdrop.module.css';\n\nfunction Backdrop({ opacity }) {\n    return (\n        <div className={styles.backdrop} style={{ backgroundColor: `rgba(0, 0, 0, ${opacity})` }}>\n            {/* Your content goes here */}\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default Backdrop;\n```\n\nThis approach separates concerns better, as the CSS is handled in a separate file, making your JavaScript cleaner. The inline style for `backgroundColor` still allows dynamic opacity changes based on the `opacity` prop.", "shortest_response": "It looks like you're trying to create a `Backdrop` component in React that accepts an `opacity` prop to style its background.

That sounds like an exciting project. Creating a Tabletop Role-Playing Game (TTRPG) can be both challenging and rewarding. To get started, let's outline some key aspects of your game that will differentiate it from Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) and other similar RPGs.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Setting\nThink about where your game takes place. Is it in a fantasy world, a futuristic society, a post-apocalyptic wasteland, or something entirely different? The setting will influence the rules, characters, and overall feel of your game.\n\n### Step 2: Character Creation\nDecide how players will create their characters. Will there be classes or archetypes? How do they level up? What kind of abilities and skills will characters have?\n\n### Step 3: Core Mechanics\nConsider what dice you'll use, how combat works, and how players will interact with the game world. Will there be a skill system? How will magic work? What about movement and positioning in combat?\n\n### Step 4: Story and Adventure\nHow will the game facilitate storytelling? Will there be pre-written adventures or is the game designed to be more open-ended? What kind of themes and narratives do you want to explore?\n\n### Step 5: Rules and Balance\nEnsure that the rules are clear and balanced so that no class or character type has a significant advantage over others. This will help maintain fairness and enjoyment for all players.\n\n### Example Outline:\nLet\u2019s say we decide to create a game set in a steampunk-inspired world where technology and magic coexist.

The game combines elements of word games and strategy. Each player has a set of cards representing resources (like labor, materials, and technology) and a deck of cards with various keywords and phrases related to railway construction.\n\n**Objective:** To create the most persuasive and comprehensive bid document that scores the highest points based on a combination of strategic resource allocation and clever use of language to highlight the benefits and feasibility of the proposed railway project.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Resource Management:** Players must allocate their limited resources to different aspects of the bid, such as environmental impact, cost efficiency, and community benefits.\n- **Bid Writing:** Using the keyword cards, players construct sentences and paragraphs that address specific criteria outlined in the bid request. The more creative and persuasive the writing, the higher the score.\n- **Presentation:** There could be a phase where players present their bids to the judges (other players or a neutral judge), using the game's rules to simulate a formal presentation.\n\n### Idea 2: Track Talk\n**Gameplay Overview:** In this game, players are part of a consortium bidding for a major railway project. The game is played over several rounds, each representing a different phase of the bid process.\n\n**Objective:** To accumulate the most points by winning key sections of the bid process, including preliminary research, public consultations, and final presentations.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Research Phase:** Players gather information cards about potential routes, costs, and environmental impacts. They must strategically decide which pieces of information to include in their bid.\n- **Consultation Phase:** Players engage with community cards, each representing different stakeholders (e.g., local residents, businesses, environmental groups). Players need to convince these stakeholders of the benefits of their proposal.\n- **Presentation Phase:** Players use their collected information and endorsements from stakeholders to craft a compelling final bid. Points are awarded based on the strength of the arguments and the quality of the presentation.\n\n### Idea 3: Railways & Rhetoric\n**Gameplay Overview:** This game is set in a competitive environment where players are consultants working for different firms vying for the contract to design and build a new railway network. The game focuses heavily on negotiation and rhetoric.\n\n**Objective:** To form alliances, negotiate contracts, and deliver the best possible bid that wins the favor of all parties involved, including government officials, investors, and local communities.\n\n**Mechanics:**\n- **Negotiation Rounds:** Players engage in multiple rounds of negotiation, where they can trade resources, share information, or make promises to secure support for their bid.\n- **Public Speaking Challenges:** During certain phases, players must give speeches or presentations to gain support. The effectiveness of these speeches can influence the outcome of the bid.\n- **Alliance Building:** Players can form temporary or long-term alliances to strengthen their bids.

Here\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n### 1. Setting Up Multiple VHosts in a Container\n\nTo serve multiple vhosts from a single container, you need to configure your web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to handle different domains or subdomains. For example, if you're using Nginx, you would set up different `server` blocks for each vhost.\n\n#### Example Configuration for Nginx:\n```nginx\nhttp {\n    server {\n        listen 80;\n        server_name example.com;\n        location / {\n            root /var/www/example.com;\n            index index.html;\n        }\n    }\n\n    server {\n        listen 80;\n        server_name subdomain.example.com;\n        location / {\n            root /var/www/subdomain.example.com;\n            index index.html;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis configuration tells Nginx to serve content from `/var/www/example.com` when the domain `example.com` is requested and from `/var/www/subdomain.example.com` when `subdomain.example.com` is requested.\n\n### 2. Running the Web Server in a Docker Container\n\nNext, you'll need to package your web server with the above configuration into a Docker container. You can do this by creating a Dockerfile that copies your configuration files and website contents into the container.\n\n#### Example Dockerfile for Nginx:\n```Dockerfile\nFROM nginx:latest\n\nCOPY ./nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\nCOPY ./html /var/www/html\n```\n\nHere, `nginx.conf` is your custom Nginx configuration file, and `html` contains the directories for each vhost's content.\n\n### 3. Using Docker Compose or Kubernetes Ingress Controller\n\nTo expose these services externally so that they can be accessed via the local network, you can use Docker Compose or a Kubernetes setup with an ingress controller.\n\n#### Docker Compose Example:\nIf you're using Docker Compose, you can define your service in a `docker-compose.yml` file like this:\n\n```yaml\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  web:\n    build: .\n    ports:\n      - \"80:80\"\n```\n\nThis will map port 80 of your host machine to port 80 of the container, allowing external access.\n\n#### Kubernetes Ingress Controller Example:\nFor Kubernetes, you'd typically use an ingress controller like NGINX Ingress Controller. First, deploy your service:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: web-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: web-app\n  ports:\n    - protocol: TCP\n      port: 80\n      targetPort: 80\n---\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: web-deployment\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: web-app\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: web-app\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: web-container\n        image: your-docker-image-name\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n```\n\nThen, you can define an ingress resource to route traffic:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: web-ingress\n  annotations:\n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - host: example.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: web-service\n            port:\n              number: 80\n  - host: subdomain.example.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: web-service\n            port:\n              number: 80\n```\n\nThis setup routes requests to `example.com` and `subdomain.example.com` to the same service but different paths or configurations based on the host header.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, you can run multiple vhosts inside a single Docker container and configure an ingress controller to route traffic appropriately, making each vhost accessible via its respective domain or subdomain over your local network.", "shortest_response": "Yes, it is possible to run multiple virtual hosts (vhosts) within a single Docker container and expose them through the network using an ingress controller or directly with Docker's networking capabilities. However, this setup can vary depending on your specific application and environment.\n\n### Running Multiple VHosts in a Single Container\n\nTo run multiple vhosts within a single container, you typically need to configure your web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to handle different domains or subdomains. Here\u2019s how you can do that:\n\n1. **Configure Web Server:**\n   - For Nginx, you would create separate `server` blocks for each domain.\n   - For Apache, you would use `VirtualHost` directives for each domain.\n\n2. **Dockerfile Example for Nginx:**\n   ```dockerfile\n   FROM nginx:latest\n\n   COPY ./nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n   ```\n\n   In `nginx.conf`, you might have something like:\n   ```\n   http {\n       include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;\n   }\n   ```\n\n   And then you would have individual configuration files in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` such as `site1.conf` and `site2.conf`.\n\n3. **Run the Docker Container:**\n   When running the container, make sure to expose the necessary ports:\n   ```bash\n   docker run -d --name my-nginx -p 80:80 -p 443:443 my-nginx-image\n   ```\n\n### Exposing VHosts Through the Network\n\nTo allow access to these vhosts from the local network, you need to ensure that your DNS resolution or `/etc/hosts` file correctly maps the domains to the IP address of your Docker host.\n\nAlternatively, if you're working in a Kubernetes environment, you can use an ingress controller to manage routing based on hostnames. Here\u2019s a brief overview:\n\n1. **Ingress Controller Setup:**\n   Deploy an ingress controller (like NGINX Ingress Controller) in your Kubernetes cluster.\n\n2. **Create Ingress Resources:**\n   Define an `Ingress` resource for each vhost, specifying the hostname and the service to which traffic should be routed.\n\n   Example YAML for an Ingress resource:\n   ```yaml\n   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\n   kind: Ingress\n   metadata:\n     name: site1-ingress\n   spec:\n     rules:\n     - host: site1.example.com\n       http:\n         paths:\n         - path: /\n           pathType: Prefix\n           backend:\n             service:\n               name: site1-service\n               port:\n                 number: 80\n   ```\n\n3. **DNS Configuration:**\n   Ensure that `site1.example.com` resolves to the IP address of your Kubernetes cluster\u2019s load balancer or the node where the ingress controller is running.\n\n### Summary\n\nRunning multiple vhosts within a single Docker container involves configuring your web server appropriately and ensuring proper DNS resolution.

However, it's important to note that `<iframe>` elements themselves are HTML tags and are rendered client-side, but their content can be dynamically set based on server-rendered data.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Create a Component\n\nFirst, create a component that will include the `<iframe>`. This component can be dynamic, meaning it can accept props (like the URL of the page to embed) and render the `<iframe>` accordingly.\n\n```jsx\n// components/IframeEmbed.jsx\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconst IframeEmbed = ({ src }) => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Embedded Content</h2>\n      <iframe src={src} title=\"Embedded Content\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameBorder=\"0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default IframeEmbed;\n```\n\n### Step 2: Use the Component in a Page or Another Component\n\nNow, use this component in your pages or other components. You can pass the `src` prop to the `<IframeEmbed>` component to specify the URL you want to embed.\n\n```jsx\n// pages/index.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport IframeEmbed from '../components/IframeEmbed';\n\nconst Home = () => {\n  const urlToEmbed = 'https://example.com'; // Replace with the actual URL you want to embed\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>\n      <IframeEmbed src={urlToEmbed} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Home;\n```\n\n### Step 3: Considerations for Server-Side Rendering\n\nWhile the `<iframe>` itself is rendered on the client side, you can control its content and attributes through server-side logic. For instance, you could fetch some data on the server and use that data to determine what URL to embed.\n\nNext.js allows you to perform server-side operations using `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`, depending on whether you're building a server-side rendered (SSR) page or a statically generated page.\n\n#### Example Using `getServerSideProps`\n\n```jsx\n// pages/index.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport IframeEmbed from '../components/IframeEmbed';\n\nconst Home = ({ src }) => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>\n      <IframeEmbed src={src} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  // Fetch some data from an API or database to decide what URL to embed\n  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/some-endpoint');\n  const data = await response.json();\n\n  return {\n    props: { src: data.urlToEmbed }, // Will be passed to the page component as props\n  };\n}\n\nexport default Home;\n```\n\nIn this example, `getServerSideProps` fetches some data from an endpoint and passes it as a prop (`src`) to the `Home` component, which then uses this prop to render the `<iframe>`.\n\nThis setup ensures that the `<iframe>` is embedded dynamically based on server-side data, enhancing the flexibility and reusability of your component.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nImplementing an `<iframe>` in Next.js 13 involves creating a reusable component and optionally fetching data server-side to dynamically set the `<iframe>`'s source. This approach leverages Next.js's capabilities for both static generation and server-side rendering to provide a flexible and efficient solution.", "shortest_response": "Implementing an `<iframe>` in a Next.js 13 application is quite straightforward. However, if you're looking to dynamically generate the `<iframe>` content on the server side (SSR), you might want to do some data fetching or manipulation before rendering the `<iframe>`. Below, I'll provide a basic example of how you can achieve this.\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Page\n\nFirst, create a new page file for your component, for example, `pages/iframe.js`.\n\n### Step 2: Fetch Data on Server Side (Optional)\n\nIf you need to fetch data to determine the source URL of the `<iframe>`, you can use Next.js's built-in data fetching methods like `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`. Here's an example using `getServerSideProps`:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/iframe.js\n\nimport { useEffect } from 'react';\n\nexport default function IframePage({ src }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Iframe Example</h1>\n      <iframe src={src} title=\"dynamic-iframe\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600px\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport async function getServerSideProps(context) {\n  // This could be any logic to fetch the URL or manipulate it.\n  const src = 'https://example.com'; // Replace with your actual URL logic here.\n  \n  return {\n    props: {\n      src,\n    },\n  };\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `getServerSideProps` is used to fetch the necessary data (in this case, just setting a hardcoded URL) and pass it as props to the component.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Component\n\nNow, when you navigate to `/iframe`, the `IframePage` component will render with the `<iframe>` tag containing the specified `src`.\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Security Considerations**: Be cautious about the URLs you embed within `<iframe>` tags, especially if they come from user input or external sources. Ensure that you validate and sanitize these inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities such as clickjacking attacks.\n- **Performance**: If the `<iframe>` content is static and doesn't change frequently, consider using `getStaticProps` instead of `getServerSideProps` to pre-render the page at build time.\n\nThis setup should give you a good starting point for embedding dynamic `<iframe>` content in a Next.js 13 application.", "input_size": 39, "output_sizes": [560, 590, 517, 686, 615, 661, 645, 507, 664, 776], "output_mean": 622.1, "output_std": 77.97, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 567.5, "p50": 630.0, "p75": 663.25, "p99": 767.9}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 32.03469}, {"sample_id": "9484122f1cf64445", "prompt_id": "2c2fc6cc3ac5e278", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "table of metal genres including atmospheric black metal and dimensions such as associated color, associated mushroom, associated superpower, associated mode of transportation, associated character of the book series red rising by pierce brown, associated type of rock, associated planet, associated chess piece, associated emoji (deep and thoughtful), and associated modern board game", "longest_response": "Creating a table that associates various elements with different metal subgenres can be an interesting way to explore the diverse themes and imagery within heavy metal music.

While TensorTrade itself does not directly support the Interactive Brokers API or the `ib_insync` library out-of-the-box, you can integrate these components to fetch real-time market data or place trades.\n\nTo use Interactive Brokers (IB) with TensorTrade, you would typically need to:\n\n1. **Set Up Interactive Brokers**: Ensure you have an Interactive Brokers account and the necessary permissions to access the API.\n2. **Use ib_insync**: This Python package provides a high-level interface to the IB API, making it easier to interact with IB's services.\n3. **Integrate with TensorTrade**: You can write custom data feeders or executors that use `ib_insync` to fetch data or execute trades, which can then be plugged into your TensorTrade environment.\n\nHere\u2019s a basic outline of how you might go about integrating `ib_insync` with TensorTrade:\n\n### Step 1: Install Required Libraries\nFirst, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:\n```bash\npip install ib_insync tensortrade\n```\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Interactive Brokers Connection\nYou'll need to establish a connection to Interactive Brokers using `ib_insync`.\n\n```python\nfrom ib_insync import IB, Stock\n\n# Initialize IB object\nib = IB()\n\n# Connect to the Interactive Brokers server\nib.connect('127.0.0.1', 7497, clientId=1)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Fetch Data Using ib_insync\nYou can create a custom data feeder to fetch data from Interactive Brokers and provide it to TensorTrade.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom tensortrade.data.casters import FeatureCaster\nfrom tensortrade.data.streaming import DataFeed\n\nclass IBDataFeed(DataFeed):\n    def __init__(self, symbol: str, timeframe: str):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.symbol = symbol\n        self.timeframe = timeframe\n        self.ib = IB()\n        self.ib.connect('127.0.0.1', 7497, clientId=1)\n\n    def start(self):\n        stock = Stock(self.symbol, 'SMART', 'USD')\n        bars = self.ib.reqHistoricalData(stock, endDateTime='', durationStr='30 D',\n                                         barSizeSetting=self.timeframe, whatToShow='MIDPOINT',\n                                         useRTH=True, formatDate=2)\n        df = util.df(bars)\n        df['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])\n        df.set_index('datetime', inplace=True)\n        self._data = df[['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']]\n        self._data = self._data.astype(float)\n\n    def stop(self):\n        self.ib.disconnect()\n\n    def next(self):\n        # Implement logic to fetch new data if needed\n        pass\n\n    def done(self):\n        return False\n\n# Example usage\nfeed = IBDataFeed(symbol=\"AAPL\", timeframe=\"1 min\")\nfeed.start()\n```\n\n### Step 4: Integrate with TensorTrade Environment\nNow, you can use this custom data feeder within a TensorTrade environment.\n\n```python\nfrom tensortrade.environments import TradingEnvironment\nfrom tensortrade.strategies import RiskManagementStrategy\n\n# Define a simple strategy and risk management strategy\nstrategy = ...  # Your strategy implementation here\nrisk_management = ...  # Your risk management strategy here\n\n# Create the environment\nenv = TradingEnvironment(\n    feed=feed,\n    actions=[0, 1, 2],  # Example actions: hold, buy, sell\n    reward_scheme=None,  # Define your reward scheme\n    risk_management=risk_management,\n    window_size=5  # Number of time steps to look back\n)\n\n# Start the environment\nenv.start()\n```\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile TensorTrade doesn\u2019t natively support `ib_insync`, you can extend its functionality by creating custom data feeders and executors that leverage `ib_insync`. This allows you to utilize Interactive Brokers' rich data and execution capabilities within the TensorTrade framework.
