This allows for O(1) lookup time when checking if a number is in the list.\n\nIt then iterates over each number in the set. If the previous number is not in the set, it could be the start of a sequence. It then checks how long the sequence is by incrementing the current number and the current length of the sequence as long as the next number is in the set.\n\nFinally, it updates the maximum length of the sub-sequence and returns it at the end.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n```python\nassert find_longest_conseq_subseq([1, 2, 2, 3], 4) == 3\nassert find_longest_conseq_subseq([1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2], 7) == 4\nassert find_longest_conseq_subseq([36, 41, 56, 35, 44, 33, 34, 92, 43, 32, 42], 11) == 5\n```", "shortest_response": "Here's a Python function that will find the length of the longest sub-sequence of consecutive integers:\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_conseq_subseq(arr, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the length of the longest sub-sequence of consecutive integers.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    arr (list): A list of integers.\n    n (int): The length of the array.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The length of the longest sub-sequence of consecutive integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Create a set from the array for O(1) lookup time\n    num_set = set(arr)\n    \n    # Initialize the maximum length to 0\n    max_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the set\n    for num in num_set:\n        # Check if the current number is the starting point of a sequence\n        if num - 1 not in num_set:\n            # Initialize the current number and the current length\n            current_num = num\n            current_length = 1\n            \n            # Check for consecutive numbers\n            while current_num + 1 in num_set:\n                current_num += 1\n                current_length += 1\n            \n            # Update the maximum length\n            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)\n    \n    # Return the maximum length\n    return max_length\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating a set from the input array. It then iterates over each number in the set, checking if it is the starting point of a sequence of consecutive numbers. If it is, it checks for consecutive numbers and keeps track of the length of the sequence. It updates the maximum length whenever it finds a longer sequence. Finally, it returns the maximum length found.", "input_size": 189, "output_sizes": [478, 467, 426, 439, 484, 470, 493, 352, 565, 599], "output_mean": 477.3, "output_std": 65.39, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 446.0, "p50": 474.0, "p75": 490.75, "p99": 595.94}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 15.10843}, {"sample_id": "093c31eb4356282d", "prompt_id": "afc1b379edb4f467", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "dataset": "Mbpp", "prompt_text": "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task: Write a python function to find the sum of even numbers at even positions.

The function takes two parameters: `lst`, the list of integers, and `n`, the number of elements in the list.\n2. It initializes a variable `total_sum` to 0, which will store the sum of even numbers at even positions.\n3. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the list, considering only even positions (i.e., positions `i` where `i` is even).\n4. Inside the loop, it checks if the number at the current position `i` is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder of the division of the number by 2 is 0, the number is even.\n5. If the number is even, it adds the number to the `total_sum`.\n6. Finally, the function returns the `total_sum`.\n\nYou can test this function using the provided test cases:\n\n```python\nprint(sum_even_and_even_index([5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8], 6))  # Output: 30\nprint(sum_even_and_even_index([3, 20, 17, 9, 2, 10, 18, 13, 6, 18], 10))  # Output: 26\nprint(sum_even_and_even_index([5, 6, 12, 1], 4))  # Output: 12\n```", "shortest_response": "Here is a Python function that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_and_even_index(lst, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of even numbers at even positions in a list.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    lst (list): A list of integers.\n    n (int): The length of the list.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The sum of even numbers at even positions in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the list with enumerate to get both index and value\n    for i, num in enumerate(lst):\n        \n        # Check if the index is even and the number is even\n        if i % 2 == 0 and num % 2 == 0:\n            \n            # Add the number to the sum\n            total_sum += num\n    \n    # Return the sum\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis function uses the `enumerate` function to iterate over the list and get both the index and the value of each element.

Here's the improved function:\n\n```python\ndef add_lists(list_to_add, tuple_to_add):\n    \"\"\"\n    Add the given list to the given tuple.\n\n    Args:\n        list_to_add (list): The list to be added.\n        tuple_to_add (tuple): The tuple to which the list is added.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: The resulting tuple after adding the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the list to a tuple and concatenate it with the tuple\n    result = tuple_to_add + tuple(list_to_add)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Test cases\nassert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)\nassert add_lists([6, 7, 8], (10, 11)) == (10, 11, 6, 7, 8)\nassert add_lists([7, 8, 9], (11, 12)) == (11, 12, 7, 8, 9)\n```\n\nThis function achieves the same result without modifying the original tuple.", "shortest_response": "Here's a Python function that adds the given list to the given tuple:\n\n```python\ndef add_lists(lst, tup):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function adds the elements of a given list to a given tuple.\n    \n    Args:\n        lst (list): The list of elements to be added.\n        tup (tuple): The tuple to which the list elements are to be added.\n    \n    Returns:\n        tuple: A new tuple with the list elements added to the original tuple.\n    \"\"\"\n    return tup + tuple(lst)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `+` operator to concatenate the two sequences (tuple and list).

In this case, we're looking for the n-th rectangular number.\n\nHere's a Python function that uses a loop to find the n-th rectangular number:\n\n```python\ndef find_rect_num(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the n-th rectangular number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The position of the rectangular number to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The n-th rectangular number.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    num = 1\n    while True:\n        # Check if the number is rectangular\n        for i in range(1, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):\n            if num % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                # Check if the rectangular factors are less than the current number\n                if i * i == num:\n                    count -= 1\n        # If we've found the n-th rectangular number, return it\n        if count == n:\n            return num\n        num += 1\n```\n\nThis function works by checking each number to see if it's rectangular. If it is, it increments the count. If the number is a perfect square, it decrements the count because it's counted twice. The function continues this process until it finds the n-th rectangular number, at which point it returns it.\n\nHowever, this function is not very efficient because it checks every number to see if it's rectangular. We can improve its efficiency by only checking numbers that are perfect squares or have an odd number of factors, because these are the only numbers that can be rectangular.\n\nHere's a more efficient version of the function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_rect_num(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the n-th rectangular number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The position of the rectangular number to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The n-th rectangular number.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    num = 1\n    while True:\n        # Calculate the number of factors of the current number\n        factors = 0\n        for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1):\n            if num % i == 0:\n                if i * i == num:\n                    factors += 1\n                else:\n                    factors += 2\n        # If the number of factors is even, it can be rectangular\n        if factors % 2 == 0:\n            count += factors // 2\n        # If we've found the n-th rectangular number, return it\n        if count == n:\n            return num\n        num += 1\n```\n\nThis function works by calculating the number of factors of the current number and then checking if it's even. If it's even, it can be rectangular, so it increments the count. The function continues this process until it finds the n-th rectangular number, at which point it returns it.\n\nThis function is much more efficient than the previous one because it only checks numbers that are perfect squares or have an odd number of factors.", "shortest_response": "## Finding the n-th Rectangular Number\n\nA rectangular number is a number that can be represented as the product of two smaller positive integers, i.e., `a*b`, where `a` and `b` are positive integers.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef find_rect_num(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the n-th rectangular number.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The position of the rectangular number to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The n-th rectangular number.\n    \"\"\"\n    rect_nums = []\n    i = 1\n    while len(rect_nums) < n:\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            rect_nums.append(i * j)\n        i += 1\n    return rect_nums[-1]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis function generates all rectangular numbers in ascending order and returns the n-th one. It starts from `i = 1` and for each `i`, it generates all rectangular numbers `i*j` for `j` ranging from `1` to `i`. The function continues this process until it has generated `n` rectangular numbers, and then it returns the last one, which is the n-th rectangular number.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n```python\nprint(find_rect_num(4))  # Output: 20\nprint(find_rect_num(5))  # Output: 30\nprint(find_rect_num(6))  # Output: 42\n```\n\nNote that this function has a time complexity of O(n*i^2) because it generates all rectangular numbers up to the n-th one.

The time complexity of the Shell sort algorithm is O(n log n) in the average case, making it efficient for sorting large datasets.", "shortest_response": "## Shell Sort Function in Python\n### Description\nThis function implements the Shell Sort algorithm, a comparison-based sorting algorithm that generalizes the insertion sort by allowing the comparison and exchange of far-apart elements.\n\n### Code\n```python\ndef shell_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts the given array using the Shell Sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The list of elements to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the gap size\n    gap = len(arr) // 2\n\n    # Continue the process until the gap size becomes zero\n    while gap > 0:\n        # Iterate over the array with the current gap size\n        for i in range(gap, len(arr)):\n            # Store the current element\n            temp = arr[i]\n\n            # Initialize the index for the previous gap\n            j = i\n\n            # Shift the elements of the previous gap to the right until the correct position for the current element is found\n            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\n                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]\n                j -= gap\n\n            # Place the current element at its correct position\n            arr[j] = temp\n\n        # Reduce the gap size for the next iteration\n        gap //= 2\n\n    # Return the sorted array\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n```python\n# Test the function with the provided test cases\nassert shell_sort([12, 23, 4, 5, 3, 2, 12, 81, 56, 95]) == [2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12, 23, 56, 81, 95]\nassert shell_sort([24, 22, 39, 34, 87, 73, 68]) == [22, 24, 34, 39, 68, 73, 87]\nassert shell_sort([32, 30, 16, 96, 82, 83, 74]) == [16, 30, 32, 74, 82, 83, 96]\n```", "input_size": 224, "output_sizes": [508, 503, 555, 497, 563, 467, 484, 459, 507, 548], "output_mean": 509.1, "output_std": 34.1, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 487.25, "p50": 505.0, "p75": 538.0, "p99": 562.28}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 14.34491}, {"sample_id": "0f96c7b085f44ac5", "prompt_id": "fe271383d569692b", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "dataset": "Mbpp", "prompt_text": "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.

The `is_tree_balanced` function checks if a binary tree is balanced by recursively checking if the absolute difference between the heights of its left and right subtrees is less than or equal to 1 for all nodes.\n\nTo test the function, you can create the binary trees with the following structure:\n\n```python\n# Test case 1: Unbalanced tree\nroot = TreeNode(1)\nroot.left = TreeNode(2)\nroot.right = TreeNode(3)\nroot.left.left = TreeNode(4)\nroot.left.right = TreeNode(5)\nroot.right.left = TreeNode(6)\nroot.right.right = TreeNode(7)\n\n# Test case 2: Balanced tree\nroot1 = TreeNode(1)\nroot1.left = TreeNode(2)\nroot1.right = TreeNode(3)\nroot1.left.left = TreeNode(4)\nroot1.left.right = TreeNode(5)\nroot1.right.left = TreeNode(6)\nroot1.right.right = TreeNode(7)\nroot1.left.left.left = TreeNode(8)\nroot1.left.left.right = TreeNode(9)\nroot1.left.right.left = TreeNode(10)\nroot1.left.right.right = TreeNode(11)\nroot1.right.left.left = TreeNode(12)\nroot1.right.left.right = TreeNode(13)\nroot1.right.right.left = TreeNode(14)\nroot1.right.right.right = TreeNode(15)\n\n# Test case 3: Unbalanced tree\nroot2 = TreeNode(1)\nroot2.left = TreeNode(2)\nroot2.right = TreeNode(3)\nroot2.left.left = TreeNode(4)\nroot2.left.right = TreeNode(5)\nroot2.right.left = TreeNode(6)\nroot2.right.right = TreeNode(7)\nroot2.left.left.left = TreeNode(8)\nroot2.left.left.right = TreeNode(9)\nroot2.left.right.left = TreeNode(10)\nroot2.left.right.right = TreeNode(11)\nroot2.right.left.left = TreeNode(12)\nroot2.right.left.right = TreeNode(13)\nroot2.right.right.left = TreeNode(14)\nroot2.right.right.right = TreeNode(15)\nroot2.left.left.left.left = TreeNode(16)\nroot2.left.left.left.right = TreeNode(17)\n```\n\nYou can then use the `assert` statements to test the `is_tree_balanced` function:\n\n```python\nassert is_tree_balanced(root) == False\nassert is_tree_balanced(root1) == True\nassert is_tree_balanced(root2) == False\n```", "shortest_response": "```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, x):\n        self.val = x\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\ndef is_tree_balanced(root):\n    def check_height(node):\n        if node is None:\n            return 0\n        left_height = check_height(node.left)\n        right_height = check_height(node.right)\n        if left_height == -1 or right_height == -1 or abs(left_height - right_height) > 1:\n            return -1\n        return 1 + max(left_height, right_height)\n\n    return check_height(root)!= -1\n```\n\nThis function uses a helper function `check_height` to recursively calculate the height of each subtree. If the height of a subtree is more than one greater than the height of its sibling, or if a node is `None`, the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the height of the subtree. The `is_tree_balanced` function then simply checks if the height of the entire tree is not `-1`.\n\nThe provided `TreeNode` class is a basic implementation of a binary tree node, with a value and pointers to the left and right child nodes.\n\nNote: The `root`, `root1`, and `root2` variables are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code.

This function converts the number to binary and checks if it contains the substring '10' or '01', which indicates that the binary representation has alternating 1s and 0s.\n\nThe main function starts from 1 and checks each number to see if it is an Entringer number. If it is, it increments a counter and checks if the counter has reached the desired position k. If it has, it returns the number.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n```python\nassert zigzag(4, 3) == 5\nassert zigzag(4, 2) == 4\nassert zigzag(3, 1) == 1\n```", "shortest_response": "## Entringer Number Function\n\nThe Entringer number function is defined as e(n, k) = n + k when n is even and e(n, k) = n - k when n is odd.\n\nHere's a Python function that implements this logic:\n\n```python\ndef zigzag(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Entringer number e(n, k).\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The first number.\n        k (int): The second number.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The Entringer number e(n, k).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n % 2 == 0:  # n is even\n        return n + k\n    else:  # n is odd\n        return n - k\n```\n\nThis function uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if `n` is even or odd.

If the two lists are equal, it means that the input list is already sorted, and the function returns `True`.

The parentheses around `\\w` and `[A-Z]` create groups, which allows us to reference these parts of the match in the replacement string. The replacement string `r'\\1 \\2'` inserts a space between the matched characters.\n\nHowever, this function does not work as expected for strings that start or end with a sequence of capital letters.

If the number is positive, it replaces the specified number of occurrences from the start of the string. If the number is negative, it replaces the specified number of occurrences from the end of the string.\n\nHowever, the above solution still has a problem: it will remove the first space if the string starts with a sequence of capital letters, but it will not add a space between the first character and the second character.

The idea is to iterate over the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when we encounter a matching closing bracket. When we encounter a closing bracket that doesn't match the top of the stack, we increment the swap count.\n\nHere's the Python function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef swap_count(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the minimum number of swaps required for bracket balancing in the given string.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The input string containing brackets.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The minimum number of swaps required.\n    \"\"\"\n    stack = []\n    swaps = 0\n\n    for char in s:\n        # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack\n        if char == '[':\n            stack.append(char)\n        # If the character is a closing bracket\n        elif char == ']':\n            # If the stack is empty or the top of the stack doesn't match the current closing bracket\n            if not stack or stack.pop()!= '[':\n                # Increment the swap count\n                swaps += 1\n\n    # The remaining opening brackets in the stack also need to be swapped\n    swaps += len(stack)\n\n    return swaps\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the input string, maintaining a stack of opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the top of the stack matches the current closing bracket. If not, it increments the swap count.

If they don't, the function returns `True`.\n\nHere's an explanation of the tests you provided:\n\n1. `overlapping([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]) == False`: The sets `{1,2,3,4,5}` and `{6,7,8,9}` are disjoint, so the function returns `True`. However, this is actually False as per the test, which means that the set of values in seq1 is not a subset of the set of values in seq2, and vice versa.\n\n2. `overlapping([1,2,3],[4,5,6]) == False`: The sets `{1,2,3}` and `{4,5,6}` are disjoint, so the function returns `True`. However, this is actually False as per the test, which means that the set of values in seq1 is not a subset of the set of values in seq2, and vice versa.\n\n3. `overlapping([1,4,5],[1,4,5]) == True`: The sets `{1,4,5}` and `{1,4,5}` are not disjoint, so the function returns `False`. However, this is actually True as per the test, which means that the set of values in seq1 is a subset of the set of values in seq2, and vice versa.\n\nHere's the correct code:\n\n```python\ndef overlapping(seq1, seq2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if any value in seq1 exists in seq2.\n    \n    Args:\n        seq1 (list): The list to check for values.\n        seq2 (list): The list to check against.\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if any value in seq1 exists in seq2, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return set(seq1).intersection(set(seq2))\n```\n\nThis code will return a set of common elements between the two sequences, and will return True if there are any common elements.

If the number of factors for a number is odd (i.e., `count_factors(n) % 2!= 0`), we increment the count.\n4.  Finally, we return the count of numbers with odd factors in the range.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\nThe provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness:\n\n```python\nassert count_Odd_Squares(5, 100) == 8\nassert count_Odd_Squares(8, 65) == 6\nassert count_Odd_Squares(2, 5) == 1\n```", "shortest_response": "### Counting Numbers with Odd Factors in a Given Range\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify numbers in a given range that have odd factors.

This would result in a time complexity of O(n).", "shortest_response": "## Equilibrium Index Function\n\nThe equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef equilibrium_index(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the equilibrium index of the given array.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The equilibrium index if it exists, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # Calculate the sum of elements at lower indexes\n        left_sum = sum(arr[:i])\n        \n        # Calculate the sum of elements at higher indexes\n        right_sum = sum(arr[i+1:])\n        \n        # Check if the sums are equal\n        if left_sum == right_sum:\n            return i\n    \n    # If no equilibrium index is found, return -1\n    return -1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis function iterates over each index in the array. For each index, it calculates the sum of elements at lower indexes (`left_sum`) and the sum of elements at higher indexes (`right_sum`).
