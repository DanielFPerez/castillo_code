However, there are several widely recognized systems that are popular among competitive players due to their efficiency, clarity, and effectiveness in communicating information about hand strength and distribution. Here are a few notable bidding systems:\n\n1. **Standard American Yellow Card (SAYC)**: This is one of the most popular bidding systems in North America and many other parts of the world. It's known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it a good choice for beginners and intermediate players looking to improve their game. SAYC includes basic bids, artificial conventions like Stayman and Jacoby transfers, and a framework for handling strong and weak hands.\n\n2. **Precision Club**: A variation of SAYC, Precision emphasizes strong club openings (1\u2663) to denote hands with at least 13 high card points and a five-card or longer club suit. This system aims to improve the accuracy of opening bids and subsequent bidding sequences, particularly when it comes to finding four-card major fits early in the auction.\n\n3. **Two-Over-One Game Forcing (2/1 GF)**: This system is popular in Europe and is known for its aggressive nature and high-scoring potential. In 2/1 GF, overcalls at the two-level are game-forcing, meaning they commit the partnership to play in game if possible. This can lead to more frequent game contracts but also requires careful judgment to avoid overbidding.\n\n4. **Acol**: Widely used in the UK and parts of Europe, Acol is similar to SAYC but with some differences in conventions and treatments. Acol is known for its strong two-bids and the use of transfers, which help in finding the best fit and contract.\n\n5. **Weak Notrump Systems**: These systems, such as those used by top pairs like Eric Rodwell and Matthew Gluck, employ weak notrump openings (e.g., 1NT with a balanced 6-9 HCP range). They are highly sophisticated and require deep understanding and practice, but they can be very effective in competitive bidding situations.\n\nChoosing the \"best\" system involves considering your own strengths and weaknesses as a player, the level of competition you face, and your partner\u2019s compatibility with the system. Many partnerships find success by customizing a standard system to suit their specific needs, incorporating additional conventions and treatments as they become more comfortable with the fundamentals.", "shortest_response": "In duplicate bridge, the term \"best bidding system\" can be subjective and depends largely on the preferences, strengths, and playing styles of the partnership. However, there are several widely recognized and popular bidding systems that many successful players and teams use:\n\n1. **Standard American Yellow Card (SAYC)**: This is one of the most popular bidding systems worldwide. It is relatively simple to learn but offers enough flexibility for experienced players to develop their own nuances and conventions. SAYC is known for its straightforward approach to bidding and its emphasis on natural bids.\n\n2. **Precision Club**: A variant of SAYC, Precision emphasizes strong club openings as a way to show a hand with at least 16 high card points and a balanced distribution. This system is particularly useful for players who want to open more hands and explore a wider range of bidding sequences.\n\n3. **Two Over One Game Forcing (2/1 G/F)**: This system is characterized by a game-forcing response to a partner's opening bid of two of a suit. It requires a strong commitment from both partners to play to game level if possible, making it a powerful tool for competitive bidding scenarios.\n\n4. **Acol System**: Popular in the UK and some other parts of Europe, the Acol system is similar to SAYC but has some differences in the treatment of opening bids and responses. It is known for its emphasis on precision and accuracy in bidding.\n\n5. **Roman Key Card Blackwood**: While not a complete bidding system, this convention is often used in conjunction with others like SAYC or Precision. It provides a method for determining the number of top honors (aces and kings) held by the partnership, which is crucial for deciding whether to bid slam.\n\nThe choice of the \"best\" system will depend on what suits your partnership style, your skill levels, and how well you can adapt to and execute the system's nuances.

Here are some steps and considerations to help you decide what type of dog might be best for you:\n\n1. **Lifestyle Assessment**: Consider your daily routine, living environment, and activity level. Do you live in an apartment or a house with a yard? Are you home most of the day or do you have a busy schedule? The answers to these questions will influence the breed or type of dog that would fit best.\n\n2. **Space and Environment**: Some breeds require more space than others. If you live in a small apartment, a large breed like a Great Dane might not be suitable. Similarly, if you live in a hot climate, consider breeds that don\u2019t overheat easily.\n\n3. **Activity Level**: Think about how much time and energy you can dedicate to exercising your dog. High-energy breeds like Border Collies and Australian Shepherds need lots of exercise and mental stimulation, while lower-energy breeds like Bulldogs or Basset Hounds may be more suited to a less active lifestyle.\n\n4. **Allergies and Shedding**: Consider whether anyone in your household has allergies. Some breeds are hypoallergenic and shed less, such as Poodles or Schnauzers. However, it\u2019s important to note that no breed is completely non-allergenic.\n\n5. **Grooming Needs**: Different breeds have different grooming requirements. Long-haired breeds like Maltese or Shih Tzus require regular brushing and professional grooming, which can be costly and time-consuming.\n\n6. **Temperament and Family Dynamics**: Think about the temperament of the dogs you're considering. Some breeds are better with children and other pets than others. Research the typical behaviors and temperaments of breeds you\u2019re interested in to ensure they align with your family's needs.\n\n7. **Health Concerns**: Certain breeds are prone to specific health issues. For example, Dachshunds often have back problems, and Golden Retrievers are susceptible to hip dysplasia. Understanding these potential health concerns can help you prepare for any veterinary expenses.\n\n8. **Adoption vs. Purchase**: Adopting from a shelter can be a rewarding experience and gives a second chance to a dog in need. Many shelters have dogs of various breeds and mixes, so you can still find a good match without buying from a breeder.\n\n9. **Consultation**: Talk to veterinarians, dog trainers, and experienced dog owners to get insights and advice based on their experiences. They can provide valuable information about the breeds you're considering.\n\n10. **Visit Shelters and Breeders**: Spend time around the types of dogs you\u2019re interested in. Visit shelters, attend dog shows, or visit reputable breeders to observe the behavior and temperament of different breeds.\n\nBy carefully considering these factors, you can make an informed decision about which type of dog will be the best fit for your home and lifestyle.

Here are some steps to help guide you through the decision-making process:\n\n1. **Lifestyle Considerations**: Think about your daily routine and living environment. Are you an active person who enjoys outdoor activities like hiking or running? Or do you prefer a more relaxed lifestyle? Do you live in an apartment, house, or rural area? Your answers will help narrow down breeds that fit well with your lifestyle.\n\n2. **Space and Time Commitment**: Some dogs require more space and exercise than others. For example, larger breeds like Labradors or Retrievers need ample space to move around and regular physical activity. If you have limited space or time, smaller breeds or those that are less energetic might be a better fit.\n\n3. **Allergies and Grooming Needs**: Consider whether anyone in your household has allergies. Some breeds shed less than others, which may be important if allergies are a concern. Also, think about how much time you're willing to spend grooming your dog. Long-haired breeds often require more grooming maintenance than short-haired breeds.\n\n4. **Behavioral Traits**: Research the behavioral traits of different breeds. Some dogs are known for being more social, while others might be more independent. Understanding these traits can help ensure the dog\u2019s personality aligns with your expectations and needs.\n\n5. **Health Concerns**: Certain breeds are predisposed to specific health issues. For example, Bulldogs and Pugs are prone to breathing problems due to their flat faces. Research common health issues associated with various breeds and consider whether you\u2019re prepared to manage these conditions.\n\n6. **Training and Socialization Needs**: Some breeds are easier to train than others. Breeds like Border Collies and German Shepherds are highly intelligent but also require consistent training and mental stimulation. Others, like Beagles, can be stubborn and require patience and consistency in training.\n\n7. **Adoption vs. Purchase**: Adopting from a shelter can be a rewarding experience, as many shelters have dogs of all ages and breeds. If you choose to buy from a breeder, ensure they are reputable and prioritize the health and well-being of their puppies.\n\n8. **Consultation**: Before making a final decision, it can be helpful to consult with veterinarians, dog trainers, or breed clubs.

Hari Seldon, a mathematician and psychologist, has developed psychohistory, a new field of science and psychology that treats all possibilities in large societies by mathematics, allowing for the probabilistic prediction of future events.\n\nBy means of psychohistory, Seldon has discovered the decline and eventual fall of the Empire, angering the aristocratic members of the Commission of Public Safety, the de facto rulers of the Empire. The Commission considers Seldon's views and statements treasonous, and he is arrested along with the young mathematician Gaal Dornick, who has arrived on Trantor to join Seldon's group. Seldon is tried by the Commission; he defends his beliefs, explaining his theories and predictions, including his belief that the Empire will collapse in 300 years and while a Second Empire will eventually rise it will only come after a 30,000-year dark age. He informs the Commission that an alternative to this future is attainable and explains to them that creating a compendium of all human knowledge, the Encyclopedia Galactica, may not prevent the inevitable fall of the Empire but would reduce the dark age to one millennium.\n\nThe skeptical Commission, not wanting to make Seldon a martyr, offers him exile to a remote world, Terminus, with others who could help him create the Encyclopedia. He accepts their offer, prepares for the departure of the \"Encyclopedists\" and receives an imperial decree officially acknowledging his actions. Seldon informs Dornick that, despite the Empire's belief it won by exiling Seldon, the outcome was exactly what he had intended and hoped for.

A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by John of Aviz (later King John I of Portugal) and commanded by General Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira defeated the Castilians in the Battle of Aljubarrota. With this battle, the House of Aviz became the ruling house of Portugal.\n\nThe new ruling dynasty would proceed to push Portugal to the limelight of European politics and culture, creating and sponsoring works of literature, like the Cr\u00f3nicas d'el Rei D. Jo\u00e3o I by Fern\u00e3o Lopes, the first riding and hunting manual Livro da ensinan\u00e7a de bem cavalgar toda sela and O Leal Conselheiro both by King Edward of Portugal and the Portuguese translations of Cicero's De Oficiis and Seneca's De Beneficiis by the well traveled Prince Peter of Coimbra, as well as his magnum opus Tratado da Vertuosa Benfeytoria. In an effort of solidification and centralization of royal power the monarchs of this dynasty also ordered the compilation, organization and publication of the first three compilations of laws in Portugal: the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es d'el Rei D. Duarte, which was never enforced; the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Afonsinas, whose application and enforcement was not uniform across the realm; and the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Manuelinas, which took advantage of the printing press to reach every corner of the kingdom. The Avis Dynasty also sponsored works of architecture like the Mosteiro da Batalha (literally, the Monastery of the Battle) and led to the creation of the manueline style of architecture in the 16th century.\n\nPortugal also spearheaded European exploration of the world and the Age of Discovery. Prince Henry the Navigator, son of King John I of Portugal, became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour. During this period, Portugal explored the Atlantic Ocean, discovering the Atlantic archipelagos the Azores, Madeira, and Cape Verde; explored the African coast; colonized selected areas of Africa; discovered an eastern route to India via the Cape of Good Hope; discovered Brazil, explored the Indian Ocean, established trading routes throughout most of southern Asia; and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to China and Japan.\n\nIn 1415, Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering Ceuta, the first prosperous Islamic trade centre in North Africa. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: Madeira and the Azores, which led to the first colonization movements.\n\nIn 1422, by decree of King John I, Portugal officially abandoned the previous dating system, the Era of Caesar, and adopted the Anno Domini system, therefore becoming the last catholic realm to do so.\n\n\nThroughout the 15th century, Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for several common types of tradable commodities at the time, ranging from gold to slaves, as they looked for a route to India and its spices, which were coveted in Europe.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas, intended to resolve the dispute that had been created following the return of Christopher Columbus, was made by Pope Alexander VI, the mediator between Portugal and Spain. It was signed on 7 June 1494, and divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two countries along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa).\n\n\nIn 1498, Vasco da Gama accomplished what Columbus set out to do and became the first European to reach India by sea, bringing economic prosperity to Portugal and its population of 1.7 million residents, and helping to start the Portuguese Renaissance. In 1500, the Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real reached what is now Canada and founded the town of Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, Newfoundland and Labrador, long before the French and English in the 17th century, and being just one of many Portuguese colonizations of the Americas.\n\nIn 1500, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral discovered Brazil and claimed it for Portugal. Ten years later, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Goa in India, Muscat and Ormuz in the Persian Strait, and Malacca, now a state in Malaysia. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic. Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe, landing in such places as Taiwan, Japan, the island of Timor, and in the Moluccas.\n\nAlthough for a long period it was believed the Dutch were the first Europeans to arrive in Australia, there is also some evidence that the Portuguese may have discovered Australia in 1521. From 1519 to 1522, Ferdinand Magellan (Fern\u00e3o de Magalh\u00e3es) organized a Spanish expedition to the East Indies which resulted in the first circumnavigation of the globe. Magellan never made it back to Europe as he was killed by natives in the Philippines in 1521.\n\nThe Treaty of Zaragoza, signed on 22 April 1529 between Portugal and Spain, specified the anti-meridian to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas.\n\nAll these factors made Portugal one of the world's major economic, military, and political powers from the 15th century until the late 16th century.", "longest_response": "The Treaty of Tordesillas was a significant agreement signed on June 7, 1494, between the Catholic Monarchs of Spain (Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon) and the Kingdom of Portugal, mediated by Pope Alexander VI. This treaty aimed to resolve the dispute over the territories discovered or to be discovered during the Age of Exploration, particularly after Christopher Columbus's voyage in 1492, which brought the Americas into the sphere of European interest.\n\nAccording to the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas, an imaginary meridian line was drawn 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands, off the coast of West Africa. All lands to the east of this line were to be under the control of Portugal, while all lands to the west would belong to Spain. This division allowed Spain to claim the vast majority of the Americas, including present-day Central America, Mexico, and much of South America, while Portugal secured claims to territories such as Brazil, which Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral accidentally discovered in 1500 when his fleet was blown off course en route to India.\n\nThis treaty effectively divided the non-European world between the two Iberian powers, setting the stage for their respective colonial empires. However, the exact location of the line of demarcation was not clearly defined, leading to disputes and negotiations, such as the subsequent Treaty of Zaragoza in 1529, which further clarified the division between Spanish and Portuguese spheres of influence, particularly in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas is considered a pivotal moment in history, as it shaped the geopolitical landscape of the 16th century and beyond, influencing the development of global trade networks and the spread of European influence around the world.", "shortest_response": "The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed on June 7, 1494, was an agreement between the Catholic Monarchs of Spain (Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon) and the Kingdom of Portugal, mediated by Pope Alexander VI.

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how you can develop effective OKRs for your team:\n\n### 1. Understand the Organizational Goals\n- **Review Company-wide OKRs**: Start by understanding the overall objectives of your organization. This ensures that your team's OKRs align with the company\u2019s strategic direction.\n- **Discuss with Stakeholders**: Engage with key stakeholders such as senior management or other department heads to get insights into their expectations and priorities.\n\n### 2. Set Clear Objectives\n- **Define High-Level Goals**: Based on the organizational goals, define 3-5 high-level objectives for your team. These should be ambitious yet achievable.\n- **Make Them Specific**: Each objective should clearly state what you aim to accomplish. Avoid vague terms; instead, use specific language that leaves no room for interpretation.\n- **Ensure Alignment**: Check that each objective aligns with the broader goals of the organization.\n\n### 3. Define Key Results\n- **Quantify Success**: For each objective, define 3-5 key results that will measure whether you have achieved the objective. Key results should be quantitative and time-bound.\n- **Set Stretch Goals**: While it\u2019s important to set achievable goals, also include stretch goals that challenge the team to push beyond their comfort zones.\n- **Keep It Realistic**: Ensure that the key results are attainable within the timeframe and resources available.\n\n### 4. Involve Your Team\n- **Collaborative Development**: Involve your team members in the development process. This not only increases buy-in but also leverages their insights and expertise.\n- **Align Individual OKRs**: Encourage team members to set their own individual OKRs that support the team\u2019s objectives.\n\n### 5. Communicate and Document\n- **Clear Communication**: Once finalized, communicate the OKRs clearly to all team members. Use meetings, emails, or collaboration tools to ensure everyone understands the goals.\n- **Document Everything**: Keep a written record of the OKRs, including objectives and key results, so that there\u2019s a reference point for all team members.\n\n### 6. Monitor Progress Regularly\n- **Regular Check-ins**: Schedule regular check-ins (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to review progress against the key results.\n- **Adjust as Needed**: Be flexible. If circumstances change or if certain objectives become unrealistic, don\u2019t hesitate to adjust them.\n\n### 7. Reflect and Learn\n- **End-of-Period Review**: At the end of the period (usually a quarter), review the achievement of the OKRs. Discuss what went well and what could be improved.\n- **Learn from Failures**: If objectives were not met, use this as a learning opportunity. Analyze why the objectives were missed and adjust strategies accordingly.\n\n### Tools and Resources\nConsider using digital tools like Google Sheets, Asana, or specialized OKR software to manage and track your OKRs. These tools can help streamline the process and make it easier to monitor progress.\n\nBy following these steps, you can develop effective OKRs that not only align your team with the broader organizational goals but also foster a culture of transparency and continuous improvement.", "shortest_response": "Developing Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for your team is a great way to align goals and ensure everyone is working towards the same objectives.

OKRs are designed to set clear, ambitious goals and measure progress toward those goals.\n\n### 2. Align with Company Goals\nStart by understanding the broader company objectives and how your team fits into these. Your team's OKRs should be aligned with the company's strategic priorities.\n\n### 3. Involve Team Members\nEngage your team in the process of setting OKRs. This increases buy-in and ensures that the objectives are realistic and achievable within the context of your team's capabilities and resources.\n\n### 4. Set Clear Objectives\nObjectives should be qualitative, inspiring, and ambitious. They should reflect what you aim to achieve over a specific period (typically quarterly or annually).\n\n### 5. Define Key Results\nFor each objective, define 2-5 key results that are quantitative and measurable. These should clearly indicate progress towards the objective. Make sure they are challenging yet achievable.\n\n### 6. Review and Refine\nOnce initial drafts of OKRs are proposed, review them with the team to ensure clarity, feasibility, and alignment. Be open to refining objectives and key results based on feedback.\n\n### 7. Communicate OKRs\nClearly communicate the finalized OKRs to all team members. Ensure everyone understands their role and how their work contributes to achieving the objectives.\n\n### 8. Track Progress\nSet up a regular check-in schedule (weekly or bi-weekly) to track progress against key results. Use this time to discuss challenges, successes, and any adjustments needed.\n\n### 9. Adjust as Necessary\nBe flexible. If circumstances change, don\u2019t hesitate to adjust OKRs to better reflect current realities. This could mean changing key results or even the objectives themselves.\n\n### 10. Reflect and Learn\nAt the end of the OKR cycle, conduct a review session. Discuss what was achieved, what wasn't, and why.

HDFS is designed to store very large files across multiple machines, providing high throughput access to application data. It provides features like fault tolerance, replication, and scalability.\n\n2. **MapReduce**: This is a programming model and software framework for writing applications that process vast amounts of data in parallel on large clusters of commodity hardware. MapReduce programs are composed of a map() function that performs filtering and sorting (such as sorting students by first name into queues, one queue for each name) and a reduce() function that performs a summary operation (such as counting the number of students with each name).\n\n3. **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)**: YARN is a resource management platform responsible for managing computing resources in clusters and using them for scheduling users' jobs.

It is not mentioned in encyclopedias and dictionaries of the 1970s, first appearing in an Italian dictionary in 1980, and in English in 1982. It is mentioned in a 1983 cookbook devoted to cooking of the Veneto.\n\nObituaries for the restaurateur Ado Campeol (1928\u20132021) reported that it was invented at his restaurant Le Beccherie in Treviso on 24 December 1969 by his wife Alba di Pillo (1929\u20132021) and the pastry chef Roberto Linguanotto. The dish was added to its menu in 1972. Accounts by Carminantonio Iannaccone claim the tiramisu sold at Le Beccherie was made by him in his bakery, created on 24 December 1969.\n\nIt has been claimed that tiramisu has aphrodisiac effects and was concocted by a 19th-century Treviso brothel madam, as the Accademia Del Tiramis\u00f9 explains, to \"solve the problems they may have had with their conjugal duties on their return to their wives\".\n\nThere is evidence of a \"Tiremes\u00f9\" semi-frozen dessert served by the Vetturino restaurant in Pieris, in the Friuli Venezia Giulia, since 1938. This may be the name's origin, while the recipe for Tiramisu may have originated as a variation of another layered dessert, Zuppa Inglese. Others claim it was created towards the end of the 17th century in Siena in honour of Grand Duke Cosimo III.\n\nOn 29 July 2017, Tiramisu was entered by the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies on the list of traditional Friulian and Giulian agri-food products in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region.

This classic version does not include chocolate or strawberries directly in the recipe, although toppings or garnishes might vary.\n\nWhen considering a Tiramisu with chocolate, this usually means incorporating chocolate into the traditional recipe, either through the addition of chocolate chips, a layer of chocolate sauce, or even a chocolate-infused cream. Chocolate can add richness and depth to the dessert, complementing the coffee and mascarpone flavors.\n\nOn the other hand, a Tiramisu with strawberries often involves using fresh strawberries to provide a burst of fruity sweetness. This variation can be particularly refreshing and appealing to those who prefer a lighter, fruitier dessert.\n\nGiven the context you've provided about the traditional origins and composition of Tiramisu, it's worth noting that the EU Protected Status certification for Tiramisu, sought by the governor of Veneto, aims to protect the authenticity of the dessert based on its original ingredients. This implies that variations with strawberries or chocolate might not be considered 'traditional' Tiramisu according to this certification.\n\nUltimately, whether Tiramisu with chocolate or strawberries is better is subjective.

On the other hand, adding strawberries can bring a fresh, fruity twist to the dessert, potentially balancing out the creaminess and coffee flavors with a hint of sweetness and acidity from the berries.\n\nIf you're looking for a dessert that adheres closely to the traditional Italian recipe, you might prefer the original tiramisu without these additions.

Here\u2019s a general guide on how to approach this decision:\n\n### 1. **Understand Your League Settings**\n   - **Scoring System:** Know whether your league uses standard scoring or PPR (Points Per Reception). In PPR leagues, wide receivers tend to score more frequently.\n   - **Starting Lineup Requirements:** Some leagues allow multiple flex slots, while others have only one. This can affect how you prioritize positions.\n\n### 2. **Evaluate Player Performance**\n   - **Current Form:** Look at recent performances. A player who has been consistently scoring should be prioritized over one with inconsistent stats.\n   - **Injuries and Suspensions:** Check for any injuries or suspensions that could affect a player's availability.\n\n### 3. **Consider Positional Scarcity**\n   - **Running Backs (RB):** Often high-scoring due to rushing yards and touchdowns, but they can be risky because of the potential for high workloads leading to injuries.\n   - **Wide Receivers (WR):** Especially valuable in PPR leagues. They can provide steady points through receptions and are less likely to get injured compared to running backs.\n   - **Tight Ends (TE):** Historically lower-scoring than RBs and WRs, but certain tight ends have become more like receiving threats similar to wide receivers, especially in modern offenses.\n\n### 4. **Matchups and Schedules**\n   - **Defensive Strength:** Consider the strength of the defense your player will face. For instance, a weak run defense might make it easier for a running back to gain yards and score.\n   - **Game Location:** Home games often favor the home team, which could give an edge to players on the home team.\n\n### 5. **Flex Slot Strategy**\n   - **Risk Management:** If you already have strong players at RB and WR, consider using your flex spot to fill a need, such as a solid TE.\n   - **Versatility:** Sometimes, having a versatile option (like a WR who can also catch passes) can provide flexibility depending on matchups and injuries.\n\n### Example Scenario:\nIf your league is PPR and you have a strong running back and a decent wide receiver, you might lean towards a tight end or another wide receiver for your flex spot. However, if your running back is underperforming or injured, a reliable running back could be a better choice.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all answer to what position is best for the flex slot; it depends heavily on the context of your league and your team\u2019s needs. Regularly reviewing these factors and adjusting your strategy accordingly can help maximize your chances of success.", "shortest_response": "Choosing the best position for your Fantasy Football flex slot depends on several factors including your league settings, scoring system, and the specific players available. However, here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Wide Receivers (WR)**: In many leagues, wide receivers are the most popular choice for the flex position due to their consistent scoring potential. They can score through receptions, rushing yards, and touchdowns.\n\n2. **Running Backs (RB)**: Running backs are another strong option for the flex position, especially those who are involved in both rushing and receiving plays. They tend to be more consistent week-to-week compared to wide receivers.\n\n3. **Tight Ends (TE)**: Tight ends can be a solid choice if they are involved heavily in the passing game. Some tight ends have emerged as top fantasy options, particularly in PPR (Points Per Reception) leagues where receptions are highly valued.\n\n### Considerations:\n- **League Scoring System**: If your league uses PPR scoring, wide receivers and tight ends might be more valuable because of the points awarded for receptions.\n- **Player Availability**: If you already have strong running back options in your starting lineup, it might make sense to fill your flex with a receiver or tight end.\n- **Injuries and Bye Weeks**: Plan ahead for bye weeks and injuries. Having a versatile roster that includes multiple options at different positions can help mitigate these issues.\n\n### Strategy Tips:\n- **Depth**: Maintain depth across all positions so you have quality backups and flex options.\n- **Matchups**: Consider upcoming matchups when deciding which player to start in your flex slot. A receiver or running back facing a weak defense could be a better choice than a stronger player facing a tough defensive matchup.\n\nUltimately, the best position to use in your flex slot will depend on the specific circumstances of your league and the current state of your team.", "input_size": 42, "output_sizes": [520, 487, 591, 398, 416, 444, 429, 376, 449, 481], "output_mean": 459.1, "output_std": 60.08, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 419.25, "p50": 446.5, "p75": 485.5, "p99": 584.61}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "open_qa", "gen_time": 41.88012}, {"sample_id": "f058ba38d7da5b4e", "prompt_id": "f0e5f19b6bab8ecc", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What is a dwarf planet ?", "longest_response": "A dwarf planet is a category of celestial body orbiting the Sun that is large enough to have taken on a nearly round shape due to its own gravity but has not cleared its neighboring region of other objects.

Design and Planning\n- **Conceptualize the Design**: Decide on the size, shape, and type of plane (glider, powered, etc.).\n- **Draw Blueprints**: Sketch detailed plans including dimensions, aerodynamics, and structural integrity.\n\n#### 2. Construct the Internal Frame\n- **Frame Construction**: Use lightweight materials like balsa wood or carbon fiber to build the basic frame. This includes the fuselage, wing spars, and tail section.\n- **Reinforcement**: Ensure the frame is strong enough to support the duct tape exterior and any additional weight like motors or electronics.\n\n#### 3. Add Control Surfaces\n- **Attach Control Surfaces**: Install rudders, elevators, and ailerons on the tail and wings. These should be made from the same lightweight material as the frame.\n\n#### 4. Covering with Duct Tape\n- **Fuselage**: Start wrapping the duct tape around the fuselage frame. Overlap the tape slightly to ensure a smooth surface. You may need to use a heat gun to mold the tape into a more aerodynamic shape.\n- **Wings**: Similarly, cover the wings with duct tape. Ensure the covering is tight and smooth to minimize drag.\n- **Tail Section**: Cover the tail section, ensuring that control surfaces are still functional.\n\n#### 5. Motor and Propeller Installation (if applicable)\n- **Mount Motors**: Secure motors to the wings or fuselage, depending on your design.\n- **Install Propellers**: Attach propellers to the motors.\n\n#### 6. Wiring and Electronics\n- **Electrical Setup**: Wire up the motors, control surfaces, and any electronic components like a remote control receiver. Ensure all connections are secure and insulated.\n\n#### 7. Final Touches\n- **Seal Any Gaps**: Use more duct tape to seal any gaps or openings in the fuselage or wings.\n- **Test Fit**: Check the aerodynamics and functionality of the control surfaces.\n\n### Considerations:\n- **Aerodynamics**: Ensure the design adheres to principles of aerodynamics for stability and flight capability.\n- **Weight**: Keep the overall weight as low as possible to enhance performance.\n- **Safety**: If planning to fly the plane, ensure all safety measures are followed, especially if using motors and electronics.\n\nThis project is more suited for a model aircraft or a large-scale art installation rather than a practical flying machine due to the limitations of duct tape in terms of durability and strength under stress.

Wrap duct tape around the frame, starting from one end and working your way to the other. Overlap each strip slightly to ensure there are no gaps.\n   - Smooth out any wrinkles or bubbles in the tape as you go along.\n   - Once the entire fuselage is covered, reinforce it by adding additional layers of tape if necessary.\n\n4. **Creating the Wings:**\n   - Construct the wings using the same method as the fuselage. Attach the wings to the fuselage using more duct tape to ensure they are secure.\n   - Make sure the wings are positioned correctly to maintain balance.\n\n5. **Adding Details:**\n   - Add any additional details such as the tail section, cockpit, or landing gear using the duct tape.\n   - You can also use different colors of duct tape to add some aesthetic appeal.\n\n6. **Finishing Touches:**\n   - Trim any excess tape to make the plane look neat.\n   - If desired, add decorative elements like stickers or paint to enhance the appearance.\n\n### Important Notes:\n- This project is best suited for a non-functional model or decoration rather than something intended to fly.\n- The structural integrity of a duct tape plane is very limited, so it should not be subjected to any significant stress or impact.\n- For educational purposes or fun projects, this can be a creative and engaging activity.\n\nRemember, while duct tape is versatile and strong in certain applications, it lacks the necessary properties for building a functional aircraft.

The earliest known video game Easter egg is in Moonlander (1973), in which the player tries to land a Lunar module on the moon; if the player opts to fly the module horizontally through several of the game's screens, they encounter a McDonald's restaurant, and if they land next to it the astronaut will visit it instead of standing next to the ship. The earliest known Easter egg in software in general is one placed in the \"make\" command for PDP-6/PDP-10 computers sometime in October 1967\u2013October 1968, wherein if the user attempts to create a file named \"love\" by typing \"make love\", the program responds \"not war?\" before proceeding.", "longest_response": "The concept of Easter eggs in video games and other forms of media has its roots in the tradition of an Easter egg hunt, where participants search for hidden eggs during the Christian holiday of Easter. In the context of video games and software, an Easter egg refers to a hidden feature, message, or content that developers embed within their creations as a form of inside joke, tribute, or simply to provide users with a surprise.\n\nThe term \"Easter egg\" as applied to hidden features in software was popularized around 1979 by Steve Wright, who was the Director of Software Development at Atari at the time. Wright coined the term in relation to a hidden message in the Atari video game \"Adventure.\" However, while Wright's contribution is significant in naming the phenomenon, Easter eggs existed in digital media even before this time.\n\nOne of the earliest known examples of an Easter egg in a video game can be found in \"Moonlander,\" released in 1973. In this game, players control a lunar module attempting to land safely on the moon's surface. If the player navigates the module horizontally across several screens, they encounter an unexpected sight: a McDonald's restaurant. Landing near this location causes the astronaut character to walk over and visit the restaurant rather than standing next to the module as usual. This quirky feature is considered one of the first Easter eggs in video games.\n\nEven earlier than this, in the realm of software, there exists an Easter egg in the \"make\" command for PDP-6/PDP-10 computers, dating back to some time between October 1967 and October 1968. When a user attempts to create a file named \"love\" by entering \"make love,\" the system responds with \"not war?\" before continuing. This early example demonstrates the playful nature of programmers and their desire to leave behind humorous or thought-provoking messages for those savvy enough to find them.\n\nThus, the tradition of Easter eggs in video games and software began as a way for creators to add a personal touch to their work and entertain users who took the time to explore beyond the expected functionalities. Over time, Easter eggs have become a common practice, evolving from simple jokes and surprises to more complex and integrated elements that enhance the overall experience of the product.", "shortest_response": "The concept of Easter eggs in video games and software has its roots in playful and creative expressions by developers who wanted to hide surprises for observant users.

Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995, Vapnik et al., 1997[citation needed]) SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods, being based on statistical learning frameworks or VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974). Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n\nIn addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\nThe support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data.[citation needed] These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data to groups and, then, to map new data according to these clusters.", "longest_response": "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning model used in machine learning for classification and regression tasks. The concept was developed primarily by Vladimir Vapnik and his colleagues at AT&T Bell Laboratories in the early 1990s. SVMs are known for their robustness and efficiency in solving complex problems, especially when dealing with high-dimensional spaces.\n\n### Key Concepts of SVM\n\n- **Classification**: SVMs are primarily used for classification, where the goal is to separate different classes of data points. It does this by finding a hyperplane in the feature space that distinctly classifies the data points.\n  \n- **Maximizing Margin**: SVM aims to maximize the margin between different classes. This margin is defined as the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data point from any class. By maximizing this margin, SVM tries to achieve better generalization to unseen data.\n\n- **Support Vectors**: The data points that are closest to the hyperplane and define the margin are called support vectors. These points are crucial in determining the optimal hyperplane. If any other data points are removed or altered, the position of the hyperplane would not change.\n\n- **Kernel Trick**: One of the powerful features of SVMs is their ability to handle non-linearly separable data through the use of kernels. A kernel function transforms the input data into a higher-dimensional space where a linear separation might be possible. Common kernels include the polynomial kernel, radial basis function (RBF) kernel, and sigmoid kernel.\n\n- **Types of SVMs**:\n  - **Linear SVM**: Used for data that is linearly separable.\n  - **Non-linear SVM**: Uses the kernel trick to handle non-linear separable data.\n\n### Applications of SVM\n\nSVMs have been widely applied across various fields due to their effectiveness in handling complex datasets:\n\n- **Bioinformatics**: For gene classification and protein classification.\n- **Text Categorization**: Classifying documents into predefined categories.\n- **Image Recognition**: Identifying objects within images.\n- **Handwriting Recognition**: Recognizing handwritten characters and digits.\n\n### Advantages and Limitations\n\n**Advantages**:\n- Effective in high-dimensional spaces.\n- Still effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n- Uses a subset of training points (support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n- Versatile: Different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function.\n\n**Limitations**:\n- If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial.\n- SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, which are computed using an expensive five-fold cross-validation.\n\nUnderstanding SVMs requires knowledge of concepts like margins, hyperplanes, and kernels, but once understood, SVMs can be a powerful tool in the machine learning toolkit.", "shortest_response": "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning model used in machine learning for classification and regression tasks.

This way, when you read the data into Spark, you can parse this timestamp and use it in your stream processing.\n\n2. **Using `current_timestamp()` Function:** If you need to add a timestamp at the moment of processing, you can use the `current_timestamp()` function in Spark SQL. This function returns the current timestamp when the query is executed. For example, you could add a new column to your DataFrame with the current timestamp like so:\n\n   ```python\n   from pyspark.sql import functions as F\n\n   # Assuming df is your DataFrame\n   df = df.withColumn(\"processing_time\", F.current_timestamp())\n   ```\n\n3. **Event Time Processing:** In scenarios where you want to perform operations based on the event time (the time when the event actually happened), you can designate one of the columns as the event time watermark. This allows you to perform operations like windowing based on the event time rather than the processing time.\n\nHere's an example of how you might set up a watermark and use event time in a structured streaming application:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, current_timestamp, expr\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StringType, TimestampType\n\n# Create Spark session\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"StructuredStreamingExample\").getOrCreate()\n\n# Define schema for input data\nschema = StructType().add(\"event_time\", TimestampType()).add(\"value\", StringType())\n\n# Read from a source (e.g., Kafka)\ndf = spark.readStream.format(\"kafka\") \\\n    .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", \"host:port\") \\\n    .option(\"subscribe\", \"topic\") \\\n    .load() \\\n    .selectExpr(\"CAST(value AS STRING)\") \\\n    .select(from_json(col(\"value\"), schema).alias(\"data\")) \\\n    .select(\"data.*\")\n\n# Set watermark for event_time column\ndf = df.withWatermark(\"event_time\", \"10 minutes\")\n\n# Perform some operation, e.g., count events per 5-minute window\nwindowedCounts = df.groupBy(\n    window(col(\"event_time\"), \"5 minutes\"),\n    col(\"value\")\n).count()\n\nquery = windowedCounts.writeStream.outputMode(\"complete\").format(\"console\").start()\n\nquery.awaitTermination()\n```\n\nIn this example, `event_time` is used as the event time column, and a watermark is set to handle late data.

This expansion and contraction can cause connections to loosen over time, leading to increased resistance at connection points such as outlets, switches, and splices. Increased resistance leads to heating, which can cause fires.\n\n2. **Galvanic Corrosion**: When aluminum wires are connected to devices or other metals that are not compatible (such as brass or steel), galvanic corrosion can occur. This corrosion can degrade the connection over time, increasing resistance and the risk of overheating and fire.\n\n3. **Mechanical Properties**: Aluminum is softer and more malleable than copper, making it easier to damage during installation or maintenance. Damage to the wire can lead to exposed conductors, which pose an electrical shock hazard and can also cause fires.\n\n4. **Lack of Proper Termination Techniques**: Older homes with aluminum wiring may have been wired without the proper connectors or techniques required to safely connect aluminum wires to devices designed for copper wiring. Modern solutions include using special connectors (CO-ALR rated) and methods that are designed to mitigate the risks associated with aluminum wiring.\n\n5. **Historical Context**: The dangers associated with aluminum wiring became apparent in the 1970s after a significant number of house fires were traced back to faulty aluminum wiring connections. As a result, many building codes were revised to limit or prohibit its use in residential settings.\n\nIf you suspect your home has aluminum wiring, it's important to consult with a qualified electrician who can assess the safety of the wiring and recommend any necessary remediation measures. In some cases, the wiring might need to be replaced entirely, but often, the installation of specialized connectors can significantly reduce the risk of fires.", "shortest_response": "Aluminum wiring used in homes can be dangerous for several reasons, primarily due to its physical and electrical properties compared to copper wiring:\n\n1. **Expansion and Contraction**: Aluminum expands more than copper when it heats up.

This corrosion can degrade the connection, leading to increased resistance and potential overheating.\n\n3. **Creep**: Aluminum has a property called \"creep,\" which means it can slowly deform under pressure over time. In electrical connections, this deformation can lead to loose connections, which can become hot spots and increase the risk of fire.\n\n4. **Oxidation**: Aluminum oxidizes quickly upon exposure to air, forming an insulating oxide layer on the surface of the wire. While this oxide layer can protect the wire from further corrosion, it can also increase electrical resistance at connections, potentially causing them to overheat.\n\n5. **Improper Installation**: Many issues with aluminum wiring arise from improper installation techniques. Older installations might not have been done according to modern standards that account for aluminum's unique properties.\n\nFor these reasons, aluminum wiring was eventually phased out in residential construction in favor of copper wiring, which is less prone to these issues.

He was the first Vice President of the United States under George Washington, serving two terms from 1789 to 1797. In 1796, Adams was elected as the second President of the United States, succeeding Washington. His presidency was marked by tensions with France, which led to an undeclared naval war known as the Quasi-War.

Here are some of the key benefits of using GM crops:\n\n1. **Increased Yield**: One of the primary goals of genetic modification is to increase crop yields. This can be achieved by enhancing the plant's ability to resist pests and diseases, which can otherwise reduce yield. Additionally, GM crops can be engineered to grow in harsher conditions, such as drought or poor soil quality, thereby increasing their resilience and output.\n\n2. **Pest Resistance**: Many GM crops are designed with built-in resistance to certain pests, reducing the need for chemical pesticides. This not only decreases the environmental impact but also reduces the cost of pest control for farmers. For example, Bt corn produces a toxin that is toxic to specific pests but safe for humans and other non-target organisms.\n\n3. **Herbicide Tolerance**: Some GM crops are engineered to be resistant to herbicides, allowing farmers to apply these chemicals to control weeds without harming the crops themselves. This can lead to more effective weed management and reduced tillage, which helps in preserving soil health and reducing erosion.\n\n4. **Disease Resistance**: Genetic modification can help crops fight off diseases that would normally devastate them. By incorporating genes from other organisms that confer disease resistance, GM crops can thrive in environments where traditional varieties would fail.\n\n5. **Nutritional Enhancement**: GM technology can be used to enhance the nutritional content of crops. For example, \"Golden Rice\" has been genetically modified to produce beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A. This addresses deficiencies in regions where rice is a staple food and vitamin A deficiency is prevalent.\n\n6. **Reduced Environmental Impact**: By reducing the need for chemical inputs like pesticides and herbicides, GM crops can contribute to a decrease in the environmental footprint of farming. Less tillage due to herbicide-tolerant crops can also help in carbon sequestration and soil conservation.\n\n7. **Economic Benefits**: The combination of higher yields, lower input costs, and reduced labor requirements can result in significant economic benefits for farmers. Additionally, GM crops can open up new markets for crops that are resistant to certain pests or diseases that are prevalent in particular regions.\n\n8. **Sustainability**: GM crops can contribute to sustainable agriculture practices by improving resource use efficiency and reducing waste. They can also help in adapting to climate change by developing traits that allow crops to withstand extreme weather conditions.\n\nWhile these benefits highlight the potential of GM crops, it's important to consider the broader context, including regulatory frameworks, ethical considerations, and the importance of ongoing research to ensure safety and efficacy.", "shortest_response": "Genetically modified (GM) crops have been developed to enhance various traits that can benefit agriculture and food production in several ways. Here are some of the key benefits:\n\n1. **Increased Yield**: GM crops are often engineered to resist pests, diseases, and environmental stresses like drought or salinity, which can lead to higher yields under adverse conditions.\n\n2. **Pest Resistance**: Some GM crops produce their own pesticides, reducing the need for chemical sprays. This can lower costs for farmers and reduce environmental pollution from pesticide runoff.\n\n3. **Herbicide Tolerance**: Certain GM crops are designed to tolerate specific herbicides, allowing farmers to control weeds more effectively without harming the crop. This can reduce labor costs and increase efficiency in weed management.\n\n4. **Disease Resistance**: By introducing genes that confer resistance to specific plant viruses, bacteria, or fungi, GM crops can prevent significant yield losses due to disease outbreaks.\n\n5. **Improved Nutrition**: Genetic modification can enhance the nutritional content of crops, such as increasing vitamin levels or improving protein quality, which can help address malnutrition in populations that rely heavily on staple crops.\n\n6. **Reduced Environmental Impact**: By reducing the need for chemical inputs like pesticides and herbicides, GM crops can contribute to a reduction in soil and water contamination. Additionally, some GM crops are engineered to require less water or to grow in poorer soils, reducing pressure on natural resources.\n\n7. **Economic Benefits**: Farmers who adopt GM crops often report economic benefits, including reduced input costs (e.g., for pesticides), increased yields, and greater marketability of their products.\n\n8. **Sustainability**: The ability of GM crops to grow in harsher conditions or with fewer resources can contribute to sustainable agricultural practices, helping to meet the growing global demand for food while minimizing environmental impact.\n\nWhile these benefits highlight the potential advantages of GM crops, it's also important to consider the broader context, including ethical considerations, regulatory frameworks, and the potential for unintended ecological impacts.

This means that public education is generally free for students.\n   - **Private Schools:** These are funded through tuition fees paid by parents, donations, and sometimes endowments or other financial support from religious organizations or private entities.\n\n2. **Administration:**\n   - **Public Schools:** They are governed by school boards or educational authorities appointed by the government. Curriculum and standards are set at the state level, ensuring a certain uniformity across the region.\n   - **Private Schools:** These are independently managed, often by a board of trustees or directors. They have more autonomy in setting their own rules, regulations, and curricula, which can be tailored to specific educational philosophies or religious beliefs.\n\n3. **Curriculum Flexibility:**\n   - **Public Schools:** The curriculum is typically standardized and must adhere to state or national education standards. While there is some room for variation, especially in elective courses, the core subjects and learning outcomes are prescribed.\n   - **Private Schools:** Have more freedom to design their curricula according to their mission and values. This can include offering specialized programs in areas like arts, sciences, or religious studies.\n\n4. **Admission Policies:**\n   - **Public Schools:** Generally, students are admitted based on where they live, with attendance zones determined by the district. Public schools do not usually require entrance exams or interviews.\n   - **Private Schools:** Admission criteria vary widely among private institutions. Some may require entrance exams, interviews, or have selective enrollment policies based on academic performance, extracurricular activities, or other criteria.\n\n5. **Cost:**\n   - **Public Schools:** As mentioned, these are typically free to attend, though there might be costs associated with materials, field trips, and extracurricular activities.\n   - **Private Schools:** Tuition can be quite high, making them less accessible to families without significant financial resources. However, many private schools offer scholarships and financial aid to help cover tuition costs.\n\n6. **Class Size and Resources:**\n   - **Public Schools:** Class sizes can vary but are often larger due to budget constraints. Resource allocation also depends heavily on the available funding.\n   - **Private Schools:** Often have smaller class sizes and can provide more individualized attention. They might also have better access to resources like technology, facilities, and extracurricular activities due to their independent funding sources.\n\nEach type of school has its advantages and may be better suited to different needs and preferences.

This means that they have to adhere to certain guidelines set by educational authorities.\n   - **Private Schools**: They are funded through tuition fees, donations, and sometimes endowments. Private schools may also receive some government grants but generally operate with more financial independence.\n\n2. **Administration**:\n   - **Public Schools**: They are governed by state or national educational boards and must comply with specific regulations regarding teacher qualifications, curriculum, and student testing.\n   - **Private Schools**: These institutions have more autonomy in how they are run, including hiring practices, curriculum development, and discipline policies. However, they often need to meet accreditation standards set by independent bodies.\n\n3. **Curriculum Flexibility**:\n   - **Public Schools**: The curriculum is typically more standardized and must align with state or national educational standards.\n   - **Private Schools**: Have more flexibility in choosing their curriculum and can tailor it to reflect their mission, whether it\u2019s religious, specialized (like STEM), or focused on specific learning styles.\n\n4. **Admission Policies**:\n   - **Public Schools**: Generally must accept all students within their geographic district without any selection process.\n   - **Private Schools**: Can choose their students based on academic performance, interviews, or other criteria. Some may have waiting lists or be selective about admissions.\n\n5. **Tuition Fees**:\n   - **Public Schools**: Typically do not charge tuition fees for residents within their district, although there might be additional costs for activities or materials.\n   - **Private Schools**: Require tuition payments from parents, which can vary widely depending on the school and its resources.\n\n6. **Religious Affiliation**:\n   - **Public Schools**: Cannot promote or endorse any particular religion; they must remain secular.\n   - **Private Schools**: Many private schools are affiliated with religious organizations and may include religious education as part of their curriculum.\n\nThese differences highlight the varied options available to families when choosing an educational path for their children, each with its own advantages and considerations.", "input_size": 39, "output_sizes": [537, 581, 524, 572, 563, 512, 488, 461, 537, 470], "output_mean": 524.5, "output_std": 39.67, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 494.0, "p50": 530.5, "p75": 556.5, "p99": 580.19}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 41.01822}, {"sample_id": "97e28ed89312f304", "prompt_id": "47bd8f1f810fc36d", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Who is Barack Obama?\nContext: Barack Hussein Obama II (/b\u0259\u02c8r\u0251\u02d0k hu\u02d0\u02c8se\u026an o\u028a\u02c8b\u0251\u02d0m\u0259/ (listen) b\u0259-RAHK hoo-SAYN oh-BAH-m\u0259; born August 4, 1961) is an American former politician who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017.

List in the format {name} - {year} in a semicolon list.\nContext: Radiohead are an English rock band formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.\n\nRadiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in 1993. Their debut single, \"Creep\", became a worldwide hit. Radiohead's popularity and critical standing rose with the release of The Bends in 1995. Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music.\n\nRadiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though Kid A divided listeners, it was later named the best album of the decade by multiple outlets. It was followed by Amnesiac (2001), recorded in the same sessions. Hail to the Thief (2003), with lyrics addressing the War on Terror, blended the band's rock and electronic sides, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI.\n\nRadiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway, and O'Brien have released solo albums; in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.\n\nBy 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart: \"Creep\" (1992), \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" (1996), \"Paranoid Android\" (1997), \"Karma Police\" (1997), \"No Surprises\" (1998), \"Pyramid Song\" (2001), and \"There There\" (2003). \"Creep\" and \"Nude\" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Rolling Stone named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and Rolling Stone readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s. Five Radiohead albums have been included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time lists.

It helps project managers and stakeholders to estimate the effort, cost, and schedule required for software development projects based on the size of the software, typically measured in lines of code or function points.\n\nCOCOMO operates under the principle that larger software systems tend to have higher costs and longer development times than smaller ones, but not necessarily in a linear fashion. This means that doubling the size of a software system does not necessarily double its cost or development time.\n\nThere are different versions of COCOMO, with the most notable being COCOMO 81 and COCOMO II:\n\n1. **COCOMO 81**: This was the original version, published in 1981. It uses a basic formula to estimate effort based on the size of the software in lines of code. It includes three levels of models: Basic, Intermediate, and Detailed. The Basic model provides a simple estimation, while the Intermediate and Detailed models incorporate additional factors such as hardware limitations, personnel experience, and programming language quality.\n\n2. **COCOMO II**: An updated version released in 2000, which improved upon COCOMO 81 by incorporating more modern practices and considerations. COCOMO II uses function points instead of lines of code for estimating size and includes a broader range of cost drivers and risk factors. It also offers a web-based tool for performing these estimations, making it more accessible to users.\n\nBoth versions of COCOMO rely on empirical data from past projects to calibrate their formulas. For instance, COCOMO 81 was calibrated using data from 63 projects, whereas COCOMO II was calibrated using data from 163 projects, providing a more robust basis for estimation.\n\nWhile COCOMO provides valuable insights and can be quite accurate when applied correctly, it's important to note that like any predictive model, its accuracy can be influenced by various factors, including the quality of input data and the specific characteristics of the project being estimated.", "shortest_response": "The Constructive Cost Model, or COCOMO, is a widely recognized model used in software project management to estimate the cost and effort required to develop software. It was developed by Barry W.

The model parameters are derived from historical data collected from previous software development projects. For COCOMO 81, this data was based on 63 projects, while COCOMO II used data from 163 projects to refine its estimations.\n\nCOCOMO II, in particular, offers more flexibility and accuracy compared to its predecessor by considering various cost drivers that can influence the project's complexity and thus its cost. These cost drivers include product attributes (such as required reliability and size of the database), hardware attributes (such as execution time constraints), personnel attributes (like experience and capability), and project attributes (such as schedule constraints).\n\nBy taking into account these variables, COCOMO helps project managers and stakeholders make informed decisions regarding budgeting, resource allocation, and timelines for software development projects.", "input_size": 101, "output_sizes": [368, 374, 407, 351, 423, 274, 285, 354, 366, 435], "output_mean": 363.7, "output_std": 50.1, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 351.75, "p50": 367.0, "p75": 398.75, "p99": 433.92}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "summarization", "gen_time": 30.65417}, {"sample_id": "491887d10f16b619", "prompt_id": "40bdf588338bce81", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What is the database?", "longest_response": "A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and managed electronically.

It is an example of cannibalization.\nThe term alludes to the Osborne Computer Corporation, whose second product did not become available until more than a year after it was announced. The company's subsequent bankruptcy was widely blamed on reduced sales after the announcement.\nThe Osborne Effect states that prematurely discussing future, unavailable products damages sales of existing products. The name comes from the planned replacement of the Osborne 1, an early personal computer first sold by the Osborne Computer Corporation in 1981. In 1983, founder Adam Osborne pre-announced several next-generation computer models (the Osborne Executive and Osborne Vixen), which were only prototypes, highlighting the fact that they would outperform the existing model as the prototypes dramatically cut down assembly time. A widely held belief was that sales of the Osborne 1 fell sharply as customers anticipated those more advanced systems, leading to a sales decline from which Osborne Computer was unable to recover. This belief appeared in the media almost immediately after the company's September 1983 bankruptcy:\n\nTo give the jazzy $2,495 Osborne Executive a running start, Adam began orchestrating publicity early in 1983. We, along with many other magazines, were shown the machine in locked hotel rooms. We were required not to have anything in print about it until the planned release date in mid-April. As far as we know, nothing did appear in print, but dealers heard about the plans and cancelled orders for the Osborne 1 in droves. In early April, Osborne told dealers he would be showing them the machine on a one-week tour the week of 17 April, and emphasized that the new machine was not a competitor for the Osborne 1. But dealers didn't react the way Osborne expected; said Osborne, \"All of them just cancelled their orders for the Osborne 1.\"\n\nOsborne reacted by drastically cutting prices on the Osborne 1 in an effort to stimulate cash flow. But nothing seemed to work, and for several months sales were practically non-existent.\n\nPre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, with the revenue drop for the current product being offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available. However, when the Osborne effect occurs, the quantity of unsold goods increases and the company must react by discounting and/or lowering production of the current product, both of which depress cash flow.", "longest_response": "From the passage provided, the price of the Osborne 1 was reduced due to the pre-announcement of newer models, but its original price is not explicitly stated.

Here's why chlorophyll gives plants their green color:\n\n1. **Absorption of Light**: Chlorophyll primarily absorbs red and blue wavelengths of light from the sunlight spectrum. These wavelengths are at opposite ends of the visible light spectrum. Red light has longer wavelengths and lower energy, while blue light has shorter wavelengths and higher energy.\n\n2. **Reflection of Green Light**: Since chlorophyll absorbs mostly red and blue light, it reflects green light back to our eyes. This is why we see plants as green. The human eye perceives the reflected green light as the dominant color of the plant.\n\n3. **Efficiency in Photosynthesis**: The absorption of red and blue light by chlorophyll is highly efficient for photosynthesis. Plants have evolved to maximize their ability to capture these wavelengths, which are abundant in sunlight. By absorbing more red and blue light, plants can efficiently convert this light into energy necessary for growth and survival.\n\n4. **Adaptation to Sunlight Spectrum**: The Earth's atmosphere scatters short-wavelength light more than long-wavelength light (this is why the sky appears blue). Therefore, there is plenty of green light available for reflection by the chlorophyll in leaves, making green a common color for terrestrial plants.\n\nIt's worth noting that not all plants are green, especially those living in environments with unique lighting conditions or those that have adapted to different ecological niches. For example, some algae and plants in deeper waters where red light is scarce may appear red due to the presence of other pigments like phycoerythrin, which absorbs green light instead of reflecting it.", "shortest_response": "Many plants are green because of a pigment called chlorophyll, which plays a crucial role in the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is how plants convert light energy into chemical energy to fuel their growth and survival.\n\nChlorophyll is primarily located in the chloroplasts of plant cells, especially in the leaves where sunlight is most abundant. This pigment absorbs light most efficiently in the blue and red parts of the electromagnetic spectrum but reflects green light, which is why our eyes perceive these plants as green.\n\nIt's worth noting that while green is the predominant color for many plants, there are variations and exceptions. For instance, some plants may appear red, purple, or even variegated due to other pigments like anthocyanins and carotenoids, which can mask the green color of chlorophyll or be present alongside it. The primary function of chlorophyll in capturing light for photosynthesis remains the reason why green is such a common color in the plant kingdom.", "input_size": 35, "output_sizes": [242, 232, 198, 238, 249, 229, 205, 246, 269, 364], "output_mean": 247.2, "output_std": 43.59, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 229.75, "p50": 240.0, "p75": 248.25, "p99": 355.45}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 24.48355}, {"sample_id": "c2dd277532199a33", "prompt_id": "f73169ecd047b2b2", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "How reliable is public transportation?", "longest_response": "The reliability of public transportation can vary significantly depending on several factors, including the specific city or region, the type of service (e.g., bus, subway, train), and the time of day.

However, delays can occur due to traffic congestion, mechanical issues, or unexpected events.\n\n2. **Coverage and Network**: The extent and quality of the network can affect reliability. Cities with extensive and well-integrated networks tend to offer more reliable services as there are often alternative routes and connections available if one part of the system is disrupted.\n\n3. **Maintenance and Upkeep**: Regular maintenance of vehicles and infrastructure is crucial for reliability.

By averaging these two values, we can get a better approximation.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of why this method works:\n\n1. **Initial Guess**: Start with an initial guess \\(x_0\\) for the square root of \\(S\\).\n\n2. **Iterative Step**: For each iteration, calculate a new estimate using the formula:\n   \\[\n   x_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( x_n + \\frac{S}{x_n} \\right)\n   \\]\n   where \\(x_n\\) is the current estimate and \\(x_{n+1}\\) is the next estimate.\n\n3. **Convergence**: This process converges to the square root of \\(S\\).

This can be any positive number, but choosing a value closer to the actual square root will reduce the number of iterations needed.\n\n2. **Iterate using the formula**: For each iteration \\(k\\), compute the next approximation \\(x_{k+1}\\) from the current approximation \\(x_k\\) using the formula:\n   \\[\n   x_{k+1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( x_k + \\frac{n}{x_k} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Repeat until convergence**: Continue iterating until the difference between successive approximations is sufficiently small (i.e., \\(|x_{k+1} - x_k| < \\epsilon\\), where \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small threshold value).\n\n### Why It Works\n\nThe method works because it uses a combination of the arithmetic mean (average) and harmonic mean (reciprocal of the average of the reciprocals) to converge towards the geometric mean of the two numbers involved in the iteration process, which is the square root of \\(n\\).\n\n- **Arithmetic Mean**: \\(\\frac{x_k + \\frac{n}{x_k}}{2}\\)\n- **Geometric Mean**: \\(\\sqrt{x_k \\cdot \\frac{n}{x_k}} = \\sqrt{n}\\)\n\nEach iteration effectively averages the current estimate with a correction factor that helps pull the estimate towards the true square root. As the iterations progress, the estimate gets refined and converges to the square root of \\(n\\).\n\nThis method is efficient and converges quickly, making it a popular choice for computing square roots both manually and computationally.", "input_size": 42, "output_sizes": [675, 592, 794, 503, 778, 435, 669, 671, 679, 691], "output_mean": 648.7, "output_std": 105.95, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 611.25, "p50": 673.0, "p75": 688.0, "p99": 792.56}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 58.61882}, {"sample_id": "367f2dddde01da92", "prompt_id": "3c03855fd21f1cec", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What are 6 different reasons to go on vacation?", "longest_response": "Going on vacation can serve many purposes and bring a variety of benefits.

The goal of process mining is to turn event data into insights and actions.

Process mining provides novel insights that can be used to identify the executional path taken by operational processes and address their performance and compliance problems.\n\nProcess mining starts from event data. Input for process mining is an event log. An event log views a process from a particular angle. Each event in the log should contain (1) a unique identifier for a particular process instance (called case id), (2) an activity (description of the event that is occurring), and (3) a timestamp. There may be additional event attributes referring to resources, costs, etc., but these are optional. With some effort, such data can be extracted from any information system supporting operational processes. Process mining uses these event data to answer a variety of process-related questions.", "longest_response": "Process mining is a set of methods and techniques that bridge the gap between data science and process management. It allows analysts and managers to understand and optimize business processes by analyzing event logs\u2014records of activities performed within a process. These logs capture the actual behavior of processes as they occur in real-time, providing a detailed view of how tasks are executed, who performs them, when they happen, and more.\n\nThe primary objective of process mining is to extract meaningful insights from event data, which can then inform decisions aimed at improving process efficiency, compliance, and overall performance. By leveraging event logs, process mining can reveal patterns, bottlenecks, and deviations in process execution that might not be apparent through traditional monitoring or reporting methods.\n\nKey aspects of process mining include:\n\n1. **Event Log Analysis**: At its core, process mining relies on event logs. Each event in the log typically includes details like a unique identifier for the process instance (case ID), the activity being performed, and the time it occurred. Additional attributes, such as resource usage or costs, can also be included.\n\n2. **Discovery**: One of the main techniques in process mining is discovery. This involves creating a model of the process based solely on the event data without prior assumptions about how the process should work. This model can highlight variations in how tasks are carried out across different instances.\n\n3. **Conformance Checking**: Another important technique is conformance checking, which compares the actual process behavior captured in the event logs against an expected or ideal process model. This helps identify discrepancies and areas where the actual process deviates from the desired process flow.\n\n4. **Enhancement**: Based on the insights gained from discovery and conformance checking, process mining can facilitate process enhancement. This involves identifying inefficiencies, redundancies, and non-compliance issues that can then be addressed to improve process performance.\n\n5. **Integration with Information Systems**: To perform process mining, event data must be collected from various sources within an organization's IT infrastructure. This often requires integration with existing information systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and other operational databases.\n\nBy applying process mining techniques, organizations can gain deeper insights into their operational processes, leading to better decision-making, enhanced process efficiency, and improved compliance with regulatory standards.", "shortest_response": "Process mining is a set of techniques that bridges the gap between data science and process management.

These could include increasing brand awareness, generating leads, boosting sales, or improving customer engagement.\n\n2. **Track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Identify KPIs relevant to your objectives. Common KPIs include:\n   - **Return on Investment (ROI)**: Measures how much profit is generated relative to the cost of investment.\n   - **Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)**: The amount spent to acquire one customer.\n   - **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: The total revenue a business can reasonably expect from a single customer account throughout the business relationship.\n   - **Conversion Rate**: The percentage of visitors who take a desired action on your site.\n   - **Engagement Metrics**: Such as click-through rates (CTR), bounce rate, time on page, etc., depending on your channel.\n\n3. **Use Analytics Tools**: Leverage tools like Google Analytics, Facebook Insights, or platform-specific analytics to track these KPIs. Ensure data accuracy and consistency across different platforms.\n\n4. **Attribution Modeling**: Understand how different channels contribute to conversions. Attribution modeling helps in distributing credit to various touchpoints in the customer journey.\n\n5. **Regular Reporting**: Create regular reports (monthly, quarterly) that summarize the performance of each marketing activity against the set KPIs. This helps in identifying trends and making informed decisions.\n\n6. **A/B Testing**: Regularly test different versions of your marketing materials (e.g., ad copy, email subject lines) to see what performs better. This can provide insights into consumer behavior and preferences.\n\n7. **Feedback Loops**: Collect feedback from customers through surveys or direct communication. Understanding their experience and perception can offer qualitative insights that quantitative data might miss.\n\n8. **Adjust and Optimize**: Based on the analysis, adjust your marketing strategy. This might involve reallocating budget to more effective channels, refining target audience definitions, or modifying the creative elements of your campaigns.\n\n9. **Consider Long-Term Impact**: Sometimes, the impact of marketing activities is not immediate but accumulates over time.

As the largest optical telescope in space, it is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars, the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.\n\nThe U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led JWST's design and development and partnered with two main agencies: the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Maryland managed telescope development, while the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore on the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University currently operates JWST. The primary contractor for the project was Northrop Grumman. The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana, and arrived at the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point in January 2022. The first JWST image was released to the public via a press conference on 11 July 2022.\n\nJWST's primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated beryllium, which combined create a 6.5-meter-diameter (21 ft) mirror, compared with Hubble's 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). This gives JWST a light-collecting area of about 25 square meters, about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet and visible (0.1 to 0.8 \u03bcm), and near infrared (0.8\u20132.5 \u03bcm) spectra, JWST observes a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light (red) through mid-infrared (0.6\u201328.3 \u03bcm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below 50 K (\u2212223 \u00b0C; \u2212370 \u00b0F), such that the infrared light emitted by the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. It is deployed in a solar orbit near the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point, about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 mi) from Earth, where its five-layer sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\n\nInitial designs for the telescope, then named the Next Generation Space Telescope, began in 1996. Two concept studies were commissioned in 1999, for a potential launch in 2007 and a US$1 billion budget. The program was plagued with enormous cost overruns and delays; a major redesign in 2005 led to the current approach, with construction completed in 2016 at a total cost of US$10 billion. The high-stakes nature of the launch and the telescope's complexity were remarked upon by the media, scientists, and engineers.", "longest_response": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a sophisticated space observatory designed primarily for infrared astronomy. It is significantly larger than its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, featuring a primary mirror composed of 18 hexagonal segments made of gold-plated beryllium, giving it a diameter of 6.5 meters and a light-collecting area about six times larger than Hubble\u2019s. This allows JWST to observe older, more distant, and fainter objects in space than previously possible. Its unique capabilities enable astronomers to study the early universe, including the formation of the first stars and galaxies, and to analyze the atmospheres of exoplanets for signs of habitability.\n\nDeveloped under the leadership of NASA, with significant contributions from the European and Canadian space agencies, JWST was launched on December 25, 2021, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. The telescope reached its operational orbit at the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrange point in January 2022. To maintain its sensitivity to infrared light, JWST must operate at extremely low temperatures, below -223\u00b0C (-370\u00b0F), which is achieved through a large, five-layer sunshield that blocks heat from the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\n\nThe project faced numerous challenges, including significant cost overruns and delays, but it was successfully completed and launched after extensive redesigns and testing.

Water passes through ground coffee and a filter, resulting in a clean and straightforward taste.\n\n2. **French Press (Plunger Pot)**: Ground coffee is steeped in hot water for several minutes before being separated from the grounds by pressing down a plunger with a metal or nylon mesh filter. It produces a rich, full-bodied cup.\n\n3. **Pour Over (Manual Drip)**: This involves pouring hot water over coffee grounds placed in a filter, allowing the liquid to drip into a carafe below. It offers precise control over variables like water temperature and pour rate, leading to a very clean and flavorful cup.\n\n4. **Espresso Machine**: This method uses high pressure to force hot water through finely-ground coffee beans, creating a concentrated shot of coffee. Espresso can be enjoyed on its own or used as the base for other drinks like lattes and cappuccinos.\n\n5. **Aeropress**: A more recent invention, the Aeropress combines elements of both press and pour-over brewing methods. Coffee grounds are steeped in hot water, then forced through a paper filter using air pressure. The result is a smooth, low-acid cup.\n\n6. **Cold Brew**: Coffee grounds are steeped in cold water for an extended period, typically 12-24 hours, then strained. This method results in a smoother, less acidic coffee that is often served chilled.\n\n7. **Moka Pot (Stovetop Espresso)**: Similar to espresso, but made on a stovetop. Hot water is forced up through the coffee grounds by steam pressure, producing a strong, rich coffee similar to espresso but without the crema.\n\n8. **Siphon (Vacuum) Brewer**: This method uses two chambers where water is heated in the bottom chamber and drawn up into the top chamber containing the coffee grounds. Once the heat source is removed, the brewed coffee is drawn back down into the bottom chamber, leaving the grounds behind.\n\n9. **Turkish Coffee**: Finely ground coffee is mixed directly with water (and sometimes sugar) and boiled in a pot called a cezve. The mixture is then poured into small cups, including the grounds. It's a very strong and unfiltered method.\n\n10. **Vietnamese Drip Filter**: Often used with sweetened condensed milk, this method involves a tall glass drip filter that slowly drips hot water through finely ground coffee, creating a thick, syrupy, and aromatic brew.\n\nEach of these methods can significantly alter the taste and texture of your coffee, allowing you to find the perfect brewing technique to suit your preferences.", "shortest_response": "Certainly!

Revenue and expense should be kept separate from personal expenses.\nGoing Concern: assumes that the business will be in operation indefinitely. This validates the methods of asset capitalization, depreciation, and amortization. Only when liquidation is certain this assumption is not applicable. The business will continue to exist in the unforeseeable future.\nMonetary Unit principle: assumes a stable currency is going to be the unit of record. The FASB accepts the nominal value of the US Dollar as the monetary unit of record unadjusted for inflation.\nTime-period principle: implies that the economic activities of an enterprise can be divided into artificial time periods.\nPrinciples\nHistorical cost principle: requires companies to account and report assets and liabilities acquisition costs rather than fair market value. This principle provides information that is reliable (removing opportunity to provide subjective and potentially biased market values), but not very relevant. Thus there is a trend to use fair values. Most debts and securities are now reported at market values.\nRevenue recognition principle: holds that companies should record revenue when earned but not when received. The flow of cash does not have any bearing on the recognition of revenue. This is the essence of accrual basis accounting. Conversely, however, losses must be recognized when their occurrence becomes probable, whether or not it has actually occurred. This comports with the constraint of conservatism, yet brings it into conflict with the constraint of consistency, in that reflecting revenues/gains is inconsistent with the way in which losses are reflected.\nMatching principle: expenses have to be matched with revenues as long as it is reasonable to do so. Expenses are recognized not when the work is performed, or when a product is produced, but when the work or the product actually makes its contribution to revenue. Only if no connection with revenue can be established, cost may be charged as expenses to the current period (e.g., office salaries and other administrative expenses). This principle allows greater evaluation of actual profitability and performance (shows how much was spent to earn revenue). Depreciation and Cost of Goods Sold are good examples of application of this principle.\nFull disclosure principle: Amount and kinds of information disclosed should be decided based on trade-off analysis as a larger amount of information costs more to prepare and use. Information disclosed should be enough to make a judgment while keeping costs reasonable. Information is presented in the main body of financial statements, in the notes or as supplementary information\nConstraints\nObjectivity principle: The company financial statements provided by the accountants should be based on objective evidence.\nMateriality principle: The significance of an item should be considered when it is reported. An item is considered significant when it would affect the decision of a reasonable individual.\nConsistency principle: The company uses the same accounting principles and methods from period to period.\nConservatism principle: When choosing between two solutions, the one which has the less favorable outcome is the solution which should be chosen (see convention of conservatism)\nCost Constraint: The benefits of reporting financial information should justify and be greater than the costs imposed on supplying it.", "longest_response": "The four basic principles of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are foundational rules that guide the preparation and standardization of financial statements. Here\u2019s a summary of these principles:\n\n1. **Historical Cost Principle**: This principle mandates that companies record assets and liabilities at their original acquisition cost rather than their current market value. This approach ensures reliability in financial reporting by avoiding subjective valuation adjustments, although it can sometimes reduce the relevance of the reported figures.\n\n2. **Revenue Recognition Principle**: According to this principle, revenue should be recorded when it is earned, regardless of when the cash is actually received. This aligns with the accrual basis of accounting, where transactions are recorded in the period they occur, not necessarily when cash changes hands. Losses, conversely, must be recognized as soon as their occurrence becomes probable, adhering to the principle of conservatism.\n\n3. **Matching Principle**: This principle dictates that expenses should be matched with revenues in the same accounting period to accurately reflect the performance of the entity. Expenses are recorded in the period they contribute to generating revenue, rather than when the related goods or services are provided. This ensures a clear picture of profitability by aligning costs with the revenues they helped to generate.\n\n4. **Full Disclosure Principle**: This principle emphasizes the need for transparency in financial reporting. It states that all information necessary for stakeholders to make informed decisions should be disclosed. While there is a cost-benefit consideration, the principle stresses the importance of providing sufficient information within the main body of financial statements, footnotes, or supplementary materials to ensure full disclosure without overwhelming users with excessive data.\n\nThese principles collectively aim to enhance the accuracy, consistency, and comparability of financial reporting under GAAP.", "shortest_response": "The four basic principles of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are:\n\n1. **Historical Cost Principle**: This principle mandates that assets and liabilities be recorded at their original acquisition cost rather than their current market value.

This alternation reflects the dual focus on both legal theory and its application in the medical field.\n\nThe prize itself has a rich history, marked by changes in its physical form over the years. Early designs were based on a pattern created by Daniel Maclise, which was used consistently until 1919. After this period, a new cup design was introduced by Melvin Oliver in 1919, signaling a shift towards modernizing the prize's appearance while maintaining its traditional significance.\n\nGeorge Swiney, after whom the prize is named, was a physician with an intriguing personal history. Born in 1793, he pursued his medical education at Edinburgh University, graduating in 1816. Later in life, he chose to retire from active medical practice and moved to London, where he lived a somewhat reclusive life. His legacy extends beyond his professional achievements, as evidenced by his detailed planning of his will, which ultimately led to the establishment of the Swiney Prize.

Here's how they differ:\n\n1. **Purpose**:\n   - **Driver**: The driver is designed for hitting long-distance shots, typically from the tee box at the start of each hole. It is the longest club in terms of shaft length and has the largest head among all golf clubs.\n   - **Putter**: A putter is specifically designed for making short, precise strokes on or near the green to get the ball into the hole. It is used almost exclusively on the putting surface.\n\n2. **Club Head Design**:\n   - **Driver**: Drivers have large heads, often made of metal (like titanium), which helps maximize distance when hitting the ball off the tee. They also have a low center of gravity to help lift the ball into the air.\n   - **Putter**: Putters come in various shapes and sizes, but their design focuses on stability and accuracy rather than distance. Common designs include blade putters, mallet putters, and heel-toe weighted putters, each offering different benefits in terms of feel and performance.\n\n3. **Shaft Length and Flexibility**:\n   - **Driver**: The driver has the longest shaft of any golf club, which allows for a longer swing arc and greater potential for speed and distance. The shaft is generally more flexible to accommodate the high-speed swings needed to hit long drives.\n   - **Putter**: Putters have much shorter shafts compared to drivers, allowing for better control over the direction and speed of the ball on the green. The shaft is usually less flexible as it needs to transmit the player's hand movements directly to the ball without losing power or direction.\n\n4. **Angle of Attack**:\n   - **Driver**: When using a driver, players aim to hit the ball with an upward angle of attack to achieve maximum height and distance.\n   - **Putter**: With a putter, the goal is to strike the ball with a nearly flat or slightly downward angle to ensure a smooth roll along the ground towards the hole.\n\nEach club serves a specific role in a golfer\u2019s game, and mastering their use can significantly impact one's overall performance on the course.", "shortest_response": "In golf, both the putter and the driver are types of clubs used by players, but they serve very different purposes on the course.\n\n1. **Driver**: This is one of the longest clubs in a golfer's bag, designed to hit the ball the farthest distance. It has a large, slightly curved clubhead and a long shaft. Drivers are typically used off the tee at the start of each hole to cover as much ground as possible. They require a high degree of skill to control, as the longer shaft and larger head make it challenging to consistently strike the ball with precision and power.\n\n2. **Putter**: On the other hand, the putter is used primarily on the green for putting the ball into the hole.

Unlike a standard view which is virtual and computes its data dynamically every time it's queried, a materialized view precomputes and stores the results of the query at a specific point in time. This can provide several advantages:\n\n1. **Performance**: Since the results are precomputed and stored, querying a materialized view can be faster than running the original query on the underlying tables, especially if the original query involves complex operations like joins, aggregations, or computations across large datasets.\n\n2. **Simplified Queries**: Materialized views can simplify the queries run against them because they already contain the aggregated or computed data, making it easier for end-users or applications to retrieve the information they need without having to write complex queries.\n\n3. **Data Consistency**: They can ensure consistency of summarized data across different parts of an application or system, as the same precomputed values are used each time the view is accessed.\n\nHowever, there are also considerations to keep in mind when using materialized views:\n\n- **Staleness**: The data in a materialized view can become stale over time, depending on how often it is refreshed or updated. This means that the data might not always reflect the current state of the underlying tables unless the materialized view is refreshed regularly.\n\n- **Storage Space**: Since the results are stored physically, materialized views require additional storage space. This can be significant if the views are based on large datasets or if many materialized views are maintained.\n\n- **Maintenance Overhead**: Keeping the materialized view up-to-date can involve extra processing overhead, particularly if the underlying data changes frequently. Strategies for refreshing the view (such as on-demand, periodic refresh, or automatic refresh) need to be carefully considered to balance between freshness of data and performance impact.\n\nIn summary, materialized views are powerful tools for improving query performance and simplifying data access, but they come with trade-offs related to data staleness, storage requirements, and maintenance needs.", "shortest_response": "A materialized view in computing, specifically within the context of databases, is a database object that stores the results of a query physically on disk.

This technique is commonly used in sports medicine and physical therapy for its ability to enhance recovery and manage certain conditions related to injury and exercise.\n\nThe primary uses of contrast therapy include:\n\n1. **Reducing Swelling**: After an injury, applying contrast therapy can help reduce swelling by promoting better circulation and lymphatic drainage. The cold component constricts blood vessels, which helps decrease blood flow to the area and thus reduces swelling. The subsequent warm application then dilates these vessels, enhancing blood flow and aiding in the removal of waste products from the tissues.\n\n2. **Aiding Recovery from Exercise**: Post-exercise, contrast therapy can accelerate muscle recovery by helping to clear metabolic waste products like lactic acid from the muscles. This process can reduce soreness and fatigue, allowing athletes to return to training more quickly.\n\n3. **Improving Circulation**: Alternating between hot and cold temperatures can stimulate blood flow and improve overall circulation, which is beneficial for healing and recovery processes.\n\n4. **Pain Relief**: Contrast therapy can provide relief from pain associated with overuse or minor injuries by altering nerve impulses and increasing endorphin production, which act as natural painkillers.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that contrast therapy is contraindicated in the acute phase of an injury (typically the first 72 hours post-injury). During this period, the body undergoes significant inflammatory responses, and the use of contrast therapy could potentially exacerbate inflammation and delay healing.

She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country artist to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.\nSwift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\nExiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021\u2014Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her 2022 album Midnights and single \"Anti-Hero\" broke all-time streaming records. Swift has directed music videos and films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and played supporting roles in others.\nHaving sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians in history. She is the most streamed woman on Spotify and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards; and 92 Guinness World Records. Swift has been featured in rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100.

Isn't it possible that the listener would associate \"pencil\" with \"wood\"? Maybe the listener would associate the word \"pencil\" with \"round\" instead (as pencils are, usually, in fact, round!). Wittgenstein writes regarding several possible \"interpretations\" which may arise after such a lesson. The student may interpret your pointing at a pencil and saying \"pencil\" to mean the following: (1) This is a pencil; (2) This is round; (3) This is wood; (4) This is one; (5) This is hard, etc., etc.", "longest_response": "Ludwig Wittgenstein, a prominent philosopher of the 20th century, addresses the issue of ostensive teaching (or ostensive definition) in his work, particularly in the \"Philosophical Investigations.\" When discussing the problem of learning a language through ostensive means, Wittgenstein highlights the ambiguity and potential misinterpretation that can arise from such a method.\n\nOstensive teaching involves pointing to an object and naming it, expecting the learner to understand the connection between the word and the object. However, as you've noted, this process is fraught with problems. When someone points to a pencil and says \"pencil,\" there's no inherent reason why the learner must associate the word \"pencil\" with the whole object rather than a specific aspect of it, like its shape or material. The learner could just as easily conclude that the term refers to the wood, the roundness, or any other feature of the object.\n\nWittgenstein emphasizes that without a shared background or context, the act of pointing and naming can lead to multiple interpretations. The learner might interpret the word \"pencil\" to mean \"wood,\" \"round,\" \"one,\" \"hard,\" or indeed \"pencil,\" but there's no guarantee which interpretation will be chosen. This multiplicity of possible meanings underscores the difficulty in establishing a clear and unambiguous link between a word and its referent solely through ostension.\n\nThus, Wittgenstein argues that language acquisition cannot rely solely on ostensive definitions because they fail to capture the complex rules and conventions that govern language use. He suggests that language is more than a collection of isolated word-object associations; it is deeply embedded within a social and cultural context, involving shared practices and understanding. This insight contributes to his broader philosophy about the nature of meaning and communication, highlighting the importance of the linguistic community and the context in which language operates.", "shortest_response": "Ludwig Wittgenstein identifies a significant issue with ostensive teaching, or \"ostensive defining,\" which involves the use of gestures or pointing to teach the meaning of words. In his work, particularly in \"Philosophical Investigations,\" Wittgenstein argues that when we point to an object and say its name, there's no inherent way for the learner to understand exactly what aspect of the object we're naming. \n\nFor instance, if you point to a pencil and say \"pencil,\" the learner could interpret this in multiple ways. They might think you're referring to the whole object, or just a part of it, like the wooden body or the graphite core. Alternatively, they might interpret \"pencil\" as describing a shape (round), material (wood), or even a property (hard). \n\nWittgenstein suggests that the success of ostensive teaching relies on a shared form of life or background knowledge between the teacher and the learner. Without a common context or set of conventions, the act of pointing and naming can lead to various interpretations, none of which can be definitively determined as correct based solely on the act of pointing.

I've got some exciting news that I just had to share with you \u2013 I've started my first job and earned my very first wage. It's a momentous occasion for me, and I feel like it marks the beginning of a new chapter in my life.\n\nStarting this job has been a whirlwind of emotions. There was nervousness as I prepared for my first day, excitement as I stepped into the office, and now, a sense of accomplishment as I look at my paycheck. It\u2019s not just about the money; it\u2019s about the independence and responsibility that comes with earning it. I can't help but feel a bit proud of myself for making it through the initial days and adapting to the workplace environment.\n\nThe most striking feeling is the sense of achievement. After all those years of studying and preparing, it feels incredible to see my efforts translate into tangible results. It\u2019s a reminder that hard work does pay off, and it motivates me to keep pushing forward.\n\nOf course, there have been challenges too. The learning curve has been steep, and sometimes I\u2019ve felt overwhelmed. But each challenge has taught me something valuable, whether it\u2019s a new skill or a better way to manage my time. These experiences are shaping me into someone more capable and resilient.\n\nI\u2019m also starting to appreciate the value of money in a whole new light. It\u2019s not just about spending it on what I want; it\u2019s about making thoughtful decisions that will benefit me in the long run. I\u2019m already planning how to use my earnings wisely, whether it\u2019s saving up for something special or investing in my personal growth.\n\nIt\u2019s funny how quickly things change. Just a few weeks ago, I was still getting used to the idea of being employed. Now, here I am, reflecting on my first paycheck and all the feelings it brings. It\u2019s a mix of relief, excitement, and a hint of trepidation about what lies ahead.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this. Have you had similar experiences when you started your first job? How did you feel about earning your first wage? I\u2019m looking forward to catching up soon and sharing more details about my new adventures.\n\nTake care and talk to you soon!\n\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]", "shortest_response": "Dear Alex,\n\nI hope this letter finds you well and in high spirits!

Today, however, feels like the perfect moment to share something really exciting with you.\n\nLast week, I received my very first paycheck from the part-time job I started a couple of months ago. It's hard to describe the mix of emotions I felt when I saw those numbers in my bank account. There was a rush of excitement, a bit of disbelief, and a deep sense of accomplishment. You know how we've always talked about being independent and making our own way in the world? Well, it feels like I\u2019ve taken a big step towards that dream.\n\nThe job itself isn't glamorous \u2013 I work at a local bookstore during the evenings. But every day, I learn so much more than just how to stack books or help customers find what they're looking for. I'm learning about responsibility, time management, and the value of hard work. And seeing that first paycheck is a tangible reminder of all those lessons.\n\nIt also made me think about us, Alex. Remember how we used to dream about saving up enough money to travel together once we could afford it? This paycheck might not be enough to buy tickets to Europe, but it's a start. A small step towards bigger goals.\n\nI can't wait to tell you more about my experiences at work and maybe even plan a weekend getaway with the extra cash. How does that sound?\n\nTake care, and let\u2019s catch up soon!\n\nWarmly,\n[Your Name]", "input_size": 44, "output_sizes": [419, 469, 344, 445, 333, 358, 349, 376, 412, 382], "output_mean": 388.7, "output_std": 43.48, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 351.25, "p50": 379.0, "p75": 417.25, "p99": 466.84}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "creative_writing", "gen_time": 32.39575}, {"sample_id": "e350fc49726bddb8", "prompt_id": "28915c50541a3074", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What are the words of House Allyrion?", "longest_response": "House Allyrion is not one of the major houses prominently featured in George R.R.
