Here are some key areas that could drive sustained growth:\n\n### 1. **Expansion into New Markets and Segments**\n   - **Geographic Expansion**: While Uber has already expanded globally, there is still significant room for growth in untapped markets, especially in regions with high population density and growing middle classes.\n   - **Vertical Expansions**: Expanding into new verticals such as food delivery (Uber Eats), logistics, and last-mile delivery services can diversify revenue streams and create synergies between different segments of the business.\n\n### 2. **Focus on Mobility as a Service (MaaS)**\n   - **Integrated Mobility Solutions**: Uber should continue to develop its MaaS platform, which integrates various modes of transportation (e.g., ride-sharing, bike-sharing, scooter rentals, public transit) into a single app. This approach can attract more frequent users and reduce reliance on any one mode of transport.\n   - **Subscription Models**: Offering subscription-based plans for frequent users can help lock in customer loyalty and provide a predictable revenue stream.\n\n### 3. **Investment in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Ride-Hailing Platforms**\n   - **Autonomous Driving Technology**: Despite regulatory challenges and technical hurdles, continued investment in AV technology could transform Uber\u2019s core ride-hailing business by reducing labor costs and improving safety. This could also open up new opportunities for partnerships with automakers and tech companies.\n   - **Robotaxis**: Once autonomous vehicles become commercially viable, Uber\u2019s robotaxi service could become a cornerstone of its business model, offering a lower-cost alternative to traditional ride-hailing.\n\n### 4. **Enhanced Data and AI Capabilities**\n   - **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Uber has access to vast amounts of data from its rides, which can be leveraged to improve route optimization, pricing algorithms, and user experience. Leveraging advanced AI and machine learning can further enhance these capabilities, leading to more efficient operations and better customer satisfaction.\n   - **Predictive Analytics**: Predictive analytics can help Uber anticipate demand spikes, optimize vehicle routing, and improve driver retention by providing incentives based on performance.\n\n### 5. **Sustainability and Environmental Initiatives**\n   - **Green Transportation Options**: As consumer awareness of environmental issues grows, Uber needs to focus on promoting eco-friendly options like electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid cars. Partnering with EV manufacturers and charging infrastructure providers can help accelerate this transition.\n   - **Carbon Neutrality Goals**: Setting ambitious carbon neutrality goals and transparently communicating progress can help Uber appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and investors.\n\n### 6. **Driver and Employee Retention and Satisfaction**\n   - **Improved Driver Experience**: Drivers are a critical part of Uber\u2019s ecosystem, and improving their experience through better pay, benefits, and flexibility can lead to higher retention rates and better service quality.\n   - **Employee Well-being**: For employees at Uber Technologies Inc. (the parent company), investing in employee well-being programs, career development opportunities, and a positive work culture can foster long-term loyalty and innovation.\n\n### 7. **Regulatory Compliance and Policy Engagement**\n   - **Navigating Regulatory Challenges**: Uber must continue to engage with regulators and policymakers to navigate evolving regulations around ride-hailing, autonomous vehicles, and other services. Building strong relationships with governments can help mitigate risks and create favorable operating environments.\n   - **Policy Advocacy**: Advocating for policies that promote innovation and fair competition can position Uber as a leader in the industry.\n\n### 8. **Customer Experience and Brand Loyalty**\n   - **Personalization**: Enhancing the user experience through personalization can increase customer engagement and loyalty. Features like tailored recommendations, personalized promotions, and seamless integration with other services (e.g., payment methods, loyalty programs) can make Uber more attractive to users.\n   - **Brand Building**: Strengthening the brand by emphasizing trust, reliability, and value can help Uber maintain a competitive edge in a crowded market.\n\n### 9. **Partnerships and Strategic Alliances**\n   - **Strategic Partnerships**: Collaborations with automakers, tech companies, and other industry players can help Uber expand its offerings and stay ahead of competitors. For example, partnerships with EV manufacturers can accelerate the adoption of green transportation options.\n   - **Platform Ecosystem**: Building a robust ecosystem of partners, including logistics companies, fleet operators, and other mobility providers, can help Uber offer a more comprehensive suite of services and attract a wider range of customers.\n\n### 10. **Financial Discipline and Cost Management**\n   - **Cost Efficiency**: Uber has faced significant financial challenges due to heavy investments in expansion, technology development, and regulatory compliance. Ensuring cost efficiency and maintaining financial discipline will be crucial for long-term sustainability.\n   - **Revenue Growth**: Growing revenue through new products, services, and geographic expansions will help offset operational costs and improve profitability.\n\nIn summary, Uber\u2019s long-term growth will depend on its ability to innovate, expand into new markets and segments, and build a sustainable, customer-centric business model. By focusing on mobility as a service, sustainability, and leveraging data and AI, Uber can position itself as a leader in the future of transportation.", "shortest_response": "Uber's long-term growth will likely depend on several strategic initiatives and business strategies that address both internal and external challenges. Here are some key areas:\n\n1. **Expansion into New Markets and Geographies**: One of the most important strategies for Uber\u2019s growth is expanding into new markets, particularly in emerging economies where ride-hailing services are not yet widespread. This includes countries with growing middle classes and increasing urbanization.\n\n2. **Diversification of Services**: Diversifying beyond ride-hailing to include other transportation options like electric scooters (Uber Scooters), bicycles (Uber Bike), and eventually delivery services (Uber Eats). These initiatives can help reduce dependency on ride-hailing alone and create new revenue streams.\n\n3. **Focusing on Sustainability**: As concerns about climate change grow, there is a need for companies to focus on sustainability. Uber has already made commitments to reducing emissions and promoting electric vehicles. Expanding this focus could include partnerships with governments and other organizations to promote cleaner transportation solutions.\n\n4. **Investment in Technology**: Continuous investment in technology is crucial for Uber to stay competitive. This includes advancements in autonomous driving technology, which could revolutionize the way people move around cities.

While it may not be universally regarded as the \"best\" film of all time by everyone, it is frequently ranked at the top of various \"greatest films\" lists. Here are several reasons why *Citizen Kane* is held in such high regard:\n\n### 1. **Innovative Storytelling:**\n   - **Non-linear Narrative:** The film's use of a non-linear narrative structure, where the story is told through flashbacks, is groundbreaking. This technique allowed Orson Welles to explore multiple perspectives on Charles Foster Kane's life without relying solely on a straightforward chronological approach.\n   - **The Newspaper Clippings Technique:** The opening scene, which uses newspaper clippings to tell Kane's story, is a masterful way to introduce the protagonist and set up the film's themes of legacy, memory, and the passage of time.\n\n### 2. **Technical Achievements:**\n   - **Directional Innovation:** Orson Welles directed *Citizen Kane* at just 25 years old, making him one of the youngest directors to helm such a critically acclaimed film. His direction was bold, especially considering the limitations of film technology at the time.\n   - **Camera Movement:** The film features extensive camera movement, including tracking shots and crane shots, which were relatively rare in Hollywood during the 1940s. These techniques helped create a sense of fluidity and dynamism in the storytelling.\n   - **Sound Design:** The film's sound design, particularly the famous \"Rosebud\" revelation, is iconic. The use of voice-over narration and sound effects contributed to the film's immersive experience.\n\n### 3. **Themes and Depth:**\n   - **Ambition and Isolation:** The film explores the tragic story of a man who, despite his immense wealth and power, remains isolated and unfulfilled. Charles Foster Kane's pursuit of power and knowledge ultimately leads to his downfall, highlighting themes of ambition, loneliness, and the human condition.\n   - **Memory and Legacy:** Kane's obsession with leaving behind a legacy (symbolized by his final word, \"Rosebud\") is a universal theme that resonates with audiences. The film questions what it means to leave a lasting mark on the world and how our legacies are shaped by others' interpretations of our lives.\n\n### 4. **Iconic Characters and Performances:**\n   - **Raymond Massey as Kane:** Massey's portrayal of the complex, enigmatic Kane is widely praised. His performance captures both the charisma and the vulnerability of the character.\n   - **Joseph Cotten as Thompson:** Orson Welles also played the role of the reporter Thompson, who investigates Kane's life. Cotten's performance adds depth to the story, as Thompson's relentless pursuit of the truth mirrors Kane's own search for meaning.\n   - **Supporting Cast:** The supporting cast, including Dorothy Comingore, Agnes Moorehead, and William Alland, delivers strong performances that contribute to the film's overall quality.\n\n### 5. **Cultural Impact:**\n   - *Citizen Kane* is not just a film; it is a cultural touchstone. It influenced generations of filmmakers and continues to inspire new works. Its influence can be seen in the way directors handle storytelling, cinematography, and character development.\n   - The film's exploration of media and journalism also resonates in an era where news and information are more accessible than ever before.\n\n### 6. **Critical Acclaim:**\n   - Upon its release in 1941, *Citizen Kane* received critical acclaim for its technical innovations, storytelling, and performances. It won Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay (Herman J. Mankiewicz) and Best Original Story (Orson Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz), though it was nominated for Best Picture but lost to *How Green Was My Valley*.\n\n### Why It Might Not Be Considered the \"Best\" Film:\nWhile *Citizen Kane* is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, it may not be considered the \"best\" by everyone for several reasons:\n- **Subjectivity:** Personal taste plays a significant role in determining what constitutes the \"best\" film. Some people prefer films that offer a more straightforward narrative or emotional impact.\n- **Comparisons:** Films like *The Godfather*, *Casablanca*, *Pulp Fiction*, and *Vertigo* are often cited as contenders for the title of \"best film,\" each offering unique qualities that resonate with different audiences.\n- **Historical Context:** Some films from earlier periods of cinema, like *The Passion of Joan of Arc* or *Intolerance*, are also considered masterpieces but may not have the same cultural impact as *Citizen Kane*.\n\nIn summary, *Citizen Kane* is celebrated for its innovative storytelling, technical achievements, and profound exploration of human nature. Its influence on cinema and its place in the pantheon of great films make it a standout work, but whether it is \"the best\" film is a matter of personal and collective interpretation.", "shortest_response": "\"Citizen Kane\" is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, and it is often cited as the best film of all time for several compelling reasons:\n\n### 1. **Innovative Filmmaking Techniques**:\n   - **Orson Welles' Vision**: Directed by Orson Welles at the age of 25, \"Citizen Kane\" was revolutionary in its approach to filmmaking.

Charles Foster Kane\u2019s rise to power and subsequent downfall are emblematic of these themes, making the film universally relatable.\n   - **Psychological Depth**: The film offers a nuanced portrayal of Kane, whose inner turmoil and regrets are explored through flashbacks. His obsession with the word \"Rosebud,\" which becomes a central mystery, adds layers of psychological complexity to his character.\n\n### 3. **Historical and Cultural Significance**:\n   - **A Milestone in Hollywood**: Released in 1941, \"Citizen Kane\" challenged the conventions of the studio system and the rigid hierarchies of the film industry. Its success helped pave the way for independent filmmakers and auteurs.\n   - **Critical Acclaim**: The film received critical acclaim upon release, though it underperformed at the box office due to its controversial portrayal of William Randolph Hearst, a powerful media mogul. Despite this, its legacy has endured, and it has been critically reevaluated over the decades.\n\n### 4. **Technological Breakthroughs**:\n   - **Sound Design**: The film's innovative use of sound, including the famous scene where Kane screams \"\u73ab\u7470", "input_size": 28, "output_sizes": [473, 699, 760, 633, 912, 643, 786, 746, 1074, 693], "output_mean": 741.9, "output_std": 154.82, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 655.5, "p50": 722.5, "p75": 779.5, "p99": 1059.42}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 24.41123}, {"sample_id": "9c77690c2dd14908", "prompt_id": "ffc2991b2034be42", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What is a wallet used for?", "longest_response": "A wallet serves multiple purposes, primarily related to carrying and managing money and other important items.

Here are some steps to help guide you in making this choice:\n\n### 1. **Evaluate Your Lifestyle**\n   - **Activity Level**: Do you lead an active lifestyle, or do you prefer a more relaxed pace? Dogs with high energy levels (like border collies or Australian shepherds) require plenty of exercise, while others may be content with shorter walks.\n   - **Work Schedule**: If you work long hours, a low-maintenance breed might be better suited for you. Some breeds, like basenjis or dachshunds, are independent and can thrive even when left alone for extended periods.\n   - **Space**: Consider the size of your home and yard. Smaller spaces may not accommodate large breeds, and certain breeds may need more room to run around.\n\n### 2. **Family Dynamics**\n   - **Children**: If you have children, you\u2019ll want a breed that is patient, gentle, and good with kids. Breeds like golden retrievers, labradors, or bichon frises tend to be great with families.\n   - **Other Pets**: If you already have pets, consider compatibility. Some dogs, like chihuahuas or toy poodles, are naturally wary of other animals, while others, like golden retrievers, are generally friendly towards cats and other dogs.\n   - **Allergies**: Some breeds, like poodles or hypoallergenic breeds, produce less dander and may be better for people with allergies.\n\n### 3. **Behavioral Traits**\n   - **Energy Level**: Are you looking for a calm, laid-back dog, or one that is playful and energetic? Dogs like beagles and terriers are known for their high energy, while breeds like bulldogs and pugs are more relaxed.\n   - **Trainability**: Some breeds, like border collies and poodles, are highly intelligent and trainable, while others, like chow chows or shih tzus, may be more stubborn.\n   - **Guarding Instincts**: If you\u2019re interested in a guard dog, breeds like German shepherds, rottweilers, or pit bulls are often chosen for their protective nature. However, it\u2019s important to note that any dog can be trained to protect its family, so breed isn\u2019t the only factor.\n\n### 4. **Health Considerations**\n   - **Life Expectancy**: Some breeds have shorter lifespans (e.g., chihuahuas, toy poodles), while others live longer (e.g., labradors, golden retrievers).\n   - **Common Health Issues**: Certain breeds are prone to specific health issues. For example, flat-faced breeds (like pugs and bulldogs) can struggle with breathing, while certain breeds like labradors and golden retrievers are prone to hip dysplasia. Research the breed\u2019s common health problems to ensure you\u2019re prepared for potential vet visits.\n\n### 5. **Maintenance and Grooming**\n   - **Shedding**: Some breeds shed heavily, while others, like poodles and schnauzers, are almost non-shedders. If you have allergies or live in a small space, a low-shedder may be preferable.\n   - **Grooming Needs**: Some breeds, like poodles or shih tzu, require regular grooming, while others, like beagles, have minimal grooming needs.\n   - **Exercise Requirements**: Dogs with high energy levels, such as border collies or greyhounds, will need more exercise and mental stimulation than couch potatoes like bulldogs or pugs.\n\n### 6. **Cost Considerations**\n   - **Initial Cost**: Adoption fees, spaying/neutering, vaccinations, and microchipping can all add up. Rescue dogs are often less expensive than purchasing from a breeder.\n   - **Long-Term Costs**: Consider ongoing costs like food, veterinary care, and training. Some breeds have higher medical bills due to genetic conditions, while others may require specialized diets.\n\n### 7. **Rescue vs. Purchase**\n   - **Adoption**: Adopting a dog from a shelter or rescue organization is often a more humane option and can give you a second chance to save a life. Many shelters offer mixed-breed dogs, which can be just as loving and loyal as purebreds.\n   - **Breeder**: Purchasing from a reputable breeder ensures you get a healthy, well-bred dog, but it can be more expensive and may come with certain expectations (e.g., health guarantees).\n\n### 8. **Research and Visit**\n   - **Visit Local Shelters**: Spend time with different breeds and see which ones seem to click with you. Many shelters allow you to take a dog home for a few days to see if it\u2019s a good fit.\n   - **Talk to Breeders**: If you choose to buy, visit reputable breeders and ask questions about the breed\u2019s temperament, health, and training needs.\n\n### 9. **Consider Your Goals**\n   - **Companion Dog**: A breed like a beagle or bichon frise may be perfect for someone who wants a loving companion.\n   - **Working Dog**: If you\u2019re interested in a working dog, breeds like border collies, German shepherds, or Labrador retrievers are excellent choices.\n   - **Hypoallergenic Dog**: If you or someone in your household has allergies, breeds like poodles, bichons, or Portuguese water dogs may be a better fit.\n\n### 10. **Final Thoughts**\n   Once you\u2019ve considered all these factors, trust your instincts. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019ve found the right dog for you. Remember that a dog is a lifelong commitment, so it\u2019s important to choose a breed that aligns with your lifestyle, values, and personality.\n\nBy carefully considering these factors, you\u2019ll be better equipped to make an informed decision about the type of dog that will bring joy and companionship into your life.", "shortest_response": "Deciding on the type of dog to purchase or adopt is a significant decision that can have a lasting impact on your lifestyle and relationship with your pet.

Small breeds may be better for apartments, while larger breeds need more space.\n   - **Activity Level**: Think about how active you are and how much time you can dedicate to exercise. Some dogs require daily walks or playtime, while others are content with short activities.\n   - **Work Schedule**: If you work long hours, you\u2019ll need a breed that is okay with being alone for extended periods or one that enjoys independent play.\n\n### 2. **Consider Your Family**\n   - **Children**: If you have kids, consider breeds that are patient and gentle with children. Also, think about whether the dog will get along with other pets you already have.\n   - **Seniors or Allergies**: Some breeds are hypoallergenic (e.g., poodles, bichons frises) and may be better for households with allergies or older adults who don\u2019t need an energetic companion.\n\n### 3. **Research Breed Characteristics**\n   - **Temperament**: Different breeds have different temperaments. For example, retrievers are known for their friendly and outgoing nature, while terriers are often more energetic and independent.\n   - **Health Issues**: Some breeds are prone to certain health conditions. Research the common health issues associated with each breed to ensure you\u2019re prepared for any potential challenges.\n   - **Grooming Needs**: Some breeds require frequent grooming, while others are low-maintenance. Consider how much time you\u2019re willing to spend on grooming.\n\n### 4. **Evaluate Training Requirements**\n   - **Trainability**: Some breeds are naturally easier to train than others. If you're new to dog ownership, you might want to choose a breed that is generally easy to train.\n   - **Obedience**: Certain breeds are known for their intelligence and obedience, which can make training smoother.\n\n### 5. **Think About Longevity**\n   - **Life Expectancy**: Some breeds live longer than others. Consider how long you want to have your dog as a companion and whether the breed fits into your timeline.\n\n### 6. **Budget**\n   - **Initial Cost**: Adoption fees, spaying/neutering, vaccinations, and microchipping are initial expenses. Consider the cost of food, toys, treats, and veterinary care over the dog\u2019s lifetime.\n   - **Ongoing Costs**: Factor in the cost of dog supplies, grooming, and potential medical expenses.\n\n### 7. **Visit a Shelter or Breeder**\n   - **Shelters**: Adopting from a shelter allows you to meet many different dogs and find one that suits your needs. Shelters often have mixed breeds or rescued dogs that may have unique traits.\n   - **Breeders**: If you\u2019re interested in a specific breed, visiting a reputable breeder can provide more insight into the breed\u2019s temperament and history. However, be cautious and do thorough research to avoid scams.\n\n### 8. **Ask for Recommendations**\n   - Talk to friends, family, or local dog owners who have experience with different breeds. They can offer valuable insights based on their personal experiences.\n\n### 9. **Trial Period**\n   - If possible, spend time with the dog before deciding.

The story begins on Trantor, the capital of the 12,000-year-old Galactic Empire, powerful but slowly decaying. Hari Seldon, a mathematician and psychologist, has developed psychohistory, a new field of science and psychology that treats all possibilities in large societies by mathematics, allowing for the probabilistic prediction of future events.\n\nBy means of psychohistory, Seldon has discovered the decline and eventual fall of the Empire, angering the aristocratic members of the Commission of Public Safety, the de facto rulers of the Empire. The Commission considers Seldon's views and statements treasonous, and he is arrested along with the young mathematician Gaal Dornick, who has arrived on Trantor to join Seldon's group. Seldon is tried by the Commission; he defends his beliefs, explaining his theories and predictions, including his belief that the Empire will collapse in 300 years and while a Second Empire will eventually rise it will only come after a 30,000-year dark age. He informs the Commission that an alternative to this future is attainable and explains to them that creating a compendium of all human knowledge, the Encyclopedia Galactica, may not prevent the inevitable fall of the Empire but would reduce the dark age to one millennium.\n\nThe skeptical Commission, not wanting to make Seldon a martyr, offers him exile to a remote world, Terminus, with others who could help him create the Encyclopedia. He accepts their offer, prepares for the departure of the \"Encyclopedists\" and receives an imperial decree officially acknowledging his actions. Seldon informs Dornick that, despite the Empire's belief it won by exiling Seldon, the outcome was exactly what he had intended and hoped for. Terminus would be the home of the first Foundation while a second would be established \"at Star's End.\" Seldon then reveals that he is dying, and implores Dornick to become a leader in the new Foundation.", "longest_response": "Hari Seldon\n\nGaal Dornick", "shortest_response": "Hari Seldon\n\nGaal Dornick", "input_size": 476, "output_sizes": [11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11], "output_mean": 11.0, "output_std": 0.0, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 11.0, "p50": 11.0, "p75": 11.0, "p99": 11.0}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "information_extraction", "gen_time": 0.4078}, {"sample_id": "c4d55afaf613e88a", "prompt_id": "0476e9652a3c58f9", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What was the The Treaty of Tordesillas?\nContext: In 1383, John I of Castile, husband of Beatrice of Portugal and son-in-law of Ferdinand I of Portugal, claimed the throne of Portugal. A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by John of Aviz (later King John I of Portugal) and commanded by General Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira defeated the Castilians in the Battle of Aljubarrota. With this battle, the House of Aviz became the ruling house of Portugal.\n\nThe new ruling dynasty would proceed to push Portugal to the limelight of European politics and culture, creating and sponsoring works of literature, like the Cr\u00f3nicas d'el Rei D. Jo\u00e3o I by Fern\u00e3o Lopes, the first riding and hunting manual Livro da ensinan\u00e7a de bem cavalgar toda sela and O Leal Conselheiro both by King Edward of Portugal and the Portuguese translations of Cicero's De Oficiis and Seneca's De Beneficiis by the well traveled Prince Peter of Coimbra, as well as his magnum opus Tratado da Vertuosa Benfeytoria. In an effort of solidification and centralization of royal power the monarchs of this dynasty also ordered the compilation, organization and publication of the first three compilations of laws in Portugal: the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es d'el Rei D. Duarte, which was never enforced; the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Afonsinas, whose application and enforcement was not uniform across the realm; and the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Manuelinas, which took advantage of the printing press to reach every corner of the kingdom. The Avis Dynasty also sponsored works of architecture like the Mosteiro da Batalha (literally, the Monastery of the Battle) and led to the creation of the manueline style of architecture in the 16th century.\n\nPortugal also spearheaded European exploration of the world and the Age of Discovery. Prince Henry the Navigator, son of King John I of Portugal, became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour. During this period, Portugal explored the Atlantic Ocean, discovering the Atlantic archipelagos the Azores, Madeira, and Cape Verde; explored the African coast; colonized selected areas of Africa; discovered an eastern route to India via the Cape of Good Hope; discovered Brazil, explored the Indian Ocean, established trading routes throughout most of southern Asia; and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to China and Japan.\n\nIn 1415, Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering Ceuta, the first prosperous Islamic trade centre in North Africa. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: Madeira and the Azores, which led to the first colonization movements.\n\nIn 1422, by decree of King John I, Portugal officially abandoned the previous dating system, the Era of Caesar, and adopted the Anno Domini system, therefore becoming the last catholic realm to do so.\n\n\nThroughout the 15th century, Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for several common types of tradable commodities at the time, ranging from gold to slaves, as they looked for a route to India and its spices, which were coveted in Europe.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas, intended to resolve the dispute that had been created following the return of Christopher Columbus, was made by Pope Alexander VI, the mediator between Portugal and Spain. It was signed on 7 June 1494, and divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two countries along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa).\n\n\nIn 1498, Vasco da Gama accomplished what Columbus set out to do and became the first European to reach India by sea, bringing economic prosperity to Portugal and its population of 1.7 million residents, and helping to start the Portuguese Renaissance. In 1500, the Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real reached what is now Canada and founded the town of Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, Newfoundland and Labrador, long before the French and English in the 17th century, and being just one of many Portuguese colonizations of the Americas.\n\nIn 1500, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral discovered Brazil and claimed it for Portugal. Ten years later, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Goa in India, Muscat and Ormuz in the Persian Strait, and Malacca, now a state in Malaysia. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic. Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe, landing in such places as Taiwan, Japan, the island of Timor, and in the Moluccas.\n\nAlthough for a long period it was believed the Dutch were the first Europeans to arrive in Australia, there is also some evidence that the Portuguese may have discovered Australia in 1521. From 1519 to 1522, Ferdinand Magellan (Fern\u00e3o de Magalh\u00e3es) organized a Spanish expedition to the East Indies which resulted in the first circumnavigation of the globe. Magellan never made it back to Europe as he was killed by natives in the Philippines in 1521.\n\nThe Treaty of Zaragoza, signed on 22 April 1529 between Portugal and Spain, specified the anti-meridian to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas.\n\nAll these factors made Portugal one of the world's major economic, military, and political powers from the 15th century until the late 16th century.", "longest_response": "The **Treaty of Tordesillas** was a pivotal agreement signed on **June 7, 1494**, between the Kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, mediated by Pope Alexander VI. This treaty aimed to resolve the conflict that emerged after Christopher Columbus's voyage to the Americas in 1492, which had raised questions about the ownership of newly discovered territories. The primary goal of the treaty was to divide the newly discovered lands outside Europe between Spain and Portugal along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, which lie off the coast of West Africa.\n\n### Key Points of the Treaty:\n1. **Division of New Worlds**: The treaty established a dividing line between Spanish and Portuguese claims in the Western Hemisphere. Everything to the west of this line would belong to Spain, while everything to the east would belong to Portugal.\n   \n2. **Mediation by the Pope**: The treaty was signed under the auspices of Pope Alexander VI, who acted as a mediator between the two rival powers. At the time, the papacy had significant influence over European affairs, especially regarding matters of religion and territory.\n\n3. **Cape Verde Islands**: The dividing line was set 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, which were already Portuguese possessions. This meant that any land west of this line would be claimed by Spain, and any land east of this line would be claimed by Portugal.\n\n4. **Impact on Exploration**: The treaty influenced European exploration strategies, particularly those of Spain and Portugal. It encouraged both nations to focus their efforts on different parts of the world, with Spain exploring the Americas and Portugal focusing on Africa, Asia, and parts of the Indian Ocean.\n\n### Historical Context:\n- **Pre-Treaty Conflicts**: Before the Treaty of Tordesillas, Spain and Portugal had been in a dispute over the newly discovered lands. Columbus, believing he had reached Asia, had landed in the Caribbean, but it was not until 1497 that John Cabot, acting on behalf of England, confirmed that the lands were not part of Asia. This further complicated the situation.\n  \n- **Portuguese Ambitions**: Portugal had been expanding its maritime empire since the late 15th century, with Prince Henry the Navigator leading the way. By the time of the Treaty of Tordesillas, Portugal had already established colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Atlantic, and was eager to expand its influence further.\n\n### Aftermath:\n- **Portuguese Expansion**: The treaty allowed Portugal to continue its exploration and colonization efforts in the eastern hemisphere, including Africa, Asia, and parts of the Indian Ocean. This led to significant Portuguese achievements, such as the establishment of trading posts and colonies in India, Africa, and Southeast Asia.\n  \n- **Spanish Focus**: Spain focused more on the exploration and colonization of the Americas, which eventually led to the Spanish conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires and the establishment of the Spanish Empire in the New World.\n\n- **Limitations**: Despite the treaty, both Spain and Portugal found ways to circumvent its terms, especially when it came to the vastness of the newly discovered lands. For example, Spain later claimed territories that were east of the dividing line, and Portugal expanded into regions that were technically within Spain's claimed territory.\n\n### Legacy:\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas marked a significant moment in the history of European colonialism and diplomacy. It formalized the division of the world between Spain and Portugal, setting the stage for centuries of imperial expansion and competition. While the treaty aimed to resolve conflicts, it also created new ones, as both nations continued to vie for control over newly discovered lands.\n\nIn summary, the Treaty of Tordesillas was a landmark agreement that shaped the early modern period of European exploration and colonization, influencing the geopolitical landscape of the world for centuries to come.", "shortest_response": "The **Treaty of Tordesillas** was a significant agreement signed on **June 7, 1494**, between Spain and Portugal, mediated by Pope Alexander VI. This treaty was intended to resolve the dispute that emerged after Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, which had been claimed by Spain under the sponsorship of Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand II. The treaty aimed to divide the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two nations, effectively creating a line of demarcation.\n\n### Key Points of the Treaty:\n\n1. **Division of New Lands**: The treaty established a meridian line 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, which were already known to Portuguese explorers. West of this line, lands belonged to Portugal, and east of the line, lands belonged to Spain. This division gave Portugal control over much of the Atlantic coastline and the western part of the Americas, while Spain received the eastern portion of the Americas and parts of the Pacific.\n\n2. **Mediation by the Pope**: Pope Alexander VI, who was Spanish, played a crucial role in brokering the treaty. His decision was influenced by the geopolitical interests of both Spain and Portugal, as well as the desire to maintain peace between the two Christian kingdoms.\n\n3. **Impact on Exploration**: The treaty greatly influenced European exploration and colonization efforts. It gave Portugal a monopoly on exploration and colonization in the western hemisphere, which included Brazil and parts of North and South America. Spain, on the other hand, focused more on exploring and colonizing the eastern parts of the Americas, including Central and South America, the Caribbean, and parts of the Pacific.\n\n4. **Challenges to the Treaty**: Over time, the Treaty of Tordesillas faced challenges, particularly with the discovery of new lands and the expansion of European powers. For instance, the Dutch, English, and French eventually established their own colonies and trading posts in various parts of the world, challenging the original division. Additionally, the Treaty of Zaragoza in 1529 further adjusted the line of demarcation, giving Spain more territory in the Pacific.\n\n### Historical Significance:\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas was a pivotal moment in the history of European colonialism and exploration. It formalized the division of the world between Spain and Portugal, setting the stage for the Age of Discovery and the subsequent colonization of the Americas. While it gave Portugal a significant advantage in terms of land acquisition and trade, it also set the precedent for future colonial rivalries among European powers.\n\nOverall, the Treaty of Tordesillas played a crucial role in shaping the geopolitical landscape of the 15th and 16th centuries, influencing the course of global exploration, trade, and colonization.", "input_size": 1186, "output_sizes": [650, 627, 668, 556, 576, 702, 565, 673, 786, 645], "output_mean": 644.8, "output_std": 66.24, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 588.75, "p50": 647.5, "p75": 671.75, "p99": 778.44}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "closed_qa", "gen_time": 25.22653}, {"sample_id": "26bf84a735599c49", "prompt_id": "d0e143c5ef3f14e7", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Given this paragraph about Freddie Mercury, where was his last performance with Queen.\nContext: Throughout his career, Mercury performed an estimated 700 concerts in countries around the world with Queen.

What process should I use?", "longest_response": "Developing Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) is a structured process that helps align your team's efforts with the organization's goals. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you create effective OKRs:\n\n### 1. **Understand the Context**\n   - **Align with Organizational Goals**: Ensure that your team's OKRs are aligned with the broader company objectives. Understand what the company is trying to achieve in the short and long term.\n   - **Clarify Team Roles and Responsibilities**: Define what each team member or group is responsible for, so you can tailor OKRs accordingly.\n\n### 2. **Set Clear Objectives**\n   - **Objectives are Long-Term Goals**: Objectives should be ambitious yet achievable. They should answer the question, \"What do we want to accomplish?\" They should be specific, measurable, and time-bound.\n   - **Be Ambitious but Realistic**: Objectives should push your team out of their comfort zone but remain achievable. Avoid setting too many objectives that are overly ambitious or too few that don\u2019t challenge the team.\n   - **Focus on Outcomes, Not Activities**: Objectives should focus on the outcomes you want to achieve rather than the activities you plan to perform. For example, instead of saying \u201cincrease website traffic,\u201d an objective could be \u201cincrease customer acquisition by 20%.\u201d\n\n### 3. **Define Key Results**\n   - **Key Results are Measurable Milestones**: For each objective, define key results that will help you measure progress toward achieving that objective. Key results should be specific, measurable, and time-bound.\n   - **Use SMART Criteria**: Ensure your key results are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.\n   - **Keep Key Results Quantitative**: Where possible, use quantitative metrics to track progress. For example, if your objective is to increase sales, a key result might be \u201cincrease sales revenue by 15%.\u201d\n   - **Limit Key Results**: Typically, each objective should have between 2-5 key results. Too many key results can dilute focus and make it harder to track progress.\n\n### 4. **Involve Your Team**\n   - **Collaborate with Stakeholders**: Involve your team members and stakeholders in the OKR-setting process. This ensures buy-in and helps everyone understand how their contributions align with the overall goals.\n   - **Encourage Open Communication**: Create an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing ideas and concerns. This can lead to better collaboration and more innovative solutions.\n\n### 5. **Set Deadlines**\n   - **Establish Timeframes**: OKRs should have clear deadlines. This helps ensure that the team is focused and motivated to meet the objectives within the specified timeframe.\n   - **Quarterly Review Cycle**: Traditionally, OKRs are set for a quarter (3 months) and reviewed at the end of that period. However, some teams may choose shorter or longer cycles based on their needs.\n\n### 6. **Monitor Progress**\n   - **Regular Check-ins**: Schedule regular check-ins to review progress against key results. This helps identify any issues early and allows for adjustments if necessary.\n   - **Use OKR Software**: Consider using OKR software tools like OKRs, Airtable, or Google Sheets to track progress, collaborate, and visualize OKRs.\n\n### 7. **Review and Adjust**\n   - **Evaluate Performance**: At the end of the OKR cycle, evaluate the performance of both objectives and key results. Did you achieve the objectives? If not, why?\n   - **Adjust for Future Cycles**: Based on the evaluation, adjust your OKRs for the next cycle. This could mean revising objectives, adding new ones, or adjusting key results.\n\n### 8. **Celebrate Successes**\n   - **Acknowledge Achievements**: Celebrate successes and recognize the hard work of your team. This fosters a positive culture and encourages continued effort.\n\n### Example OKR Structure:\n- **Objective**: Increase customer satisfaction.\n- **Key Results**:\n  1. Increase customer feedback score by 10%.\n  2. Reduce customer support response time to under 2 hours.\n  3. Achieve a 95% first-time issue resolution rate.\n\nBy following this process, you can create OKRs that are aligned with your team\u2019s capabilities and the organization\u2019s strategic goals.", "shortest_response": "Developing Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) is a structured process that helps align your team's efforts with the organization's goals.

This move was likely driven by concerns about Egypt's ability to maintain control over such a powerful warship, given its strategic importance.\n- **Design and Specifications**: The vessel was a **turret ship**, meaning it had rotating gun turrets that allowed the guns to be aimed in any direction without the need to rotate the entire ship. It was armed with:\n  - Two **229 mm (9-inch)** Armstrong guns\n  - Two **178 mm (7-inch)** Armstrong guns\n\n### Service in the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)\n- **Deployment**: During the **Russo-Turkish War**, Hifz-ur Rahman was deployed on the **Danube River** to defend key Ottoman positions and prevent Russian forces from crossing the river.\n- **Action at Sulina**: The ship engaged in an **inconclusive action** against Russian gunboats while defending the port of **Sulina**.

It is mentioned in a Sydney Morning Herald restaurant column published in 1978. It is not mentioned in encyclopedias and dictionaries of the 1970s, first appearing in an Italian dictionary in 1980, and in English in 1982. It is mentioned in a 1983 cookbook devoted to cooking of the Veneto.\n\nObituaries for the restaurateur Ado Campeol (1928\u20132021) reported that it was invented at his restaurant Le Beccherie in Treviso on 24 December 1969 by his wife Alba di Pillo (1929\u20132021) and the pastry chef Roberto Linguanotto. The dish was added to its menu in 1972. Accounts by Carminantonio Iannaccone claim the tiramisu sold at Le Beccherie was made by him in his bakery, created on 24 December 1969.\n\nIt has been claimed that tiramisu has aphrodisiac effects and was concocted by a 19th-century Treviso brothel madam, as the Accademia Del Tiramis\u00f9 explains, to \"solve the problems they may have had with their conjugal duties on their return to their wives\".\n\nThere is evidence of a \"Tiremes\u00f9\" semi-frozen dessert served by the Vetturino restaurant in Pieris, in the Friuli Venezia Giulia, since 1938. This may be the name's origin, while the recipe for Tiramisu may have originated as a variation of another layered dessert, Zuppa Inglese. Others claim it was created towards the end of the 17th century in Siena in honour of Grand Duke Cosimo III.\n\nOn 29 July 2017, Tiramisu was entered by the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies on the list of traditional Friulian and Giulian agri-food products in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region. In 2013, Luca Zaia, governor of Veneto sought European Union Protected Status certification for the dessert, based on the ingredients used in 1970, so substitute ingredients, such as strawberries, could not be used in a dish called tiramisu", "longest_response": "When it comes to choosing between Tiramisu with chocolate and Tiramisu with strawberries, both options have their own merits and appeal, depending on personal preference. Let\u2019s break down the considerations for each:\n\n### Tiramisu with Chocolate:\n- **Classic Flavor Profile**: Traditional tiramisu is often associated with a rich, dark chocolate flavor. The combination of mascarpone, coffee-soaked ladyfingers, and a dusting of cocoa powder or shaved chocolate creates a decadent and indulgent dessert.\n- **Aphrodisiac Reputation**: Some sources suggest that tiramisu might have aphrodisiac properties, which could make it even more appealing for special occasions or romantic settings.\n- **Versatility**: Chocolate tiramisu can be adapted to various tastes, such as adding dark, milk, or white chocolate, or incorporating different types of cocoa.\n\n### Tiramisu with Strawberries:\n- **Freshness and Lightness**: Adding fresh strawberries brings a burst of freshness and lightness to the dessert. Strawberries complement the creamy texture of the mascarpone and provide a refreshing contrast to the coffee and chocolate elements.\n- **Seasonal Appeal**: Strawberries are often associated with spring and summer, making this version particularly appealing during warmer months.\n- **Healthier Option**: For those looking for a slightly healthier option, strawberries can add a touch of vitamins and antioxidants, though the overall calorie count remains high due to the richness of the mascarpone.\n\n### Context and Authenticity:\nGiven the historical context provided, the classic tiramisu is more closely aligned with the traditional recipe that includes layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers, mascarpone cheese, and cocoa powder. However, the inclusion of strawberries in a tiramisu-like dessert does have historical precedent, especially considering mentions of similar desserts like Tiremes\u00f9 from the early 20th century.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUltimately, the choice between chocolate and strawberry depends on personal taste and the occasion. If you're looking for something richer and more traditional, go for the chocolate version. If you want a lighter, fresher, and perhaps more seasonal option, the strawberry version would be a great choice. Both versions remain delicious and beloved by many, so the decision should come down to what you and your diners prefer!", "shortest_response": "When it comes to choosing between Tiramisu with chocolate or with strawberries, the preference largely depends on personal taste. Both versions are popular and have their own unique flavors:\n\n1. **Tiramisu with Chocolate**: \n   - This version typically features a rich, dark chocolate sauce or ganache drizzled over the layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers and mascarpone cream. The chocolate adds a decadent and bitter-sweet contrast to the sweet and creamy mascarpone.\n   - Chocolate lovers often prefer this version due to its bold and intense flavor.\n\n2. **Tiramisu with Strawberries**:\n   - A strawberry version usually includes fresh strawberries added to the layers, either whole or pureed into the mascarpone mixture. The sweetness of the strawberries pairs well with the coffee and mascarpone, creating a lighter and fresher taste.\n   - Fans of fruity desserts or those looking for a less heavy option might enjoy this version.\n\nGiven the historical context and the traditional recipe, the classic version of Tiramisu uses cocoa powder and coffee, which are key components of the original recipe. However, variations like adding strawberries can enhance the dessert with a refreshing twist.\n\nIf you're looking for authenticity, the traditional version without strawberries is generally considered more classic.

You can leverage other materials, but the exterior of both the fuselage and the wings must be duct tape.", "longest_response": "Building a functional plane entirely out of duct tape is an ambitious project, but it's definitely doable with creativity and some clever engineering. The challenge lies in ensuring that the structure is strong enough to withstand the stresses of flight, while also being lightweight. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how you could approach building such a plane:\n\n### 1. **Conceptual Design**\n   - **Scale**: Start by deciding the scale of your model. A small-scale model (e.g., 1:10) will be easier to manage and will have less stringent requirements for strength.\n   - **Basic Airfoil Shape**: Sketch the basic airfoil shape for the wings and tail surfaces. The wing should have a slight camber (curvature) to generate lift.\n\n### 2. **Materials Needed**\n   - **Duct Tape**: For the exterior skin of the fuselage and wings.\n   - **Lightweight Core Material**: For internal support structures. Possible materials include:\n     - **Foam**: Lightweight and provides good insulation.\n     - **Balsa Wood**: Provides structural integrity without adding too much weight.\n     - **Cardboard**: Can be used for ribs and spars.\n     - **Wire**: For reinforcing structures.\n     - **Hot Glue or Super Glue**: To hold components together.\n     - **Rubber Bands or Fishing Line**: For simple tension-based mechanisms.\n     - **Small Motors and Propellers**: For propulsion (optional).\n\n### 3. **Fuselage Construction**\n   - **Core Structure**: \n     - Use cardboard or balsa wood to create the basic shape of the fuselage. Cut pieces to fit the length and width of the plane.\n     - Reinforce the core with wire or additional cardboard pieces where necessary.\n   - **Skinning**:\n     - Wrap the entire fuselage with duct tape, starting from the bottom and working your way up. Make sure the tape overlaps by at least 1 inch to ensure a strong bond.\n     - Smooth out any wrinkles or bubbles as you go.\n\n### 4. **Wing Construction**\n   - **Core Structure**:\n     - Create a basic wing shape using cardboard or balsa wood. The wing should be slightly curved on top and flat on the bottom to mimic the airfoil shape.\n     - Reinforce the wing with wire or additional cardboard pieces where necessary.\n   - **Skinning**:\n     - Wrap the entire wing with duct tape, starting from the leading edge and working your way to the trailing edge. Ensure the tape overlaps by at least 1 inch.\n     - Use multiple layers of tape to reinforce areas that will experience more stress, such as the tips of the wings.\n   - **Ribs and Spar**:\n     - Add internal ribs made of thin cardboard or balsa wood to give the wing its shape and rigidity.\n     - Attach the ribs to the spar (a central piece of wood or wire that runs along the length of the wing) using hot glue or super glue.\n\n### 5. **Tail Surfaces**\n   - **Horizontal Stabilizer**:\n     - Create a horizontal stabilizer (tail fin) using cardboard or balsa wood, and wrap it with duct tape.\n   - **Vertical Stabilizer**:\n     - Create a vertical stabilizer (fin) using cardboard or balsa wood, and wrap it with duct tape.\n   - **Rudder and Elevator**:\n     - Attach a rudder (vertical control surface) and elevator (horizontal control surface) to the tail using wire or cardboard tabs.\n     - Wrap these control surfaces with duct tape for strength.\n\n### 6. **Propulsion System**\n   - **Manual Propeller**:\n     - If you want to fly the plane manually, you can attach a small propeller to the back of the fuselage using duct tape. You can manually spin the propeller to generate thrust.\n   - **Electric Propeller**:\n     - If you have access to small motors and propellers, you can mount a small electric motor on the fuselage and attach a propeller to it. Use duct tape to secure the motor and propeller to the fuselage.\n\n### 7. **Testing and Flight**\n   - **Ground Testing**: Before attempting to fly the plane, test it on the ground to ensure all components are securely attached and the structure is stable.\n   - **Flight Testing**: Once you're confident in the design, try flying the plane indoors in a controlled environment. Be prepared for adjustments and modifications based on flight performance.\n\n### 8. **Modifications**\n   - **Weight Reduction**: If the plane is too heavy, consider replacing heavier materials like cardboard with lighter alternatives.\n   - **Stability Improvements**: If the plane is unstable in flight, you may need to adjust the balance by moving the center of gravity closer to the wings or adding more weight to the nose.\n\n### Tips:\n- **Tension**: Duct tape is strongest when stretched. Try to stretch the tape as you apply it to increase its strength.\n- **Overlapping**: Overlap each layer of tape by at least 1 inch to ensure a strong bond.\n- **Heat**: Applying heat from a hairdryer can help seal the tape and improve its adhesion.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBuilding a plane out of duct tape is a fun and creative project, but it requires careful planning and attention to detail. While it won\u2019t be as strong or efficient as a traditionally built aircraft, it can still fly with some effort. Enjoy the process of experimentation and learning!", "shortest_response": "Building a functional aircraft out of duct tape alone is not feasible due to the limitations in strength, weight, and aerodynamics. However, I can guide you on how to construct a small, non-functional model or a decorative toy plane using duct tape as the primary material for the fuselage and wings. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Materials Needed:\n- Duct tape (various colors)\n- Lightweight paper or cardboard (for the wings and stabilizers)\n- Scissors\n- Glue or double-sided tape (optional)\n- Marker (for decoration)\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide:\n\n#### 1. **Design the Plane:**\n   - Sketch your plane design on paper. A simple biplane or monoplane with two wings and a tail is a good starting point.\n   - Decide on the size and scale of your plane.\n\n#### 2. **Prepare the Wings and Stabilizers:**\n   - Cut lightweight paper or cardboard into the shape of wings and stabilizers (tail, rudder, elevator).\n   - Use these pieces as templates to create the same shapes from duct tape.\n\n#### 3. **Build the Fuselage:**\n   - Start by creating the body of the plane using duct tape. Roll up several layers of duct tape to form a cylindrical shape. This will serve as the fuselage.\n   - Flatten the ends of the cylinder to form the front and back of the fuselage. Secure the ends with additional layers of duct tape.\n   - If needed, reinforce the structure with extra layers of tape.\n\n#### 4. **Attach the Wings and Stabilizers:**\n   - Use duct tape to attach the wings to the fuselage. The wings should be attached at an angle to simulate flight.\n   - Attach the stabilizers (tail, rudder, and elevator) to the back of the fuselage. Again, use duct tape to secure them.\n\n#### 5. **Decorate the Plane:**\n   - Use markers to add details such as cockpit windows, propellers, and any other decorations you like.\n\n#### 6. **Test Flight (Non-Functional):**\n   - For a non-functional model, you can try to launch it by throwing it gently. If you want to make it more aerodynamic, you can add small paper clips or other lightweight materials to balance it.\n\n### Tips:\n- **Strength:** While duct tape is strong when adhered properly, it is not suitable for high-stress areas like the wings and fuselage. Use lightweight materials for these parts.\n- **Weight:** Keep the plane as light as possible by using thin materials for the wings and stabilizers.\n- **Aerodynamics:** A simple design with a flat bottom and pointed top will help with stability during \"flight.\"\n\nThis project is more about creativity and learning than practicality.

Here are a few reasons why dogs could be considered better for physical health:\n\n### 1. **Encourages Regular Exercise:**\n   - **Dogs Need Walks:** Dogs typically require regular walks, runs, or playtime, which encourages their owners to stay active. This consistent physical activity can help improve cardiovascular health, strengthen muscles, and maintain a healthy weight.\n   - **Cats Are More Independent:** While cats also need exercise, they tend to be more independent and may not always seek out opportunities for physical activity like dogs do.\n\n### 2. **Reduces Blood Pressure and Stress:**\n   - **Physical Touch:** Dogs often initiate physical contact with their owners, such as nuzzling, licking, or cuddling, which can release oxytocin (the \"feel-good\" hormone) and reduce stress hormones like cortisol.\n   - **Regular Interaction:** The consistent presence of a dog can provide a sense of routine and companionship, which may help lower blood pressure and reduce stress levels over time.\n\n### 3. **Social Interaction:**\n   - **Dog Parks and Dog-Friendly Spaces:** Dogs often go to dog parks, dog-friendly cafes, or other social spaces, providing opportunities for their owners to meet other people. Social interaction can contribute to overall physical and mental health by reducing feelings of isolation and loneliness.\n   - **Cats Are Less Social:** Cats are generally more solitary and may not encourage the same level of social interaction as dogs.\n\n### 4. **Immunological Benefits:**\n   - **Early Exposure to Allergens:** Research has shown that early exposure to dogs may help build stronger immune systems and reduce the risk of developing allergies later in life. In contrast, while cats can also help with allergies, the evidence for this is less strong.\n\n### 5. **Support During Physical Activities:**\n   - **Companionship During Workouts:** Dogs can serve as excellent workout partners, whether it's going for long walks, hiking, or playing fetch. This can make exercise more enjoyable and consistent.\n   - **Cats Are Less Likely to Engage in Physical Activities:** Cats are generally more sedentary and may not be as enthusiastic about engaging in physical activities with their owners.\n\n### 6. **Increased Physical Activity Indoors:**\n   - **Dogs Require Indoor Play:** Even if you live in an apartment or small home, dogs can still engage in indoor activities like fetch, tug-of-war, or simply chasing toys. This keeps them\u2014and you\u2014physically active indoors.\n   - **Cats Are Often More Sedentary Indoors:** While cats can be playful, they tend to prefer lounging and may not engage in as much physical activity indoors.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile both dogs and cats can positively impact a person's physical health, dogs tend to be more active companions that encourage regular exercise, social interaction, and stress reduction. However, the best pet for your physical health depends on individual lifestyle, preferences, and living conditions. Ultimately, the bond between a person and their pet is what truly matters for overall well-being.", "shortest_response": "Dogs are often considered better than cats for a person's physical health due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Increased Physical Activity**: Dogs typically require regular walks, runs, or playtime, which encourages their owners to engage in more physical activity. This can lead to improved cardiovascular health, weight management, and overall fitness.\n\n2. **Stress Reduction**: Interacting with dogs has been shown to reduce stress and lower blood pressure. The unconditional love and companionship provided by dogs can also improve mental well-being, which indirectly benefits physical health.\n\n3. **Social Interaction**: Owning a dog can increase opportunities for social interaction, whether it's walking the dog, meeting other dog owners at parks, or participating in dog-related activities. Social connections are important for mental and physical health.\n\n4. **Immune System Boost**: Early exposure to dogs, especially during childhood, has been linked to a stronger immune system due to increased contact with bacteria and allergens, which can help protect against certain diseases.\n\n5. **Emotional Support**: Dogs provide emotional support and comfort, which can improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. Positive emotions contribute to better physical health over time.\n\nWhile cats can also offer emotional support and have their own unique health benefits (such as reducing allergies in some people), dogs tend to be more active and require more physical engagement from their owners, which is why they are often credited with having a greater impact on physical health.

The earliest known video game Easter egg is in Moonlander (1973), in which the player tries to land a Lunar module on the moon; if the player opts to fly the module horizontally through several of the game's screens, they encounter a McDonald's restaurant, and if they land next to it the astronaut will visit it instead of standing next to the ship. The earliest known Easter egg in software in general is one placed in the \"make\" command for PDP-6/PDP-10 computers sometime in October 1967\u2013October 1968, wherein if the user attempts to create a file named \"love\" by typing \"make love\", the program responds \"not war?\" before proceeding.", "longest_response": "The concept of an Easter egg in video games and software has a rich history that dates back several decades. As you mentioned, the term was popularized in the early 1980s, but its origins can be traced even further.\n\n### Early Origins\n\n1. **Moonlander (1973)**: One of the earliest known examples of an Easter egg is found in the game *Moonlander*. If the player flies horizontally through certain screens, they encounter a McDonald's restaurant. Landing next to this restaurant causes the astronaut to enter the restaurant instead of standing by the ship. This subtle inclusion reflects the developers' sense of humor and their desire to add an extra layer of fun for players who took the time to explore the game thoroughly.\n\n2. **PDP-6/PDP-10 Computers (1967-1968)**: The earliest known Easter egg in software was discovered on PDP-6 and PDP-10 computers. If a user typed \"make love\" in the \"make\" command prompt, the system would respond with \"not war?\" This playful response is believed to have been added as a humorous nod to the cultural climate of the time, especially given the ongoing Vietnam War.\n\n### Video Games and Easter Eggs\n\nAs video games became more popular, developers began incorporating Easter eggs into their titles to engage players and reward those who took the time to explore beyond the main gameplay. These hidden features could range from simple messages to complex mini-games or additional content.\n\n- **Adventure (1979)**: The game *Adventure* by Warren Robinett for the Atari 2600 is often credited with coining the term \"Easter egg.\" The hidden message \"CREATOR WARREN ROBINETT\" was placed in a difficult-to-reach part of the game, reflecting the developers' efforts to include a personal touch while challenging players.\n\n- **The Legend of Zelda (1986)**: In *The Legend of Zelda*, players could find hidden items like a \"Goron's Hat\" or \"Zora's Flippers,\" which were not necessary for completing the game but added depth and exploration.\n\n### Cultural Impact\n\nEaster eggs have become an integral part of gaming culture, serving both as a form of developer communication and as a way to reward dedicated players. They have evolved from simple messages to complex in-game features, challenges, and references to other media. Easter eggs continue to be a beloved tradition in the gaming world, adding an extra layer of enjoyment and discovery for enthusiasts.\n\nIn summary, while the term \"Easter egg\" was popularized in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the concept itself has roots in earlier software and hardware development, where developers would include hidden features as a form of creativity and engagement.", "shortest_response": "The origin of the Easter egg in video games can be traced back to early days of computer programming and gaming development. As you mentioned, the term \"Easter egg\" was coined around 1979 by Steve Wright, who was the Director of Software Development at Atari. This term was used to describe hidden messages or features intentionally placed in software as a playful gesture or as a way for developers to include personal touches or inside jokes.\n\nThe earliest known example of an Easter egg in a video game dates back to 1973 with the game **Moonlander**. In this game, players control a lunar module attempting to land on the moon. If the player flies horizontally through several screens, they encounter a McDonald's restaurant, and if they land next to it, the astronaut will visit the restaurant instead of standing next to the module. This hidden feature demonstrates how early developers were already experimenting with adding these playful elements to their games.\n\nIn the broader context of software, the concept of Easter eggs has roots that go even further back. One of the earliest known Easter eggs in software appears to be from the \"make\" command for PDP-6/PDP-10 computers, which dates back to sometime between October 1967 and October 1968. If a user types \"make love\" instead of creating a file, the system responds with \"not war?\"\u2014a humorous message that predates the video game industry but set a precedent for including such hidden elements in code.\n\nThese early examples illustrate how Easter eggs have evolved from simple, playful additions to software to more elaborate and complex features found in modern video games, often serving as tributes to the developers, as references to pop culture, or as hidden treasures for dedicated players to discover.", "input_size": 263, "output_sizes": [442, 496, 362, 578, 489, 405, 361, 484, 418, 358], "output_mean": 439.3, "output_std": 68.76, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 372.75, "p50": 430.0, "p75": 487.75, "p99": 570.62}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "closed_qa", "gen_time": 12.98071}, {"sample_id": "a9afef8647de8928", "prompt_id": "16ac1f397666d1e5", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "From this paragraph please summarize the notable California regions where pinot noir is produced.\nContext: Pinot noir's home is France's Burgundy region, particularly C\u00f4te-d'Or.

My views on parenting are informed by research, psychology, and the diverse experiences of parents around the world. Here are some key perspectives:\n\n### 1. **Love and Emotional Support**\n   - Parenting begins with love. Children need to feel loved, valued, and secure in their relationships with their parents. Emotional support helps them develop resilience, self-esteem, and the ability to navigate challenges.\n   - Being present and attentive to a child\u2019s emotional needs fosters healthy attachment and trust.\n\n### 2. **Setting Boundaries and Limits**\n   - While love is essential, setting clear boundaries is equally important. Boundaries help children understand expectations, learn responsibility, and develop self-discipline. Consistent enforcement of rules teaches children the importance of following guidelines.\n   - However, it\u2019s important to balance discipline with understanding. Children should be given reasons for rules and opportunities to reflect on their actions.\n\n### 3. **Encouraging Independence and Autonomy**\n   - As children grow, parents should gradually encourage independence. This means allowing children to make choices, solve problems, and face natural consequences when appropriate. Independence fosters confidence and self-reliance.\n   - Encouraging autonomy doesn\u2019t mean being permissive; it involves guiding children toward responsible decision-making while still providing support.\n\n### 4. **Modeling Behavior**\n   - Children learn a great deal from observing their parents. Parents should model the behaviors they want to see in their children, such as kindness, empathy, integrity, and perseverance. Actions speak louder than words.\n   - Consistency in behavior is crucial. Children notice when parents say one thing but do another, which can lead to confusion or distrust.\n\n### 5. **Flexibility and Adaptability**\n   - No two children are the same, and what works for one may not work for another. Parenting requires flexibility and adaptability. Understanding your child\u2019s unique personality, strengths, and challenges is key to effective parenting.\n   - Being open to learning and adjusting your approach based on new information or changing circumstances is important.\n\n### 6. **Communication**\n   - Open and honest communication is vital. Children need to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts, feelings, and concerns with their parents. This helps build trust and strengthens the parent-child relationship.\n   - Active listening is also important. Parents should listen without judgment and respond thoughtfully to their children\u2019s needs and questions.\n\n### 7. **Emphasizing Education and Curiosity**\n   - Encouraging curiosity and a love for learning is crucial. Parents can foster intellectual growth by exposing children to different ideas, encouraging critical thinking, and promoting a growth mindset.\n   - Providing educational resources, whether through books, schools, or extracurricular activities, can help children develop skills and knowledge that will serve them throughout life.\n\n### 8. **Balancing Protection and Exposure**\n   - While it\u2019s important to protect children from harm, it\u2019s equally important to allow them to experience the world and take reasonable risks. This helps them develop problem-solving skills and build confidence.\n   - Parents should strike a balance between protecting their children from danger and helping them learn how to navigate risks safely.\n\n### 9. **Fostering Social Skills**\n   - Children need to learn how to interact with others, both positively and appropriately. Parents can help by modeling good social behavior, encouraging cooperation, and teaching empathy.\n   - Social skills are essential for building strong relationships, both now and in adulthood.\n\n### 10. **Self-Care for Parents**\n   - Parenting can be demanding, and parents need to take care of themselves as well. Burnout can negatively impact both the parent and the child. Taking time for self-care, whether through hobbies, exercise, or simply taking breaks, is important for maintaining mental and emotional health.\n\n### Conclusion:\nParenting is a lifelong process that requires patience, empathy, and continuous learning. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and every family\u2019s journey is unique. The most successful parents are those who remain adaptable, open-minded, and committed to their children\u2019s well-being. Ultimately, the goal is to raise confident, compassionate, and capable individuals who can thrive in the world.\n\nWhat aspects of parenting resonate with you the most, or are there specific areas you'd like to explore further?", "shortest_response": "Parenting is a deeply personal and complex journey that varies widely depending on cultural, social, and individual beliefs.

Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995, Vapnik et al., 1997[citation needed]) SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods, being based on statistical learning frameworks or VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974). Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n\nIn addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\nThe support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data.[citation needed] These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data to groups and, then, to map new data according to these clusters.", "longest_response": "Support Vector Machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a type of supervised learning model used for classification and regression tasks in machine learning. They were developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik and his colleagues in the early 1990s. SVMs are particularly noted for their robustness and effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces, which makes them suitable for complex datasets.\n\n### Key Concepts of SVM:\n\n1. **Classification**: SVMs are primarily used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to separate data points into two categories. The fundamental idea behind SVM is to find the hyperplane that best separates the data points of different classes with the maximum margin.\n\n2. **Hyperplane and Margin**: In a two-dimensional space, a line acts as a hyperplane; in three dimensions, a plane acts as a hyperplane, and so on. SVM finds the hyperplane that maximizes the margin, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data point from either class. These nearest points are called \"support vectors.\"\n\n3. **Linear Separation**: When the data is linearly separable, SVM finds the optimal hyperplane that separates the data points of different classes. This is done by minimizing the classification error while maximizing the margin.\n\n4. **Non-Linear Separation**: For non-linearly separable data, SVM uses a technique called the \"kernel trick.\" This involves transforming the input space into a higher-dimensional space where the data becomes linearly separable. Common kernels include polynomial kernels, radial basis function (RBF) kernels, and sigmoid kernels.\n\n5. **Support Vectors**: Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary (hyperplane). They are crucial because the position of the hyperplane is determined by these points alone. Removing any support vector will change the position of the hyperplane.\n\n6. **VC Theory**: SVMs are based on the concept of Vapnik\u2013Chervonenkis (VC) theory, which provides a framework for understanding the capacity of a model to generalize from a finite number of training examples to unseen data. This theory helps in determining the complexity of the model to avoid overfitting.\n\n### Applications:\n- **Text Classification**: SVMs are widely used in text classification tasks, such as spam detection and sentiment analysis.\n- **Image Recognition**: They are effective in image recognition tasks, where they can classify images into different categories.\n- **Bioinformatics**: SVMs are used in bioinformatics for tasks like gene classification and protein structure prediction.\n- **Handwriting Recognition**: They have been successfully applied in handwriting recognition systems.\n\n### Support Vector Clustering:\nThe support vector clustering (SVC) algorithm, introduced by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, extends the principles of SVM to unsupervised learning. SVC aims to categorize unlabeled data into clusters by identifying support vectors that represent the densest regions of the data. This approach helps in mapping new data points into existing clusters based on their proximity to these support vectors.\n\nIn summary, SVMs are powerful tools for classification and regression tasks, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data.

The `input_timestamp` function extracts the timestamp of the record as it is received by the Spark streaming job.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can use it:\n\n### Example:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n    .appName(\"StructuredStreamingExample\") \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n\n# Assume you have a source that provides events with a timestamp (e.g., Kafka)\ndf = spark.readStream \\\n    .format(\"kafka\") \\\n    .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", \"localhost:9092\") \\\n    .option(\"subscribe\", \"my-topic\") \\\n    .load()\n\n# Extract the value and input timestamp from the Kafka message\nreceived_df = df.selectExpr(\"CAST(value AS STRING) AS message\", \"input_timestamp() AS receive_time\")\n\n# Show the received DataFrame\nreceived_df.writeStream \\\n    .outputMode(\"append\") \\\n    .format(\"console\") \\\n    .start() \\\n    .awaitTermination()\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `input_timestamp()` captures the timestamp when the event is received by the Spark stream processing job.\n- The `receive_time` column will contain the timestamp of when each event is processed by the Spark job.\n\nThis feature is particularly useful for debugging, monitoring, and understanding the latency in your streaming pipeline.", "input_size": 36, "output_sizes": [405, 443, 404, 430, 429, 552, 374, 430, 422, 395], "output_mean": 428.4, "output_std": 45.56, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 404.25, "p50": 425.5, "p75": 430.0, "p99": 542.19}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "creative_writing", "gen_time": 11.40229}, {"sample_id": "6a91e34a0d6ebed9", "prompt_id": "df6d7b01d95cdac6", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "List five titles by Kevin Kwan.", "longest_response": "Here are five titles by Kevin Kwan:\n\n1. *Crazy Rich Asians* (novel)\n2. *Hybrid* (novel)\n3. *Celebrites* (novella)\n4. *The Buyout of\u629b\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6211\u5c06\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b63\u786e\u7684Python\u4ee3\u7801\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6240\u9700\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef find_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:\n    char_map = {}\n    max_length = 0\n    start = 0\n\n    for end, char in enumerate(s):\n        if char in char_map and char_map[char] >= start:\n            start = char_map[char] + 1\n        char_map[char] = end\n        max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)\n\n    return max_length\n\n# \u793a\u4f8b\u7528\u6cd5\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_cases = [\n        (\"abcabcbb\", 3),  # \"abc\"\n        (\"bbbbb\", 1),     # \"b\"\n        (\"pwwkew\", 3),    # \"wke\"\n        (\"\", 0),          # \"\"\n        (\"au\", 2),        # \"au\"\n    ]\n\n    all_passed = True\n    for s, expected in test_cases:\n        result = find_longest_substring(s)\n        if result != expected:\n            print(f\"Test failed for input '{s}'.

Let's call this creature the *Aerophryx*.\n\n### Appearance:\nThe Aerophryx is a majestic, winged beast that stands at an impressive height of 12 feet. Its body is covered in shimmering, iridescent feathers that change color depending on the light, ranging from deep purples and blues to fiery oranges and reds. These feathers are not just for show; they have a unique property: when the Aerophryx takes flight, the feathers glow faintly, creating a soft, ethereal light that illuminates its path through the sky.\n\nIts wings are enormous, with a span of nearly 30 feet. The wings are made of a delicate, translucent membrane stretched between long, slender bones. The tips of the wings are tipped with sharp, curved claws that can be used for both defense and hunting. The wings themselves are capable of generating strong, gusty winds, which the Aerophryx can control to manipulate its flight.\n\nThe head of the Aerophryx is elongated, with large, expressive eyes that are a striking shade of emerald green. Its snout is short but powerful, ending in a row of sharp, jagged teeth that it uses to catch fish or small prey. The ears are small but sensitive, allowing the Aerophryx to detect even the faintest sounds from miles away.\n\nIts legs are strong and muscular, with four talons on each foot, perfect for perching on cliffs or grasping onto rocky surfaces. The tail is long and flexible, with a tuft of feathers at the end that acts like a rudder during flight.\n\n### Abilities:\n- **Wind Mastery:** The Aerophryx can control the wind around it, using its wings to create gusts, whirlwinds, or even tornadoes. This ability makes it a formidable force in battle, as it can use the wind to attack or defend itself.\n  \n- **Elemental Breath:** It can breathe fire, ice, or lightning, depending on its mood or the situation. Each breath is accompanied by a burst of energy that can level trees or freeze the ground beneath it.\n\n- **Healing Touch:** The Aerophryx\u2019s feathers contain a special essence that can heal wounds and restore vitality. If an injured creature touches one of its feathers, it begins to mend itself almost instantly.\n\n- **Telepathic Communication:** The Aerophryx has a telepathic connection with all living creatures within a 5-mile radius. It can communicate with birds, animals, and even plants, making it a master of diplomacy and negotiation.\n\n### Habitat:\nThe Aerophryx lives in high mountain ranges, where it can find secluded cliffs and caves to call home. It prefers to fly over vast open skies, where it can hunt for food or simply enjoy the freedom of the air. However, it also has a deep connection to the forests below, often visiting them to tend to the plants and animals that live there.\n\n### Personality:\nThe Aerophryx is a wise and ancient creature, often seen as a guardian of nature. It is peaceful by nature, preferring to avoid conflict unless absolutely necessary. When it does fight, it does so with grace and precision, never harming more than it needs to. It values balance and harmony, and often serves as a mediator between warring factions or as a protector of the environment.\n\nIn many cultures, the Aerophryx is revered as a symbol of strength, wisdom, and beauty. It is said that those who encounter an Aerophryx are blessed with good fortune and are guided toward paths of peace and understanding.\n\n### Role in the World:\nThe Aerophryx plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of nature. It helps regulate the weather patterns, ensuring that the seasons change appropriately and that the ecosystems remain healthy. It is also known to protect sacred sites and ancient landmarks, ensuring that they are preserved for future generations.\n\nIn some stories, the Aerophryx is said to be the embodiment of the spirits of the mountains and the sky, a reminder to humans of the importance of respecting the natural world.", "shortest_response": "Sure! Let's imagine a creature called the *Aeriswift*.\n\nThe Aeriswift is a majestic, ethereal creature that blends elements of both bird and dragon. Its body is long and sleek, with scales that shimmer in shades of silver and gold, catching the light like stars. Its wings are enormous, translucent membranes that glisten with iridescent hues of blue and green, almost as if they are alive with the reflection of the sky and sea. These wings are not just for flight; they can also manipulate wind currents, allowing the Aeriswift to glide effortlessly through the air or create gusts strong enough to push back against the strongest winds.\n\nThe Aeriswift has a long, serpentine neck adorned with delicate feathers that trail behind it like a crown of soft, glowing light. Its eyes are large and luminous, glowing softly with an inner fire that can shift between warm amber and cool sapphire, depending on its mood. The creature's legs are powerful and clawed, ending in talons that are sharp but not deadly, more suited to grasping than harming. It moves with grace and elegance, almost as if it floats above the ground rather than walking upon it.\n\nThe Aeriswift's most unique feature is its tail, which resembles a long, flowing stream of water when it's not in use. However, this tail can also transform into a powerful whip made of solidified wind, capable of slicing through obstacles with ease. This tail is also used to communicate with other creatures, sending vibrations through the air that can be felt by those nearby.\n\nIn terms of personality, the Aeriswift is a peaceful and wise creature, often seen as a guardian of nature. It is known to appear during times of great need, offering guidance and protection to those who respect the balance of the world. Its presence brings calm and clarity, and many believe that encountering an Aeriswift is a sign of good fortune.\n\nIn the fantasy world, the Aeriswift is revered by both humans and nature spirits. They are said to have the ability to heal the land and restore harmony to ecosystems that have been disrupted. Legends tell of Aeriswifts helping to rebuild forests after fires, calming storms, and even guiding lost travelers to safety.\n\nOverall, the Aeriswift is a symbol of balance, harmony, and the power of nature, embodying the delicate yet powerful relationship between the elements of wind, earth, and spirit.", "input_size": 24, "output_sizes": [842, 666, 636, 636, 809, 672, 506, 599, 599, 686], "output_mean": 665.1, "output_std": 93.93, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 608.25, "p50": 651.0, "p75": 682.5, "p99": 839.03}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "creative_writing", "gen_time": 18.25932}, {"sample_id": "b5a1f2843133ca15", "prompt_id": "9c2aa9e411faf33e", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What are the main components of Apache Spark based on the paragraph?\nContext: Apache Spark requires a cluster manager and a distributed storage system.

This corrosion can lead to the formation of aluminum oxide, which is an extremely poor conductor of electricity. Over time, this can cause the wire to become brittle and increase the risk of electrical arcing.\n\n2. **Expansion and Contraction**: Aluminum expands and contracts more than copper when exposed to temperature changes. This can cause connections to loosen over time, leading to poor contact and increased resistance. Poor contact can result in overheating, which may further accelerate corrosion and potentially cause fires.\n\n3. **Increased Resistance**: Aluminum has higher electrical resistance than copper, meaning it requires more energy to conduct the same amount of electricity. This increased resistance can lead to higher temperatures at the connections, increasing the risk of fire.\n\n4. **Arcing and Sparks**: As mentioned, the combination of corrosion, expansion, and increased resistance can lead to arcing and sparking at connections. These sparks can ignite surrounding materials, posing a significant fire hazard.\n\n5. **Older Wiring Standards**: When aluminum wiring was first introduced, it did not meet the same safety standards as copper wiring. This means that older homes with aluminum wiring were not designed with the same level of protection against potential hazards.\n\n### Signs of Aluminum Wiring Problems:\n- **Frequent Tripped Circuit Breakers**: If a circuit breaker trips frequently, it could indicate a problem with the wiring.\n- **Warm or Hot Outlets and Switches**: If outlets, switches, or other electrical devices feel warm to the touch, it could be a sign of a loose or corroded connection.\n- **Popping Noises**: Sometimes, you might hear popping noises coming from the panel or outlets, which can be a sign of arcing.\n- **Burning Smell**: A burning smell near electrical outlets or switches can be a red flag.\n\n### What Should You Do?\nIf your home has aluminum wiring, it's important to have it evaluated by a qualified electrician.

Here\u2019s a breakdown of some key differences:\n\n### 1. **Density and Crowds**\n   - **New York City**: NYC is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. You're likely to encounter crowds, especially during peak hours or in popular areas like Times Square, Central Park, or Lower Manhattan. The subway system can be busy, and streets are often crowded.\n   - **Other Cities**: Smaller cities or suburbs tend to have more space between people and places. For example, in a city like Denver or Nashville, you might find more open spaces and less congestion, though you may still experience crowds in tourist areas or during special events.\n\n### 2. **Cost of Living**\n   - **New York City**: NYC is one of the most expensive cities in the world. Housing costs are astronomical, and even public transportation can be pricey. Groceries, dining out, and entertainment are also generally more expensive than in other parts of the country.\n   - **Other Cities**: In contrast, many mid-sized or smaller cities offer a much lower cost of living. You might pay significantly less for rent, groceries, and other essentials. For example, a city like Portland, Oregon, or Austin, Texas, offers a more affordable lifestyle compared to NYC.\n\n### 3. **Public Transportation**\n   - **New York City**: The subway system is extensive but can be overcrowded, especially during rush hours. Buses are also an option, but they can be slow and unreliable due to traffic. However, public transportation is efficient, and there are plenty of options to get around the city.\n   - **Other Cities**: Many cities have excellent public transportation systems, but they may not be as extensive or frequent as NYC's. For example, in Los Angeles or Miami, buses and trains are available, but they don't cover as much ground as the subway does in NYC. In cities like Atlanta or Dallas, you might rely more on personal vehicles or ride-sharing services.\n\n### 4. **Weather and Seasons**\n   - **New York City**: NYC experiences all four seasons, but winters can be harsh with cold temperatures and snow. Summers are hot and humid, and spring and fall can be mild but unpredictable. Weather patterns can change quickly, and you need to be prepared for all conditions.\n   - **Other Cities**: Depending on where you go, weather can vary widely. In warmer climates like Florida or California, summers are consistently hot, while winters are mild. In colder regions like Chicago or Detroit, winters can be long and bitterly cold, and summers are often humid. Spring and fall in these cities are usually pleasant.\n\n### 5. **Culture and Entertainment**\n   - **New York City**: NYC is known as the cultural capital of the world. There are countless museums, theaters, concert halls, and art galleries. Broadway shows, concerts, and art exhibits are always happening, and there's a vibrant nightlife scene. The city is home to world-class restaurants and cafes, and you can find almost any cuisine imaginable.\n   - **Other Cities**: While many cities have their own unique cultural offerings, they may not have the same level of diversity or intensity as NYC. For example, San Francisco has a strong tech culture and a thriving arts scene, but it doesn't compare to NYC's sheer scale in terms of cultural diversity and artistic expression.\n\n### 6. **Safety**\n   - **New York City**: Safety can vary depending on the neighborhood. Some areas, like Midtown or Upper East Side, are relatively safe, but others, like certain parts of Brooklyn or the Bronx, can be more dangerous. Crime rates can fluctuate, and it's important to stay aware of your surroundings.\n   - **Other Cities**: Many cities, especially smaller ones, tend to have lower crime rates. For example, cities like Austin, Nashville, or Salt Lake City are often considered safer overall. However, larger cities like Los Angeles or Chicago may have higher crime rates in certain areas, similar to NYC.\n\n### 7. **Traffic and Driving**\n   - **New York City**: NYC is famous for its grid-like street layout, which makes driving challenging and often unnecessary. Public transportation is preferred, and parking can be difficult or expensive. Traffic congestion is common, especially during rush hours.\n   - **Other Cities**: In cities without subways or efficient public transit, driving is more common. Traffic can be heavy, especially in cities like Los Angeles or Atlanta, where highways are often congested. However, in smaller cities, you might not need a car at all, as public transportation is often sufficient.\n\n### 8. **Social Life and Community**\n   - **New York City**: NYC is a melting pot of cultures, and you can meet people from all over the world. The city is filled with diverse communities, and there are endless opportunities to connect with others through work, hobbies, or social activities. However, the fast pace of life can sometimes make it feel isolating.\n   - **Other Cities**: In smaller cities, people tend to know each other better, and there may be a stronger sense of community. Social life can be more relaxed, and you may find it easier to form lasting friendships. However, you might miss the diversity and cosmopolitan vibe that NYC offers.\n\n### 9. **Work-Life Balance**\n   - **New York City**: The fast-paced nature of NYC can lead to long workdays and a hectic lifestyle. Balancing work and personal life can be challenging, especially if you're working in a competitive industry like finance or media.\n   - **Other Cities**: In slower-paced cities, work-life balance tends to be easier to achieve. You might find more time for hobbies, family, and relaxation. However, this can also mean fewer career opportunities in high-demand industries.\n\n### 10. **Food and Dining**\n   - **New York City**: NYC is a foodie paradise. There are endless options for every type of cuisine, from fine dining to street food. You can find authentic Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Indian, and more within walking distance. Food trucks and pop-up restaurants are common, and there's always something new to try.\n   - **Other Cities**: While many cities have great dining scenes, they may not match NYC's sheer variety and quality. For example, in Portland, Oregon, you can find amazing local food and artisanal products, but it won't have the same global diversity as NYC.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLiving in NYC offers unparalleled access to culture, entertainment, and diversity, but it comes with a higher cost of living and a faster pace of life. If you enjoy being in the middle of it all, surrounded by people and opportunities, NYC could be a dream come true. On the other hand, if you prefer a more laid-back lifestyle with a lower cost of living, you might find other cities like Denver, Nashville, or Portland to be a better fit.\n\nUltimately, the best place to live depends on your individual preferences, needs, and lifestyle goals.", "shortest_response": "Living in New York City (NYC) compared to other U.S. cities offers a unique experience, shaped by its dense population, diverse culture, and iconic landmarks.

Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown:\n\n### 1. **Funding:**\n   - **Public Schools:** Public schools receive most of their funding from federal, state, and local government sources. They are funded by taxpayer dollars and are required to follow state educational standards.\n   - **Private Schools:** Private schools rely on tuition fees, donations, and sometimes endowments for funding. They are not required to follow state educational standards unless they are also accredited.\n\n### 2. **Governance:**\n   - **Public Schools:** Public schools are governed by local school boards or district-level administrators. The community often has a significant voice in decision-making processes.\n   - **Private Schools:** Private schools are typically governed by a board of trustees, which may include parents, alumni, and other stakeholders. These boards have more control over the direction and policies of the school.\n\n### 3. **Curriculum:**\n   - **Public Schools:** Public schools must adhere to state educational standards and guidelines. While there is some flexibility, they are generally required to cover core subjects like math, science, English, and social studies.\n   - **Private Schools:** Private schools have more autonomy in designing their curricula. They may offer specialized programs, focus on particular philosophies (e.g., Montessori, Waldorf), or incorporate religious teachings into their curriculum.\n\n### 4. **Admissions Criteria:**\n   - **Public Schools:** Public schools are open to all students within their designated geographic area, regardless of academic performance or financial background. They do not require entrance exams or specific qualifications.\n   - **Private Schools:** Private schools often have selective admission processes. Many require entrance exams (like the SSAT or ISEE), interviews, or portfolios. Some private schools are selective based on academic performance, while others may prioritize certain demographics (e.g., religious affiliation).\n\n### 5. **Philosophy and Focus:**\n   - **Public Schools:** Public schools tend to emphasize standardized testing, accountability, and preparing students for college or career readiness as mandated by state and federal education policies.\n   - **Private Schools:** Private schools can vary widely in their educational philosophies. Some focus on academic excellence, while others prioritize character development, creativity, or faith-based education.\n\n### 6. **Class Size:**\n   - **Public Schools:** Class sizes can vary widely depending on the school district, but they are often larger due to budget constraints and the need to serve a larger student population.\n   - **Private Schools:** Class sizes are generally smaller, allowing for more individualized attention and personalized instruction.\n\n### 7. **Diversity:**\n   - **Public Schools:** Public schools are often more diverse in terms of socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity because they serve a broader geographical area and are open to all students.\n   - **Private Schools:** Private schools may have more homogeneous student bodies, especially if they are selective or have specific mission statements regarding diversity or religious affiliation.\n\n### 8. **Extracurricular Activities:**\n   - **Public Schools:** Public schools offer a wide range of extracurricular activities, including sports, music, theater, and clubs, which are often supported by government funding.\n   - **Private Schools:** Private schools may offer additional or more specialized extracurricular activities, such as debate teams, robotics clubs, or specialized sports programs, which may be supported by private funding.\n\n### 9. **Religious Affiliation:**\n   - **Public Schools:** Public schools are secular and cannot promote religion or religious practices. They must remain neutral in matters of faith.\n   - **Private Schools:** Many private schools are affiliated with religious organizations and may incorporate religious teachings into their curriculum. Religious schools may also offer religious services or observances during the school day.\n\n### 10. **Teacher Compensation:**\n   - **Public Schools:** Teachers in public schools are typically paid by the government and are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Their salaries and benefits are often determined by state and local policies.\n   - **Private Schools:** Teachers in private schools are usually employed directly by the school and may receive higher or lower compensation depending on the institution's budget and endowment.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Public Schools** are publicly funded, non-selective, and governed by local authorities. They follow state standards and are accessible to all students.\n- **Private Schools** are privately funded, often selective, and governed by a board of trustees. They have more flexibility in curriculum and philosophy but may come with higher tuition costs.\n\nChoosing between public and private schooling depends on a family\u2019s priorities, budget, and educational goals.", "shortest_response": "The primary differences between public and private schools lie in their funding, governance, curriculum, and admission policies:\n\n1. **Funding**:\n   - **Public Schools**: Funded primarily by taxpayer dollars at the federal, state, and local levels.

They are subject to regulations set by state and federal governments.\n   - **Private Schools**: Governed by a board of trustees or administrators who are not necessarily elected by the public. They have more autonomy over policies and operations.\n\n3. **Curriculum**:\n   - **Public Schools**: Must follow state-mandated curricula and adhere to national standards like Common Core (in some states). They are generally required to offer certain subjects and meet specific educational outcomes.\n   - **Private Schools**: Have more flexibility in designing their curricula. Some may focus on specialized areas such as arts, sciences, or religious studies, depending on their mission.\n\n4. **Admission Policies**:\n   - **Public Schools**: Admit students based on residency and availability. There is no tuition cost for students who live within the district's boundaries.\n   - **Private Schools**: Admission is often selective, based on factors such as academic performance, standardized test scores, interviews, essays, and extracurricular activities. Tuition costs vary widely and can be substantial.\n\n5. **Resources and Facilities**:\n   - **Public Schools**: Typically funded by the community, they may have varying levels of resources depending on the district's wealth and political priorities.\n   - **Private Schools**: Often have more consistent and higher-quality resources due to tuition funding, but this can vary depending on the school.\n\n6. **Religious Affiliation**:\n   - **Public Schools**: Generally secular and do not promote any particular religion.\n   - **Private Schools**: Many are affiliated with religious organizations, which may influence the curriculum, values, and daily life of the school.\n\n7. **Accountability**:\n   - **Public Schools**: Subject to extensive oversight and accountability measures, including standardized testing and reporting requirements.\n   - **Private Schools**: Less regulated, though many still participate in standardized testing and other accountability measures voluntarily.\n\nIn summary, public schools are publicly funded and accountable to the government, while private schools are privately funded and governed by independent boards.

They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.\n\nRadiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in 1993. Their debut single, \"Creep\", became a worldwide hit. Radiohead's popularity and critical standing rose with the release of The Bends in 1995. Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music.\n\nRadiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though Kid A divided listeners, it was later named the best album of the decade by multiple outlets. It was followed by Amnesiac (2001), recorded in the same sessions. Hail to the Thief (2003), with lyrics addressing the War on Terror, blended the band's rock and electronic sides, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI.\n\nRadiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway, and O'Brien have released solo albums; in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.\n\nBy 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart: \"Creep\" (1992), \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" (1996), \"Paranoid Android\" (1997), \"Karma Police\" (1997), \"No Surprises\" (1998), \"Pyramid Song\" (2001), and \"There There\" (2003). \"Creep\" and \"Nude\" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Rolling Stone named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and Rolling Stone readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s.

Boehm in the late 1970s. It is designed to help predict the effort, time, and cost required to develop software projects based on various input parameters. The model is particularly useful for software engineering teams looking to plan and manage their projects more effectively.\n\n### Key Aspects of COCOMO:\n\n1. **Historical Data-Based**: The parameters used in COCOMO are derived from fitting a regression formula to data from historical software projects. This includes data from 63 projects for COCOMO 81 and 163 projects for COCOMO II. This empirical approach helps in making predictions that are grounded in real-world experience.\n\n2. **Three Versions**:\n   - **COCOMO I**: The original version, which was released in 1981. It is based on a single linear equation that estimates the effort required for a project.\n   - **COCOMO II**: An improved version released in 1995. COCOMO II is more sophisticated, offering three models (Basic, Intermediate, and Detailed) that provide different levels of accuracy depending on the level of detail available about the project.\n     - **Basic Model**: Uses only one parameter (KLOC, or thousands of lines of code) to estimate effort.\n     - **Intermediate Model**: Incorporates additional factors like design complexity and software technology to refine the estimation.\n     - **Detailed Model**: Provides the most accurate estimation by considering a wide range of project-specific factors, including project size, development environment, and organizational capabilities.\n\n3. **Parameters**:\n   - **Size**: The primary factor in COCOMO is the size of the software project, typically measured in KLOC (thousands of lines of code).\n   - **Complexity**: This factor accounts for the inherent complexity of the software being developed, such as the number of new modules, new classes, and the presence of real-time requirements.\n   - **Technology**: This factor considers the maturity and ease of use of the programming language and tools being used.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - COCOMO provides estimates for several key metrics, including:\n     - **Effort**: The total amount of work required to complete the project, usually measured in person-months.\n     - **Time**: The estimated duration of the project.\n     - **Cost**: The projected cost of developing the software, often expressed in monetary terms.\n\n5. **Use Cases**:\n   - COCOMO is primarily used during the early stages of a software project to provide rough estimates of effort, time, and cost. It helps in planning and budgeting, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions about resource allocation and project timelines.\n\nWhile COCOMO is a valuable tool for software cost estimation, it is important to note that its accuracy can vary depending on the quality of the input data and the specific characteristics of the project.

It is an example of cannibalization.\nThe term alludes to the Osborne Computer Corporation, whose second product did not become available until more than a year after it was announced. The company's subsequent bankruptcy was widely blamed on reduced sales after the announcement.\nThe Osborne Effect states that prematurely discussing future, unavailable products damages sales of existing products. The name comes from the planned replacement of the Osborne 1, an early personal computer first sold by the Osborne Computer Corporation in 1981. In 1983, founder Adam Osborne pre-announced several next-generation computer models (the Osborne Executive and Osborne Vixen), which were only prototypes, highlighting the fact that they would outperform the existing model as the prototypes dramatically cut down assembly time. A widely held belief was that sales of the Osborne 1 fell sharply as customers anticipated those more advanced systems, leading to a sales decline from which Osborne Computer was unable to recover. This belief appeared in the media almost immediately after the company's September 1983 bankruptcy:\n\nTo give the jazzy $2,495 Osborne Executive a running start, Adam began orchestrating publicity early in 1983. We, along with many other magazines, were shown the machine in locked hotel rooms. We were required not to have anything in print about it until the planned release date in mid-April. As far as we know, nothing did appear in print, but dealers heard about the plans and cancelled orders for the Osborne 1 in droves. In early April, Osborne told dealers he would be showing them the machine on a one-week tour the week of 17 April, and emphasized that the new machine was not a competitor for the Osborne 1. But dealers didn't react the way Osborne expected; said Osborne, \"All of them just cancelled their orders for the Osborne 1.\"\n\nOsborne reacted by drastically cutting prices on the Osborne 1 in an effort to stimulate cash flow. But nothing seemed to work, and for several months sales were practically non-existent.\n\nPre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, with the revenue drop for the current product being offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available.

The primary intention for the Wall's construction was to prevent East German citizens from fleeing to the West.", "longest_response": "The primary reason for constructing the Berlin Wall was to prevent East German citizens from fleeing to the West. By the mid-1950s and early 1960s, there was a significant exodus of people from East Germany to West Germany, which created a severe economic and political problem for the communist government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The massive flow of refugees, particularly young, educated individuals, was draining resources and skilled labor from East Germany, while strengthening the capitalist economy in West Germany.\n\nTo address this issue, the GDR government took increasingly restrictive measures to control emigration, including closing the border between East and West Germany in 1952 and restricting travel within East Germany itself. Despite these efforts, thousands of people continued to attempt to escape to West Berlin and, from there, to West Germany. The construction of the Berlin Wall began on August 13, 1961, as a more comprehensive and effective means of preventing mass emigration.", "shortest_response": "The primary reason for constructing the Berlin Wall was to prevent East German citizens from fleeing to the West.

Jack the Black Cat, known for its closed white eyes and white whiskers, is one of the rarest Squishmallows sold to date. KellyToys introduced the limited edition stuffed animal on their website in 2020, where it sold out within two hours. Third party websites like eBay host listings for Jack the Black Cat valued at nearly $2,000. Among the many Squishmallows that are sold, some of the most popular include Connor the Cow, Malcolm the Mushroom, Archie the Axolotl, and Philippe the Frog. There are reports that resellers are harassed and doxxed by the community.", "longest_response": "A Squishmallow becomes resellable due to a combination of factors that create scarcity, desirability, and market demand. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what makes certain Squishmallows more likely to be resold:\n\n### 1. **Rarity**\n   - **Limited Editions**: Squishmallows that are part of limited series or special collections tend to be more desirable. For example, Jack the Black Cat, with its unique features (closed white eyes and white whiskers), is one of the rarest and most sought-after Squishmallows.\n   - **Uniqueness**: Squishmallows with distinctive features or designs that set them apart from the standard line are more likely to attract attention. This includes colors, patterns, or specific anatomical details.\n\n### 2. **Demand**\n   - **Popularity**: Squishmallows that are highly popular among fans tend to have higher resale value.

For instance, if a Squishmallow becomes associated with a particular trend or event, its value may increase.\n\n### 3. **Condition**\n   - **Mint Condition**: Squishmallows in pristine, unopened, or unused condition are more valuable. Resellers often prefer to sell items that appear as close to their original state as possible, as this adds to their perceived rarity and authenticity.\n   - **Minimal Wear**: Even minor signs of wear can reduce the value of a Squishmallow. Collectors and resellers tend to favor items that show minimal signs of use.\n\n### 4. **Supply and Demand Dynamics**\n   - **Short Supply**: Squishmallows that were released in limited quantities or sold out quickly (like Jack the Black Cat) tend to be harder to come by, driving up their value. If a specific Squishmallow is no longer available through official channels, it becomes even more desirable.\n   - **Release Timing**: Squishmallows that were released during peak seasons or events (e.g., holidays, special promotions) may see increased demand and higher resale prices.\n\n### 5. **Resale Platforms**\n   - **Reputation of the Platform**: Resellers often use platforms like eBay, Etsy, or specialized Squishmallow forums where there is a strong community of buyers and sellers. These platforms can enhance the visibility of a Squishmallow and make it easier to find potential buyers.\n   - **Marketplace Conditions**: The overall condition of the Squishmallow (new, gently used, etc.) will affect its resale value. A Squishmallow that has been well-cared for will generally fetch a higher price.\n\n### 6. **Community and Cultural Impact**\n   - **Collectible Status**: Squishmallows that have gained a reputation as collectibles rather than just toys are more likely to be resold. This can happen if they become associated with social media challenges, fan art, or other forms of cultural expression.\n   - **Fan Base**: Squishmallows with dedicated fan bases are more likely to command higher resale prices. Fans who want to own a particular Squishmallow may be willing to pay more to acquire it, especially if it\u2019s a limited edition or rare variant.\n\n### 7. **Ethical Considerations**\n   - **Harassment and Doxxing**: As mentioned, some resellers face harassment and doxxing from the community, which can complicate the resale process. This can sometimes drive up the price of certain Squishmallows, as collectors may be willing to pay more to avoid legal or ethical issues.\n\nIn summary, a Squishmallow's resellability is driven by a combination of rarity, popularity, condition, and the dynamics of supply and demand. Limited editions, unique designs, and strong community support all contribute to making certain Squishmallows highly desirable and valuable in the resale market.", "shortest_response": "The resellability of a Squishmallow, particularly the more popular and limited edition ones, is driven by several key factors:\n\n1. **Rarity**: Limited edition Squishmallows, such as Jack the Black Cat, are inherently rare due to their limited production runs. This scarcity significantly increases their desirability among collectors and resellers.\n\n2. **Demand**: High demand from both collectors and casual buyers drives up prices. Squishmallows that are featured in popular media, have unique designs, or are associated with limited-time events tend to see higher demand.\n\n3. **Condition**: The condition of the Squishmallow plays a crucial role in its resell value. Mint condition or near-mint items fetch higher prices compared to those that show signs of wear and tear.\n\n4. **Size**: Larger Squishmallows or those that come in premium packaging can be more desirable, leading to higher resale prices.\n\n5. **Unique Features**: Squishmallows with distinctive features, such as Jack the Black Cat's closed white eyes and white whiskers, make them stand out and increase their appeal to collectors.\n\n6. **Limited-Time Availability**: Squishmallows released during special events or holiday seasons are often highly sought after, especially if they are not available year-round.\n\n7. **Community Interest**: Squishmallows that gain attention from the community, either through social media buzz or other forms of media coverage, tend to command higher resale prices.\n\n8. **Platform and Marketing**: Platforms like eBay, where Squishmallows are listed, and the marketing strategies used by resellers can also influence the resale value. Well-promoted listings may attract more buyers, increasing the price.\n\nGiven these factors, it's no surprise that certain Squishmallows, like Jack the Black Cat, can reach astronomical resale prices, sometimes even into the thousands of dollars.

Here\u2019s a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Chlorophyll Absorption Spectrum**: Chlorophyll is responsible for capturing light energy, which is essential for photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy (glucose) that fuels their growth and development. Chlorophyll absorbs light most efficiently in the blue and red parts of the electromagnetic spectrum but reflects and transmits green light. This is why we perceive plants as green.\n\n2. **Optimal Light Utilization**: The green light that is reflected by leaves does not contribute significantly to photosynthesis because it is less efficiently absorbed by chlorophyll. By reflecting green light, plants effectively reduce competition for light from other plants in their environment. This is particularly important in dense vegetation where plants compete for sunlight.\n\n3. **Evolutionary Advantage**: Over millions of years, plants have evolved to maximize their ability to capture light energy for photosynthesis. Reflecting green light allows them to optimize their use of available light while minimizing energy loss through unnecessary absorption of less effective wavelengths.\n\n4. **Other Pigments**: While chlorophyll is the primary pigment involved in photosynthesis, some plants also contain other pigments like carotenoids (which can appear yellow or orange) and anthocyanins (which can appear red). These pigments can affect the overall color of the plant, but they do not play a direct role in light absorption for photosynthesis. For example, some red-leaved plants still contain chlorophyll and are green when viewed from a distance.\n\nIn summary, the green color of plants is a result of chlorophyll's efficient absorption of blue and red light, with green light being reflected rather than absorbed, allowing plants to maximize their light-capturing efficiency and gain an evolutionary advantage in their environment.", "shortest_response": "Plants appear green because of the pigment chlorophyll, which is essential for photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy to fuel their growth and development.\n\nChlorophyll absorbs light most efficiently in the blue and red parts of the electromagnetic spectrum but reflects and transmits light in the green part. This is why we perceive plants as green. The chlorophyll molecules capture sunlight, primarily in the blue and red wavelengths, and use it to drive the reactions that produce energy-rich molecules like glucose, while reflecting or transmitting the green light back into our eyes.\n\nIn summary, the green color of plants is a result of the chlorophyll pigment's ability to absorb light for photosynthesis while reflecting green light, which is why we see plants as green.", "input_size": 25, "output_sizes": [256, 157, 193, 290, 262, 305, 391, 327, 299, 183], "output_mean": 266.3, "output_std": 68.37, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 208.75, "p50": 276.0, "p75": 303.5, "p99": 385.24}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 7.8404}, {"sample_id": "d3e1daaf98b33502", "prompt_id": "f73169ecd047b2b2", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "How reliable is public transportation?", "longest_response": "The reliability of public transportation can vary significantly depending on several factors, including the specific region, the type of service (e.g., buses, trains, subways), and the time of day or week. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how reliability can differ:\n\n### 1. **Urban vs. Rural Areas**\n   - **Urban Areas**: In densely populated cities, public transportation systems like buses, trains, and subways are often more reliable because they serve large populations with predictable travel patterns. However, during peak hours, congestion and delays can still occur.\n   - **Rural Areas**: Public transportation in rural areas is often less frequent and may rely more on scheduled services that can be affected by weather conditions or low ridership.\n\n### 2. **Mode of Transportation**\n   - **Buses**: Buses can be more flexible and adaptable to changing conditions, but they are also more susceptible to traffic delays and unpredictable events (e.g., road closures).\n   - **Trains**: Train schedules are generally more rigid, but they tend to have fewer delays due to traffic compared to buses. However, train services can be disrupted by track maintenance, accidents, or weather events.\n   - **Subways/metros**: Subways and metro systems are typically more reliable because they operate underground or in dedicated lanes, reducing the impact of surface-level issues like traffic. However, they can still experience disruptions due to technical failures or maintenance.\n\n### 3. **Time of Day**\n   - **Peak Hours**: During rush hour, public transportation can become crowded, leading to longer wait times and potential delays. This is especially true for bus and train systems in large cities.\n   - **Off-Peak Hours**: Services during off-peak hours may be less frequent, and there may be fewer passengers, which can lead to more flexibility but also longer wait times between trips.\n\n### 4. **Weather Conditions**\n   - **Good Weather**: Public transportation tends to run smoothly during clear weather conditions.\n   - **Bad Weather**: Extreme weather events such as heavy rain, snowstorms, or heatwaves can cause significant disruptions. For example, buses may get stuck in traffic, trains may be delayed due to slippery tracks, or subways may experience flooding.\n\n### 5. **Infrastructure and Maintenance**\n   - **Well-Maintained Systems**: Systems that receive regular maintenance and updates tend to be more reliable. For example, modern subway systems with advanced signaling technology are generally more dependable than older systems.\n   - **Underfunded Systems**: In regions where public transportation infrastructure is underfunded or neglected, reliability can suffer due to outdated equipment, poor maintenance, and overcrowding.\n\n### 6. **Crowding**\n   - **Overcrowded Vehicles**: When vehicles are too full, it can slow down travel times and increase discomfort for passengers. Overcrowding is more common during peak hours and in densely populated areas.\n\n### 7. **Service Frequency**\n   - **Frequent Services**: Systems with more frequent service (e.g., every 10 minutes) tend to be more reliable because there is less chance of long wait times between trips.\n   - **Less Frequent Services**: Systems with less frequent service (e.g., hourly or less) may have longer wait times, making them less reliable for time-sensitive travel.\n\n### 8. **Public Policies and Funding**\n   - **Well-Funded Systems**: Public transportation systems that receive adequate funding from governments tend to be more reliable. They can invest in better infrastructure, technology, and maintenance.\n   - **Underfunded Systems**: Lack of funding can lead to delays, overcrowding, and a lack of modern amenities, affecting overall reliability.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn general, public transportation can be quite reliable in well-maintained urban systems, especially during off-peak hours and good weather conditions. However, reliability can decrease during peak hours, bad weather, or when systems are underfunded. To improve reliability, many cities are investing in modernization, expanding services, and improving infrastructure.\n\nIf you're planning to use public transportation, checking real-time schedules, weather forecasts, and local transit authority announcements can help you anticipate potential delays or changes.", "shortest_response": "The reliability of public transportation can vary significantly depending on the region, the type of service, and the specific operator. Here are some key factors that influence its reliability:\n\n1. **Region**: Public transportation systems in urban areas with well-planned infrastructure tend to be more reliable than those in rural or less developed regions.\n\n2. **Type of Service**:\n   - **Buses**: Can be highly variable, depending on road conditions, traffic, and maintenance.\n   - **Trains**: Generally more reliable due to fixed routes and fewer stops compared to buses.\n   - **Subways/Metros**: Often have high reliability because they operate in dedicated tracks and are less affected by surface conditions like weather or traffic.\n\n3. **Operator**: Different transit agencies have different levels of efficiency and reliability.

To understand why, consider the function:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = x^2 - N\n   \\]\n   The root of this function is \\( \\sqrt{N} \\).\n\n4. **Fixed Point**: The method can be interpreted as finding a fixed point of the function \\( g(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( x + \\frac{N}{x} \\right) \\). A fixed point \\( x^* \\) satisfies:\n   \\[\n   x^* = g(x^*)\n   \\]\n   Solving this equation gives:\n   \\[\n   x^* = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( x^* + \\frac{N}{x^*} \\right)\n   \\]\n   Multiplying both sides by \\( 2x^* \\):\n   \\[\n   2x^{*2} = x^{*2} + N\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   x^{*2} = N \\implies x^* = \\sqrt{N}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Monotonic Convergence**: For a positive initial guess \\( x_0 > 0 \\), the sequence \\( \\{ x_k \\} \\) is monotonically decreasing if \\( x_0 > \\sqrt{N} \\) and monotonically increasing if \\( x_0 < \\sqrt{N} \\), and it converges to \\( \\sqrt{N} \\).\n\n6. **Quadratic Convergence**: If the initial guess is sufficiently close to the true value, the convergence is quadratic, meaning the error decreases very rapidly with each iteration.\n\n### Example:\n\nLet's compute the square root of 2 starting with an initial guess \\( x_0 = 1 \\):\n\n1. \\( x_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{2}{1} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 = 1.5 \\)\n2. \\( x_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1.5 + \\frac{2}{1.5} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1.5 + 1.3333 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2.8333 = 1.4167 \\)\n3. \\( x_3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1.4167 + \\frac{2}{1.4167} \\right) \\approx 1.4142 \\)\n\nAs you can see, the approximations quickly converge to the actual value of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.4142 \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe divide and average method works because it effectively finds a fixed point of a function related to the square root problem, and it converges quadratically to the correct solution under appropriate conditions.", "shortest_response": "The divide and average (or Babylonian) method, also known as the Newton-Raphson method for finding square roots, is an iterative algorithm that works because it applies the principles of linear approximation and fixed-point iteration to converge on the square root of a number. Here's why it works:\n\n1. **Linear Approximation**: The method starts with an initial guess \\( x_0 \\) for the square root of a number \\( N \\). It then refines this guess using the formula:\n   \\[\n   x_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( x_n + \\frac{N}{x_n} \\right)\n   \\]\n   This formula can be derived from the Newton-Raphson method applied to the function \\( f(x) = x^2 - N \\), where the derivative \\( f'(x) = 2x \\).\n\n2. **Fixed-Point Iteration**: The iteration process is designed to converge to a fixed point, which is the actual square root of \\( N \\). A fixed point \\( x \\) satisfies the equation \\( x = g(x) \\), where \\( g(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( x + \\frac{N}{x} \\right) \\). Solving \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( x + \\frac{N}{x} \\right) \\) gives \\( x^2 = N \\), confirming that the fixed point is indeed the square root of \\( N \\).\n\n3. **Convergence**: The method converges quadratically if the initial guess is sufficiently close to the true square root. This means that the error in the estimate decreases very rapidly with each iteration. The rate of convergence is due to the quadratic nature of the function being approximated.\n\n4. **Intuitive Reasoning**: Intuitively, the method works by averaging the current guess with the result of dividing \\( N \\) by the current guess. This averaging process tends to pull the guess closer to the true square root, especially as the iterations progress.\n\nIn summary, the divide and average method works because it uses a combination of linear approximation and fixed-point iteration to iteratively refine an initial guess until it converges to the square root of the given number.", "input_size": 32, "output_sizes": [683, 468, 700, 603, 824, 586, 817, 759, 532, 624], "output_mean": 659.6, "output_std": 112.58, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 590.25, "p50": 653.5, "p75": 744.25, "p99": 823.37}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 17.85372}, {"sample_id": "9a7f8a3ccd23146e", "prompt_id": "3c03855fd21f1cec", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What are 6 different reasons to go on vacation?", "longest_response": "Here are six different reasons why someone might go on vacation:\n\n1. **Relaxation and Stress Relief**: Vacations provide an opportunity to unwind from daily stressors, whether it's work, family responsibilities, or personal challenges.

Process mining provides novel insights that can be used to identify the executional path taken by operational processes and address their performance and compliance problems.\n\nProcess mining starts from event data. Input for process mining is an event log. An event log views a process from a particular angle. Each event in the log should contain (1) a unique identifier for a particular process instance (called case id), (2) an activity (description of the event that is occurring), and (3) a timestamp. There may be additional event attributes referring to resources, costs, etc., but these are optional. With some effort, such data can be extracted from any information system supporting operational processes. Process mining uses these event data to answer a variety of process-related questions.", "longest_response": "Process mining is a powerful set of techniques that bridges the gap between data science and process management. It enables organizations to analyze operational processes using event data, which is typically generated by information systems during the execution of business processes. The primary goal of process mining is to transform this raw event data into actionable insights, helping organizations optimize their processes, improve performance, and ensure compliance.\n\n### Key Concepts of Process Mining:\n\n1. **Event Data**: \n   - Process mining relies on event data, which captures the sequence of activities performed in the execution of a process.\n   - An event log is the structured representation of this event data. Each event in the log contains:\n     - **Case ID**: A unique identifier for each process instance.\n     - **Activity**: A description of the event or activity that occurred.\n     - **Timestamp**: The time at which the event took place.\n   - Additional attributes like resource identifiers, costs, etc., can also be included, though they are optional.\n\n2. **Event Logs**:\n   - Event logs provide a detailed view of how processes unfold over time. They capture the sequence of activities and their timing, offering a rich source of information about process execution.\n   - These logs can be extracted from various information systems, including ERP systems, CRM systems, and other operational databases.\n\n3. **Process Discovery**:\n   - One of the main tasks in process mining is process discovery, which involves automatically inferring a process model from the event data.\n   - Techniques like Inductive Process Discovery (IPD) are used to generate a process model that accurately represents the actual behavior observed in the event log.\n\n4. **Conformance Checking**:\n   - This technique compares the actual process execution (captured in the event log) with a reference process model (such as a BPMN diagram).\n   - Conformance checking helps identify deviations or anomalies in the process execution, highlighting areas where the process does not follow the intended design.\n\n5. **Performance Analysis**:\n   - Process mining can analyze the performance of processes by examining metrics such as cycle time, throughput, and resource utilization.\n   - Insights gained from performance analysis can help identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the process.\n\n6. **Process Improvement**:\n   - Armed with insights from process mining, organizations can take targeted actions to improve their processes. This could involve re-designing workflows, optimizing resource allocation, or implementing new policies.\n\n7. **Compliance Monitoring**:\n   - Process mining can also be used to monitor compliance with regulations or organizational standards. By comparing the actual process execution with predefined rules, it can flag instances of non-compliance.\n\n### Applications of Process Mining:\n\n- **Operational Efficiency**: Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in business processes.\n- **Quality Improvement**: Ensure that processes are executed correctly and consistently.\n- **Risk Management**: Detect patterns that could indicate potential risks or fraud.\n- **Regulatory Compliance**: Monitor adherence to legal and organizational standards.\n- **Customer Service Optimization**: Improve service delivery by analyzing customer interaction processes.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nProcess mining is a valuable tool for organizations looking to gain deeper insights into their operational processes. By leveraging event data and applying advanced analytics techniques, process mining helps organizations optimize processes, improve performance, and ensure compliance. As more organizations adopt digital transformation strategies, the importance of process mining will continue to grow, enabling them to make data-driven decisions that drive competitive advantage.", "shortest_response": "Process mining is a discipline that bridges the gap between data science and process management.

The challenge lies in ensuring that the data is structured and complete enough to be analyzed effectively.\n\n3. **Process Discovery**: One of the main goals of process mining is to discover the actual process flow based on the event data. This involves reconstructing the sequence of activities that were executed, identifying deviations from expected paths, and uncovering inefficiencies or bottlenecks.\n\n4. **Process Conformance Checking**: Another key aspect of process mining is checking how well the observed process instances conform to the formally defined process model. This helps in identifying discrepancies between the intended process design and the actual execution.\n\n5. **Performance Analysis**: Process mining can also provide insights into the performance of processes, helping organizations understand how efficiently tasks are being completed and where improvements can be made.\n\n6. **Compliance Monitoring**: By analyzing event logs, process mining can help ensure that processes comply with regulatory requirements and organizational policies.\n\n### Applications of Process Mining\n\n- **Improving Efficiency**: By identifying inefficiencies and bottlenecks, organizations can optimize their processes to reduce cycle times and costs.\n- **Enhancing Compliance**: Ensuring that processes adhere to legal and organizational standards can mitigate risks associated with non-compliance.\n- **Customer Service Optimization**: In industries like retail and telecommunications, process mining can help streamline customer service operations, leading to better customer satisfaction.\n- **Operational Excellence**: Continuous monitoring and improvement of processes contribute to overall operational excellence.\n\nIn summary, process mining is a powerful tool that leverages data from event logs to provide actionable insights into operational processes.

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you evaluate your marketing performance:\n\n### 1. **Set Clear Objectives**\n   - Define specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for your marketing efforts.\n   - Align these objectives with broader business goals.\n\n### 2. **Track Key Metrics**\n   Identify and track key performance indicators (KPIs) that align with your objectives. Common metrics include:\n   - **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of visitors who take a desired action (e.g., purchase, sign up).\n   - **Cost per Acquisition (CPA)**: Total marketing spend divided by the number of conversions.\n   - **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**: Revenue generated from marketing activities divided by the cost of those activities.\n   - **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: Total marketing costs divided by the number of new customers acquired.\n   - **Website Traffic**: Number of visitors to your website.\n   - **Engagement Metrics**: Likes, shares, comments, etc., for social media or email campaigns.\n   - **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Average revenue attributed to a single customer over their lifetime.\n\n### 3. **Segment Your Data**\n   Analyze data by different segments such as:\n   - **Geography**: Regional performance differences.\n   - **Demographics**: Age, gender, income, etc.\n   - **Device**: Mobile vs. desktop performance.\n   - **Channel**: Social media, email, paid ads, organic traffic, etc.\n\n### 4. **Use Attribution Models**\n   Implement an attribution model to understand which channels and touchpoints contribute to conversions. Common models include:\n   - **Last Click Attribution**: Credits the entire conversion to the last channel the user interacted with before converting.\n   - **First Click Attribution**: Credits the first interaction with the channel.\n   - **Linear Attribution**: Distributes credit equally across all touchpoints.\n   - **Time Decay Attribution**: Gives more weight to recent interactions.\n\n### 5. **Analyze Trends Over Time**\n   Look at historical data to identify trends and patterns. Use tools like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or other analytics platforms to visualize and analyze data over time. This will help you spot seasonality, changes in consumer behavior, or shifts in market conditions.\n\n### 6. **Compare Performance Across Channels**\n   Evaluate the performance of each marketing channel relative to others. Determine which channels are driving the most value and which ones are underperforming.

While it's important to focus on sustainable habits for long-term health, it's also crucial to approach weight loss in a safe and balanced way. Here are some strategies to help you lose weight faster, but always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new diet or exercise program:\n\n### 1. **Caloric Deficit**\n   - **Eat fewer calories than you burn**: To lose weight, you need to create a caloric deficit. This means burning more calories than you consume.\n     - **Calculate your daily calorie needs**: Use an online calculator or consult a nutritionist to determine how many calories you need to maintain your current weight. Then, aim to consume about 500-700 calories less per day to lose 1-2 pounds per week.\n     - **Monitor portion sizes**: Be mindful of the amount of food you eat, especially high-calorie foods like sugary snacks, fried foods, and processed meals.\n\n### 2. **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)**\n   - **Short bursts of intense exercise**: HIIT is a type of workout that alternates between short periods of high-intensity activity and low-intensity recovery. It burns calories efficiently and increases metabolism.\n     - Examples: Sprinting, jump rope, burpees, or any form of cardio followed by rest or lower-intensity movements.\n     - Aim for 20-30 minutes of HIIT sessions 3-4 times a week.\n\n### 3. **Strength Training**\n   - **Build muscle**: Muscle weighs more than fat, but it burns more calories at rest. Incorporating strength training into your routine can help increase your metabolic rate, leading to faster weight loss.\n     - Focus on compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, lunges, bench presses, and pull-ups.\n     - Aim for 2-3 strength training sessions per week, with at least one day of rest in between.\n\n### 4. **Increase Your Activity Level**\n   - **Move more throughout the day**: Even small increases in physical activity can make a difference. Park further away from buildings, take the stairs instead of the elevator, or go for a walk during breaks.\n   - **Active hobbies**: Engage in activities you enjoy, such as dancing, hiking, or playing sports, which can keep you motivated and help you burn more calories.\n\n### 5. **Hydrate Properly**\n   - **Drink plenty of water**: Staying hydrated helps regulate metabolism and suppress appetite. Aim for at least 8-10 glasses of water per day.\n   - **Avoid sugary drinks**: Limit or eliminate sugary sodas, juices, and sweetened coffee or tea, as they can add unnecessary calories.\n\n### 6. **Healthy Eating Habits**\n   - **Focus on whole foods**: Prioritize nutrient-dense foods like vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats.\n   - **Limit processed foods**: Processed foods are often high in calories, unhealthy fats, sugars, and sodium. Try to minimize them in your diet.\n   - **Mindful eating**: Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues, and avoid emotional eating. Eat slowly and savor your food.\n\n### 7. **Get Enough Sleep**\n   - **Sleep quality and duration**: Poor sleep can disrupt hormones that control hunger and appetite, leading to overeating. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.\n   - **Consistent bedtime routine**: Establish a relaxing bedtime routine to improve sleep quality.\n\n### 8. **Consider Supplements (with Caution)**\n   - **Consult a doctor**: Some supplements like caffeine, green tea extract, or branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) may help boost metabolism or aid in weight loss. However, they should not replace a balanced diet and exercise.\n   - **Be cautious**: Not all supplements are safe, and some may have side effects. Always check with a healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen.\n\n### 9. **Stay Consistent and Patient**\n   - **Long-term mindset**: Rapid weight loss is often unsustainable and can lead to yo-yo dieting. Focus on making sustainable lifestyle changes rather than quick fixes.\n   - **Track progress**: Keep a journal or use a fitness app to track your meals, workouts, and progress. This can help you stay motivated and identify areas for improvement.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- **Consult a Healthcare Professional**: Before making significant changes to your diet or exercise routine, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are pregnant/breastfeeding.\n- **Listen to Your Body**: If you feel overly tired, dizzy, or experience other symptoms, it might be a sign that you're pushing yourself too hard. Adjust your plan accordingly.\n\nRemember, losing weight too quickly can sometimes lead to muscle loss, dehydration, or nutrient deficiencies. The key is to focus on sustainable habits that promote overall health and well-being.", "shortest_response": "Losing weight quickly can be challenging and often involves making significant changes to your diet, exercise routine, and lifestyle. While it's important to focus on sustainable habits, it's also crucial to prioritize health and safety. Here are some strategies you can consider:\n\n### 1. **Eat a Balanced Diet**\n   - **Focus on Whole Foods:** Prioritize nutrient-dense foods like vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats.\n   - **Control Portion Sizes:** Even healthy foods can contribute to weight gain if consumed in excess.\n   - **Hydrate:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Sometimes thirst is mistaken for hunger.\n   - **Limit Processed Foods:** Reduce intake of sugary snacks, refined carbohydrates, and unhealthy fats.\n\n### 2. **Increase Physical Activity**\n   - **Cardiovascular Exercise:** Activities like running, cycling, swimming, or brisk walking can help burn calories.\n   - **Strength Training:** Building muscle through resistance training can boost metabolism and help burn fat more efficiently.\n   - **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT):** Short bursts of intense exercise followed by rest periods can be very effective for burning calories.\n\n### 3. **Create a Calorie Deficit**\n   - To lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you consume. Aim for a deficit of around 500-750 calories per day, which can lead to a weekly weight loss of about 1-2 pounds.\n   - You can achieve this by either reducing your calorie intake, increasing your physical activity, or a combination of both.\n\n### 4. **Get Enough Sleep**\n   - Lack of sleep can disrupt hormones that regulate appetite and metabolism, leading to overeating and weight gain. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.\n\n### 5. **Manage Stress**\n   - High stress levels can lead to emotional eating and weight gain.

As the largest optical telescope in space, it is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars, the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.\n\nThe U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led JWST's design and development and partnered with two main agencies: the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Maryland managed telescope development, while the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore on the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University currently operates JWST. The primary contractor for the project was Northrop Grumman. The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana, and arrived at the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point in January 2022. The first JWST image was released to the public via a press conference on 11 July 2022.\n\nJWST's primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated beryllium, which combined create a 6.5-meter-diameter (21 ft) mirror, compared with Hubble's 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). This gives JWST a light-collecting area of about 25 square meters, about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet and visible (0.1 to 0.8 \u03bcm), and near infrared (0.8\u20132.5 \u03bcm) spectra, JWST observes a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light (red) through mid-infrared (0.6\u201328.3 \u03bcm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below 50 K (\u2212223 \u00b0C; \u2212370 \u00b0F), such that the infrared light emitted by the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. It is deployed in a solar orbit near the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point, about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 mi) from Earth, where its five-layer sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\n\nInitial designs for the telescope, then named the Next Generation Space Telescope, began in 1996. Two concept studies were commissioned in 1999, for a potential launch in 2007 and a US$1 billion budget. The program was plagued with enormous cost overruns and delays; a major redesign in 2005 led to the current approach, with construction completed in 2016 at a total cost of US$10 billion. The high-stakes nature of the launch and the telescope's complexity were remarked upon by the media, scientists, and engineers.", "longest_response": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a state-of-the-art infrared observatory launched by NASA in collaboration with the European and Canadian space agencies. As the most powerful space telescope ever built, it features a 6.5-meter primary mirror composed of 18 hexagonal segments made of gold-coated beryllium, providing a significantly larger light-collecting area than the Hubble Space Telescope. Unlike Hubble, which focuses on visible and near-infrared light, JWST extends into mid-infrared wavelengths, allowing it to observe some of the earliest and most distant objects in the universe.\n\nDeployed at the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrange point, approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, JWST is shielded from heat and light by a five-layer sunshield, maintaining its instruments at extremely low temperatures. This setup ensures that the telescope can detect faint infrared signals without interference from its own thermal emissions. The primary mission of JWST includes studying the first stars and galaxies, observing the formation of planetary systems, and characterizing the atmospheres of exoplanets, particularly those that might support life.\n\nDevelopment of the telescope began in 1996, with initial estimates for a 2007 launch and a $1 billion budget. However, the project faced significant cost overruns and delays, ultimately costing around $10 billion and being delayed until its launch on December 25, 2021. The first images were released to the public in July 2022, marking a new era in astronomical exploration.

Despite these challenges, it successfully reached the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrange point in early 2022, where it is protected from the Sun's heat by a five-layer sunshield.

Revenue and expense should be kept separate from personal expenses.\nGoing Concern: assumes that the business will be in operation indefinitely. This validates the methods of asset capitalization, depreciation, and amortization. Only when liquidation is certain this assumption is not applicable. The business will continue to exist in the unforeseeable future.\nMonetary Unit principle: assumes a stable currency is going to be the unit of record. The FASB accepts the nominal value of the US Dollar as the monetary unit of record unadjusted for inflation.\nTime-period principle: implies that the economic activities of an enterprise can be divided into artificial time periods.\nPrinciples\nHistorical cost principle: requires companies to account and report assets and liabilities acquisition costs rather than fair market value. This principle provides information that is reliable (removing opportunity to provide subjective and potentially biased market values), but not very relevant. Thus there is a trend to use fair values. Most debts and securities are now reported at market values.\nRevenue recognition principle: holds that companies should record revenue when earned but not when received. The flow of cash does not have any bearing on the recognition of revenue. This is the essence of accrual basis accounting. Conversely, however, losses must be recognized when their occurrence becomes probable, whether or not it has actually occurred. This comports with the constraint of conservatism, yet brings it into conflict with the constraint of consistency, in that reflecting revenues/gains is inconsistent with the way in which losses are reflected.\nMatching principle: expenses have to be matched with revenues as long as it is reasonable to do so. Expenses are recognized not when the work is performed, or when a product is produced, but when the work or the product actually makes its contribution to revenue. Only if no connection with revenue can be established, cost may be charged as expenses to the current period (e.g., office salaries and other administrative expenses). This principle allows greater evaluation of actual profitability and performance (shows how much was spent to earn revenue). Depreciation and Cost of Goods Sold are good examples of application of this principle.\nFull disclosure principle: Amount and kinds of information disclosed should be decided based on trade-off analysis as a larger amount of information costs more to prepare and use. Information disclosed should be enough to make a judgment while keeping costs reasonable. Information is presented in the main body of financial statements, in the notes or as supplementary information\nConstraints\nObjectivity principle: The company financial statements provided by the accountants should be based on objective evidence.\nMateriality principle: The significance of an item should be considered when it is reported. An item is considered significant when it would affect the decision of a reasonable individual.\nConsistency principle: The company uses the same accounting principles and methods from period to period.\nConservatism principle: When choosing between two solutions, the one which has the less favorable outcome is the solution which should be chosen (see convention of conservatism)\nCost Constraint: The benefits of reporting financial information should justify and be greater than the costs imposed on supplying it.", "longest_response": "The four basic principles of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are essential for ensuring the reliability, relevance, and consistency of financial reporting. Here's a summary of these principles:\n\n1. **Historical Cost Principle**: This principle requires that assets and liabilities be recorded at their original acquisition costs rather than their current market values. While this provides reliable data, it may not always reflect the current value of assets. The principle emphasizes objectivity and consistency, but there is a growing trend towards using fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities.\n\n2. **Revenue Recognition Principle**: Revenue should be recognized when it is earned, not necessarily when it is received. This aligns with the accrual basis of accounting, where revenues are recorded in the period they are earned, regardless of when cash is received. Conversely, losses should be recognized when their occurrence is probable, even if they have not yet happened. This principle helps maintain consistency but can sometimes conflict with the principle of conservatism, which prefers to err on the side of caution.\n\n3. **Matching Principle**: This principle requires that expenses be matched with the revenues they help generate. Expenses are recognized in the period in which they contribute to revenue generation, rather than when they are incurred. This helps in accurately assessing the profitability and performance of a company by showing the true cost of generating revenue. Examples include depreciation and the cost of goods sold.\n\n4. **Full Disclosure Principle**: This principle mandates that all relevant information necessary for users to understand the financial statements should be disclosed. The amount of information disclosed is a balance between providing sufficient detail for informed decisions and minimizing the costs associated with preparing and using that information. Information is typically presented in the main body of financial statements, in the notes, or as supplementary information.\n\nThese principles, along with the four basic constraints\u2014objectivity, materiality, consistency, and conservatism\u2014are foundational to ensuring that financial statements are accurate, transparent, and useful for stakeholders.", "shortest_response": "### Four Basic Principles of GAAP Accounting\n\n1. **Historical Cost Principle**: \n   - Assets and liabilities should be recorded at their original acquisition costs, not their current market values.

This aligns with the accrual basis of accounting, where the focus is on matching revenues with the expenses incurred to generate those revenues. Losses are recognized when they become probable, not necessarily when they occur, to adhere to the conservatism principle.\n\n3. **Matching Principle**: \n   - Expenses should be matched with the revenues they help generate. This means recognizing expenses not just when they are incurred but when they contribute to generating revenue. This principle enhances the accuracy of profitability and performance measurement, exemplified by depreciation and Cost of Goods Sold.\n\n4. **Full Disclosure Principle**: \n   - Companies must disclose sufficient information to ensure users can make informed judgments, balancing the need for transparency against the costs of providing extensive data.

This alternation continued until new cups were introduced in 1919, following an initial period during which the original design by Daniel Maclise was reused.\n\n3. **Design Changes**: The first new design for the Swiney Prize cup was created by Melvin Oliver in 1919. This change marked the beginning of a new tradition for the award's presentation.\n\n4. **George Swiney's Background**: George Swiney was born in 1793 and was the son of Admiral William Swiney. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University, graduating with an M.D. in 1816. After retiring from medical practice, he settled in London, where he led a somewhat reclusive life and gained a reputation as an eccentric. His extensive work on his will eventually led to the establishment of the Swiney Prize.\n\n5. **Legacy**: The Swiney Prize has been awarded intermittently since its inception, recognizing significant contributions to the fields of medical and general jurisprudence. It remains an important honor in the realm of legal scholarship and medical ethics.\n\nIn summary, the Swiney Prize is a testament to George Swiney's legacy and his interest in the intersection of medicine and law, continuing to honor outstanding scholarly work in these areas every five years.", "shortest_response": "The Swiney Prize is a prestigious British award established by the will of George Swiney, an English physician who passed away in 1844.

There is no single, universally accepted answer, as different individuals, cultures, and belief systems offer diverse interpretations. Here are a few ways in which this question can be approached:\n\n### 1. **Religious Perspectives:**\n   - Many religious traditions provide specific answers to the question of life's purpose. For example:\n     - **Christianity** often emphasizes loving God, spreading His message, and seeking salvation.\n     - **Islam** focuses on submitting to Allah\u2019s will, living a righteous life, and striving for paradise.\n     - **Judaism** centers on following God's commandments and living a life of holiness and justice.\n     - **Hinduism** may suggest that the purpose of life is to achieve moksha (liberation) through dharma (righteous living), karma (action and consequence), and samsara (reincarnation).\n     - **Buddhism** teaches that the purpose is to overcome suffering by attaining enlightenment and achieving Nirvana.\n\n### 2. **Philosophical Perspectives:**\n   - **Existentialism** suggests that life has no inherent meaning, and it is up to each individual to create their own purpose through choices and actions.\n   - **Utilitarianism** might argue that the purpose of life is to maximize happiness and minimize suffering for the greatest number of people.\n   - **Nihilism** posits that life has no intrinsic meaning or value, and thus any purpose we assign to it is a human construct.\n   - **Absurdism** (as articulated by Albert Camus) views life as inherently absurd, but finds meaning in embracing this absurdity and living with passion despite it.\n\n### 3. **Scientific Perspectives:**\n   - From a purely biological standpoint, the purpose of life could be seen as survival and reproduction. Organisms are driven by genetic imperatives to ensure the continuation of their species.\n   - However, many scientists and thinkers have extended this idea to include the development of consciousness, creativity, and exploration as meaningful aspects of life.\n\n### 4. **Personal and Subjective Perspectives:**\n   - Many people find purpose in relationships, personal growth, contributing to society, pursuing passions, or simply experiencing joy and contentment.\n   - Some may find meaning in helping others, leaving a positive legacy, or making the world a better place.\n   - Others may view life as a journey of self-discovery, learning, and adapting to challenges.\n\n### 5. **Interfaith and Universal Perspectives:**\n   - Some believe that life\u2019s purpose is to cultivate love, compassion, and understanding, not just for oneself but for all beings. This perspective aligns with ethical and spiritual teachings across many traditions.\n   - The idea of interconnectedness\u2014whether through scientific discoveries about quantum physics or spiritual beliefs about unity\u2014suggests that life may have a deeper, collective purpose beyond individual experiences.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUltimately, the purpose of life is a deeply personal and subjective question. It may vary from person to person, culture to culture, and even within an individual over time. Some find meaning in faith, others in work, relationships, or personal fulfillment.

The characters \u65e5\u672c mean \"sun origin\", which is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\". The name \"Japan\" is based on Chinese pronunciations of \u65e5\u672c and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters \u65e5\u672c\u570b as Cipangu. The old Malay name for Japan, Japang or Japun, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century. The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as Giapan in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.", "longest_response": "The name \"Japan\" has an interesting etymological history that traces back to various linguistic influences from different regions. Here's a breakdown of how it came about:\n\n1. **Origin in China**: Before the adoption of the current Japanese name (Nippon or Nihon), Japan was known in China as **Wa** (\u502d). This term was used to refer to Japan and other East Asian countries, but it had negative connotations and was not flattering. Around the year 757 AD, Japan officially changed this name to **Wa** to **Wa** (\u548c), which means \"harmony\" or \"peace,\" reflecting a more positive and self-reflective identity.\n\n2. **Japanese Endonyms**: Prior to adopting the name \"Nippon\" or \"Nihon,\" the Japanese referred to their country by the **endonym Yamato** (\u5927\u548c), which is still used today in certain contexts, especially when referring to ancient Japanese culture or mythology.\n\n3. **Sino-Japanese Pronunciation**: The current names Nippon (\u65e5\u4ed8) and Nihon (\u65e5\u672c) are derived from the **Sino-Japanese** (or Kanbun) readings of the characters \u65e5\u672c, meaning \"sun origin.\" These names reflect the influence of Chinese language and culture on Japan, particularly during the Heian period (794\u20131185 AD). The term \"sun origin\" comes from the idea that Japan is the land where the sun rises, hence the nickname \"Land of the Rising Sun.\"\n\n4. **European Influence**: The name \"Japan\" as used in English and many other European languages has its roots in early contact with China and later with Japan itself. The earliest known use of the name \"Japan\" in a European language can be traced to the **13th-century Venetian explorer Marco Polo**, who wrote about the region he called \"Cipango\" (a corruption of the Chinese pronunciation of \u65e5\u672c\u570b, which means \"the country of the rising sun\"). \n\n5. **Southeast Asian Influence**: The name \"Japang\" or \"Japun\" used in early Portuguese texts likely originated from the **Malay or Javanese language**, which borrowed the name from a **southern Chinese dialect**. Portuguese traders encountered this name in Southeast Asia and brought it to Europe, where it evolved into \"Japan.\"\n\n6. **Early English Usage**: The first recorded version of the name \"Japan\" in English appeared in a book published in 1577, which transliterated the Portuguese spelling \"Giapan\" from a 1565 letter. Over time, the spelling evolved to \"Japan\" in English.\n\nIn summary, the name \"Japan\" is a blend of historical influences from China, Japan itself, and early European explorers, each contributing to the name we use today.", "shortest_response": "The country of Japan gets its name from the Sino-Japanese readings of the kanji characters \u65e5\u672c (Nippon or Nihon), which together mean \"sun origin.\" This etymology is derived from the characters' meanings:\n\n- \u65e5 (Ni/Hi) means \"sun.\"\n- \u672c (Hon/Pu) can be interpreted as \"origin\" or \"source.\"\n\nThus, \u65e5\u672c (Nippon/Nihon) literally translates to \"source of the sun,\" which aligns with the idea that Japan is the place where the sun rises. This concept is reflected in the Western nickname \"Land of the Rising Sun.\"\n\nThe use of these characters dates back to the early 8th century when they were officially adopted. Prior to this, Japan was known as Wa in China and as Yamato within Japan itself. The names Wa and Yamato had different origins and connotations but were not based on the sun-related meaning of \u65e5\u672c.\n\nThe name \"Japan\" in European languages has its roots in various Chinese pronunciations of \u65e5\u672c that were adopted over time. For instance:\n\n- The old Malay name \"Japang\" or \"Japun\" came from a southern Chinese dialect.\n- The name \"Cipangu\" was recorded by Marco Polo, who used a Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation.\n- The Portuguese traders encountered \"Japang\" or \"Japun\" in Southeast Asia and brought it to Europe.\n\nThe first appearance of the name \"Japan\" in English comes from a 1577 book, which translated a 1565 Portuguese letter that used the spelling \"Giapan.\"\n\nIn summary, the name Japan ultimately derives from the Sino-Japanese readings of the kanji \u65e5\u672c, reflecting the cultural and linguistic exchanges between China and Japan over centuries.", "input_size": 320, "output_sizes": [369, 485, 451, 457, 460, 588, 479, 481, 548, 473], "output_mean": 479.1, "output_std": 55.18, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 457.75, "p50": 476.0, "p75": 484.0, "p99": 584.4}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "summarization", "gen_time": 13.53361}, {"sample_id": "918732e1e00fca4f", "prompt_id": "1881dfcbccec27e4", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Who recorded the song Ghost Town\nContext: \"Ghost Town\" is a song recorded by American singer Adam Lambert for his third studio album, The Original High (2015).

This contrasts with a regular view, which is a logical view of data defined by a query but does not store any data itself. Instead, a materialized view actually computes and stores the results of the query at the time it is created or refreshed, allowing for faster access to the data.\n\n### Key Characteristics:\n1. **Stored Data**: A materialized view contains the actual data, rather than just a reference to the data.\n2. **Query Results**: It holds the results of a predefined query, which can be used to speed up complex queries or reduce load on the source tables.\n3. **Types**:\n   - **Standard Materialized Views**: Store all rows from the query result.\n   - **Partial Materialized Views**: Store only a subset of rows or columns, such as a summary (e.g., aggregations).\n4. **Refresh**: Materialized views need to be periodically refreshed to ensure they reflect the current state of the underlying data. Refresh strategies can include full refresh, incremental refresh, etc.\n5. **Use Cases**:\n   - **Performance Optimization**: Ideal for complex queries that are run frequently, as they eliminate the need to recompute the results each time.\n   - **Data Distribution**: Useful when dealing with data distributed across multiple databases or systems.\n   - **Historical Data Analysis**: Can be used to store historical summaries or aggregations.\n\n### Example:\nSuppose you have a large table `orders` and you frequently run a query to calculate the total sales per month.

This can reduce the need to repeatedly execute the underlying query, especially if the data does not change frequently.\n\n3. **Use Cases**:\n   - **Remote Data Caching**: They can serve as a local copy of data from a remote source, reducing latency.\n   - **Subset of Data**: They can represent a subset of rows and/or columns from a larger dataset.\n   - **Aggregated Data**: They can store summarized data using aggregate functions, such as totals, averages, or counts.\n\n4. **Maintenance**: Materialized views require maintenance to keep them up-to-date with the underlying data. This typically involves refresh operations, where the view is updated to reflect changes in the base tables.\n\n5. **Database Support**: Many modern relational databases support materialized views, including Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and others.\n\nIn summary, materialized views are useful when you need to frequently access precomputed data, especially for large datasets or complex queries, as they provide performance benefits by storing the results of those queries in advance.", "input_size": 88, "output_sizes": [403, 396, 552, 381, 392, 431, 493, 395, 531, 343], "output_mean": 431.7, "output_std": 65.99, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 392.75, "p50": 399.5, "p75": 477.5, "p99": 550.11}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "closed_qa", "gen_time": 11.55508}, {"sample_id": "3c7d628a6bf3c30b", "prompt_id": "5c53fad7cce6a38a", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Considering Austin is in the central region of Texas, which of these places are in east, west, north and south.

This technique is used primarily for its therapeutic effects on the body, particularly in relation to pain management, inflammation reduction, and muscle recovery. Here\u2019s a more detailed look at its applications based on the context you provided:\n\n1. **Reduction of Swelling**: \n   - Contrast therapy can help reduce swelling associated with injuries, particularly those that present with palpable swelling, heat, and visible redness (such as strains or sprains). However, it is important to note that contrast baths are **contraindicated** during the acute inflammation stage (the first 72 hours post-injury) because they can exacerbate inflammation.\n\n2. **Muscle Recovery After Exercise**:\n   - Contrast therapy has been shown to significantly improve muscle recovery after exercise by reducing the levels of blood lactate concentration. Lactate buildup is a common byproduct of intense exercise and can contribute to muscle fatigue and soreness. By alternating between hot and cold temperatures, contrast therapy helps to flush out lactic acid and promote circulation, which aids in faster recovery.\n\n3. **Pain Management**:\n   - The alternating temperatures can help alleviate chronic pain conditions by promoting circulation and reducing muscle tension. Cold therapy reduces blood flow to the area, which can numb the pain, while heat therapy increases blood flow, bringing oxygen and nutrients to the tissues to facilitate healing.\n\n4. **General Wellness**:\n   - Regular use of contrast therapy can enhance overall wellness by improving circulation, boosting the immune system, and reducing stress. It can also help improve skin health and reduce cellulite appearance.\n\n5. **Post-Surgical Care**:\n   - In some cases, contrast therapy may be used under medical supervision to assist in the healing process after certain surgeries, though this should always be done in consultation with a healthcare provider.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- **Timing**: It's crucial to follow the recommended timing guidelines. While contrast therapy can be beneficial for recovery, it should not be applied during the acute inflammation phase.\n- **Individual Sensitivity**: Some individuals may have specific sensitivities to either hot or cold temperatures, so it\u2019s important to start slowly and monitor how the body responds.\n- **Medical Supervision**: For serious injuries or conditions, it\u2019s advisable to consult a healthcare professional before starting contrast therapy.\n\nIn summary, contrast therapy is a versatile treatment modality that can offer significant benefits in pain management, muscle recovery, and general well-being, but it should be used judiciously and with an understanding of its appropriate timing and application.", "shortest_response": "Contrast therapy, often referred to as contrast bathing or contrast hydrotherapy, involves alternating exposure to hot and cold water to stimulate blood flow and promote healing.

Her genre-spanning discography, songwriting abilities and artistic reinventions have received critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country artist to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.\nSwift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\nExiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021\u2014Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her 2022 album Midnights and single \"Anti-Hero\" broke all-time streaming records. Swift has directed music videos and films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and played supporting roles in others.\nHaving sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians in history. She is the most streamed woman on Spotify and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards; and 92 Guinness World Records. Swift has been featured in rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100.

Isn't it possible that the listener would associate \"pencil\" with \"wood\"? Maybe the listener would associate the word \"pencil\" with \"round\" instead (as pencils are, usually, in fact, round!). Wittgenstein writes regarding several possible \"interpretations\" which may arise after such a lesson. The student may interpret your pointing at a pencil and saying \"pencil\" to mean the following: (1) This is a pencil; (2) This is round; (3) This is wood; (4) This is one; (5) This is hard, etc., etc.", "longest_response": "Wittgenstein's critique of ostensive definition in the context of language learning is central to his later philosophy, particularly in *Philosophical Investigations*. He raises significant concerns about the adequacy of using simple pointing and naming as a method for teaching language, arguing that such an approach is inherently problematic because it relies on an overly simplistic model of communication.\n\nIn Wittgenstein's view, ostensive definition\u2014whereby a speaker points to an object and says a word to name it\u2014does not provide a clear or unambiguous way for the learner to understand the meaning of the word. Instead, it introduces a host of potential ambiguities and misunderstandings. Here are some key points from Wittgenstein's critique:\n\n1. **Ambiguity and Multiple Interpretations**: As you noted, the learner might associate the word \"pencil\" with various properties of the object being pointed to, such as its shape (\"round\"), material (\"wood\"), quantity (\"one\"), or other attributes. These associations can vary widely depending on the learner's experiences, culture, and context. Wittgenstein argues that there is no single, fixed relationship between a word and an object, but rather a complex network of associations and uses.\n\n2. **The Role of Language Games**: Wittgenstein introduces the concept of \"language games\" to illustrate how language functions in different contexts. In this framework, words do not have fixed meanings but are used in various ways depending on the specific game or activity in which they are employed. Ostensive definition fails to capture these dynamic uses of language, which evolve over time and across different situations.\n\n3. **The Limits of Direct Reference**: Wittgenstein challenges the idea that pointing to an object and saying a word can establish a direct, one-to-one correspondence between a word and an object. Instead, he suggests that language is more like a web of relationships, where words are used in conjunction with other words and actions. The meaning of a word emerges through its use in various language games, not through a single act of ostensive definition.\n\n4. **The Problem of Private Language**: Wittgenstein also critiques the notion that one could learn the meaning of a word privately through ostensive definition. He argues that a private language\u2014where a person associates words with their own private sensations\u2014would be impossible because there would be no way for others to verify the connection between the word and the sensation. This reinforces the idea that language is inherently public and social, and that meaning is established through shared use and understanding.\n\nIn summary, Wittgenstein views ostensive definition as insufficient for teaching language because it fails to account for the complexity and variability of language use. Meaning, he argues, is not something that can be directly imparted through a single act of pointing and naming, but rather something that develops through participation in language games and shared social practices.", "shortest_response": "Wittgenstein views the problem with learning a language through \"ostensive definition\" as deeply rooted in the ambiguity and variability of human perception and association. Ostensive definition involves pointing to an object and naming it, but Wittgenstein argues that this method alone cannot fully capture the meaning of a word because it relies too heavily on the specific context and the observer's pre-existing associations.\n\nIn the scenario you described, where someone points to a pencil and says \"pencil,\" the listener might indeed interpret the demonstration in various ways. Wittgenstein suggests that the listener could associate \"pencil\" with different properties or aspects of the object, such as its shape, material, quantity, hardness, or other characteristics. These multiple possible interpretations highlight the complexity of language and the difficulty of conveying precise meanings through simple pointing and labeling.\n\nWittgenstein's critique of ostensive definition is encapsulated in his broader philosophy of language, which emphasizes that language is not just a set of arbitrary signs but is deeply embedded in social practices and shared understandings. He argues that the meaning of words is not fixed by pointing or isolated examples but emerges from the use of those words within a community of practice. Thus, while ostensive definition can serve as a starting point for learning, it is insufficient on its own to establish the full meaning of a word.\n\nIn summary, Wittgenstein sees the problem with learning a language through ostensive definition as the potential for multiple interpretations and the failure of this method to capture the richness and context-dependence of language. Meaning, he argues, is not simply conveyed through direct association but is shaped by the web of relationships and uses within a linguistic community.", "input_size": 256, "output_sizes": [575, 398, 341, 487, 336, 508, 416, 351, 359, 564], "output_mean": 433.5, "output_std": 88.01, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 353.0, "p50": 407.0, "p75": 502.75, "p99": 574.01}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "information_extraction", "gen_time": 12.86936}, {"sample_id": "6f82af9d406e9202", "prompt_id": "2678b784a17d61a6", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Write a letter to your friend expressing your feelings about earning your first wage.", "longest_response": "Dear [Friend's Name],\n\nI hope this letter finds you well!
