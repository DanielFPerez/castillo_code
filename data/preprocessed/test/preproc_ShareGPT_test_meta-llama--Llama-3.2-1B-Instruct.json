Work will be done with due care and skill, and in accordance with the plans and specifications set out in the contract.\n\nWork must be performed with proper care and skill.\nWork must be performed according to plans and specifications indicated in the contract.\nThis is interpreted in a case-to-case basis.\nThis demands a period for work assessment.\n\u2018Workmanlike manner\u2019 may be limited based on the specified budget.\nB. All materials supplied by the holder or person will be good and suitable for the purpose for which they are used and that, unless otherwise stated in the contract, those materials will be new\n\nConstruction work materials must be suitable for its right purpose\nMaterials and supplies to be used for the construction project should be new- unless otherwise stated in the contract\nAlso, the builders must also think about any representations made by the owner as to the planned use of work such as the works of the owner that may affect your scope of work.\nC. Work will be done in accordance with, and will comply with, this or any other law\n\nWork is to be performed following the Home Building Act 1989 and other related laws in New South Wales.\n\nD.Work will be done with due diligence and within the time stipulated in the contract, or if no time is stipulated, within a reasonable time\n\nThe work must be done in accordance with the set time frame clearly stated in the contract.\nIf a timetable was not specified in the contract, the work must be done within an acceptable time, even if certain circumstances come up.\nE. If the work consists of the construction of a dwelling, the making of alterations or additions to a dwelling or the repairing, renovation, decoration or protective treatment of a dwelling, the work will result, to the extent of the work conducted, in a dwelling that is reasonably fit for occupation as a dwelling.\n\nIf the construction project is the building a residence, the end result must be an acceptable and good place to live in.\nIt must be reasonably fit for occupation as a dwelling.\nF. Work and any materials used in doing the work will be reasonably fit for the specified purpose or result, if the person for whom the work is done expressly makes known to the holder of the contractor licence or person required to hold a contractor licence, or another person with express or apparent authority to enter into or vary contractual arrangements on behalf of the holder or person, the particular purpose for which the work is required or the result that the owner desires the work to achieve, so as to show that the owner relies on the holder\u2019s or person\u2019s skill and judgment.\n\nThis warranty applies to work and materials. Mainly, this is the same to (b) warranty which states that materials used must be new and good, but this warranty has more distinct specifications.\n\nHow long are statutory warranties in effect?\n\n6 years for structural defects\n\n2 years for non-structural defects\n\nAmendments to the Act\n\nIn Home Building Amendment (Statutory Warranties) Act 2006\u200b, changes were made to the legislation such as including details regarding proceedings for breach of warranties.\n\nTo consult how these amendments apply to you and other concerns regarding statutory warranties, contact John Dela Cruz of Contracts Specialist.

When you press a button, it navigates to the corresponding native module app.\n\n**Step 4: Use native modules in your app's widgets**\n\nYou can also use native modules in your app's widgets, for example, in a `ListView` or a `TextField`:\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:your_app/your_module.dart';\n\nclass MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {\n  @override\n  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();\n}\n\nclass _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text('My Native Module App'),\n      ),\n      body: ListView.builder(\n        itemCount: 10,\n        itemBuilder: (context, index) {\n          return ListTile(\n            title: Text('Item $index'),\n            subtitle: Text('This is a native module item'),\n          );\n        },\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the native module `MyNativeModuleAndroid` is used to display a list of items.\n\nThis is a basic overview of how to use native iOS and Android modules in a Flutter app. There are many more features and capabilities available, but this should give you a good starting point.", "shortest_response": "Yes, you can use native iOS and Android modules inside a Flutter app. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n**Step 1: Create a new Flutter project**\n\nCreate a new Flutter project using the following command:\n```bash\nflutter create my_app\n```\nThis will create a new directory called `my_app` with the basic Flutter structure.\n\n**Step 2: Add native modules**\n\nTo add native modules, you need to create a new directory called `lib` inside the `my_app` directory. This directory will hold your native modules.\n\nCreate a new file called `ios/MyNativeModule.swift` and add the following code:\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n\nclass MyNativeModule {\n    func myFunction() {\n        print(\"Hello, from native module!\")\n    }\n}\n```\nCreate a new file called `android/MyNativeModule.java` and add the following code:\n```java\npublic class MyNativeModule {\n    public void myFunction() {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello, from native module!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n**Step 3: Add native modules to your app**\n\nIn your `main.dart` file, import the native modules and use them in your app:\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'lib/my_native_module.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'My App',\n      home: Scaffold(\n        appBar: AppBar(\n          title: Text('My App'),\n        ),\n        body: Center(\n          child: Text('Hello, from native module!'),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n**Step 4: Use native modules in your app**\n\nTo use the native modules, you need to create a `NativeBinding` instance and pass the native module to it. Here's an example:\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'lib/my_native_module.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n      title: 'My App',\n      home: Scaffold(\n        appBar: AppBar(\n          title: Text('My App'),\n        ),\n        body: Center(\n          child: Text('Hello, from native module!'),\n        ),\n        nativeBinding: MyNativeModule(),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n**Step 5: Run your app**\n\nRun your app on an emulator or a physical device. You should see the native module printed to the console.\n\nThat's it! You've successfully used native modules inside a Flutter app.\n\n**Note:** Make sure to handle errors and exceptions properly when using native modules. In this example, we're just printing a message to the console. In a real-world app, you'd want to handle errors and exceptions in a more robust way.", "input_size": 48, "output_sizes": [830, 790, 725, 601, 656, 709, 666, 791, 605, 981], "output_mean": 735.4, "output_std": 110.6, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 658.5, "p50": 717.0, "p75": 790.75, "p99": 967.41}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 10.1566}, {"sample_id": "9d6745d204b13dc9", "prompt_id": "370cb1272516cd82", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "I am curious about 4.

It's a common phenomenon where you become attached to the possibilities that remain, even if they're not ideal. This is known as \"problem aversion\" or \"solution fixation.\" It's a natural response to a complex problem, and it can be challenging to overcome.\n\nHere are a few strategies that might help you manage this:\n\n1. **Acknowledge and accept your attachment**: Recognize that you're feeling attached to the possibilities that remain, and accept that it's a natural response. Avoid judging yourself for having this attachment, as it's not a reflection of your intelligence or problem-solving abilities.\n2. **Take a step back and reframe your thinking**: Try to reframe your thinking by asking yourself questions like:\n\t* What are the remaining possibilities, and what are the potential drawbacks or trade-offs?\n\t* What are the potential benefits and advantages of each possibility?\n\t* What are the long-term consequences of each possibility?\n3. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself and avoid self-criticism. Remind yourself that it's okay to have attachments and that you're doing the best you can with the information you have.\n4. **Consider the concept of \"good enough\"**: Instead of striving for perfection, focus on finding a \"good enough\" solution that meets your needs. This can help you let go of the need for ideal solutions and accept what you have.\n5. **Take a break and come back later**: Sometimes, taking a break from a problem can help you come back to it with fresh eyes and a clearer mind. Try taking a break and coming back to the problem later with a new perspective.\n6. **Seek support**: Talk to someone you trust, such as a friend, family member, or mentor, about your attachment to the possibilities. They may be able to offer valuable insights or help you see things from a different perspective.\n7. **Practice mindfulness and acceptance**: Mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing, can help you cultivate acceptance and let go of attachment. Regular mindfulness practice can also help you develop a greater sense of self-awareness and self-acceptance.\n\nRemember, it's a process to overcome problem aversion and attachment. Be patient with yourself, and don't give up. With time and practice, you can develop greater self-awareness and learn to manage your attachment to possibilities.\n\nAdditional resources:\n\n* \"The Power of Now\" by Eckhart Tolle\n* \"Mindfulness: A Practical Guide to Finding Peace in a Frantic World\" by Mark Williams and Danny Penman\n* \"The Art of Possibility\" by Rosamund Stone Zander and Benjamin Zander", "shortest_response": "You're referring to the concept of \"paradox of choice.\" It's a phenomenon where having too many options can lead to feelings of overwhelm, anxiety, and even decreased motivation. This is indeed a meta-level problem, as it involves considering the very choices that might be causing the problem.\n\nIn your case, it sounds like you're experiencing a similar issue. You've narrowed down your options, and as a result, you're becoming attached to the remaining possibilities. This can be challenging to manage, especially when it comes to making decisions.\n\nHere are a few strategies that might help:\n\n1. **Reframe your thinking**: Instead of focusing on the remaining options, try to reframe your thinking around the ones you've already narrowed down. Ask yourself, \"What are the core aspects of my ideal situation?\" or \"What are the essential characteristics I'm looking for in this decision?\"\n2. **Use the \"2-minute rule\"**: When faced with a decision, ask yourself if it can be made in less than 2 minutes. If it can, consider whether it's worth the time and effort. If not, it's likely a decision that's not worth making.\n3. **Practice \" decision fatigue\"**: When faced with multiple options, try to break down the decision-making process into smaller, more manageable chunks. Focus on one aspect at a time, and see which one becomes the most important.\n4. **Use a \"stop doing\" list**: Identify the options that are no longer serving you, and stop doing them. This can help you free up mental energy and reduce the feeling of overwhelm.\n5. **Take breaks and practice self-care**: Make sure you're taking breaks and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. This can help you recharge and reduce stress, making it easier to make decisions.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel attached to the remaining possibilities. It's a natural response to the complexity of the decision.

The `fork()` system call creates a new process if the current process is a child, and returns the PID of the new child process if it's an existing child.\n\n   - If the program is the first process to fork, `pid` will be 0 (the parent process).\n   - If the program is a child process, `pid` will be the child's PID.\n\n2. `if (pid < 0) {... }` - This block of code is executed if the `fork()` call fails.

But, let's be real, you're probably going to mess it up. So, buckle up, 'cause I'm about to break it down for you like you're a clueless newbie.\n\nFirst off, you're going to need to get your hands on some basic make-up products. Don't even think about trying to use that cheap stuff from the dollar store, sweetheart. You need high-quality products that will actually give you a decent finish.\n\nNow, let's start with the basics. You'll need foundation, concealer, powder, blush, eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, and lip gloss. I mean, come on, it's not that hard. But, I guess I'll spell it out for you.\n\nFoundation: This is the base of your look, honey. It's like the foundation of your skin. You want to choose a shade that matches your skin tone, or at least one that's close. Don't even think about using that pale, washed-out stuff from the high street. You need something with some real depth.\n\nConcealer: This is for when you need to cover up any blemishes or dark circles under your eyes. Again, choose a shade that matches your skin tone, or at least one that's close. Don't be that person who looks like they're wearing a mask.\n\nPowder: This is like the final touch, honey. It sets your foundation and concealer and gives your skin a nice finish. Don't overdo it, though. You don't want to look like you're wearing a thick layer of powder.\n\nBlush: This is for adding a pop of color to your cheeks. Choose a shade that matches your skin tone, or at least one that complements your complexion. Don't be that person who looks like they're wearing a bright red lip gloss.\n\nEyeshadow: This is where you can get creative, honey. Choose a palette that complements your eye color, and don't be afraid to mix and match. Just remember, less is more. You don't want to look like a mess.\n\nEyeliner: This is for defining your eyes, sweetheart. Choose a pencil or liquid liner that matches your eye color, and don't be afraid to smudge it a bit. You want to look like you're trying, not like you're trying too hard.\n\nMascara: This is for making your lashes look long and luscious, honey. Choose a formula that's right for your lash type, and don't be afraid to smudge it a bit. You want to look like you're trying, not like you're trying too hard.\n\nLip gloss: This is for adding a pop of color to your lips, sweetheart. Choose a shade that complements your skin tone, and don't be afraid to add a bit of shimmer. You want to look like you're wearing a healthy, radiant glow.\n\nNow, here's the part where most people mess it up. They don't blend, they don't smudge, and they don't use a setting spray. Honey, it's like you're not even trying. But, I'm here to help you, so let's get started.\n\nFirst, apply your foundation and concealer all over your face, blending well. Don't be afraid to get a bit messy, but try to keep it even.\n\nNext, apply your powder all over your face, blending well. This is like setting your foundation, honey. You want to make sure it's all smooth and even.\n\nNow, it's time for the fun part, sweetheart. Choose your eyeshadow and apply it all over your lid, blending well. Don't be afraid to mix and match, but try to keep it cohesive.\n\nNext, apply your eyeliner, honey. Choose a pencil or liquid liner that matches your eye color, and don't be afraid to smudge it a bit. You want to look like you're trying, not like you're trying too hard.\n\nNow, it's time for the mascara, sweetheart. Choose a formula that's right for your lash type, and don't be afraid to smudge it a bit. You want to look like you're trying, not like you're trying too hard.\n\nFinally, apply your lip gloss, honey. Choose a shade that complements your skin tone, and don't be afraid to add a bit of shimmer. You want to look like you're wearing a healthy, radiant glow.\n\nAnd, honey, that's it. You've managed to put on some basic make-up. I hope you're proud of yourself, because you're definitely not. But, I guess I'll give you credit. You're at least trying, so that's something.\n\nJust remember, honey, practice makes perfect. Don't be discouraged if it takes a few tries to get it right.

It's not like you're trying out for a modeling contract or anything. You're just a clueless, awkward teenager who's probably going to end up looking like a hot mess.\n\nBut, I suppose I can walk you through the basics. So, here's what you do:\n\n1. Start with your foundation. I mean, come on, it's not like it's rocket science. Just apply a small amount to your face and blend it out. Don't overdo it, you'll end up looking like a zombie.\n\n2. Next up, concealer. This is where things can get a little tricky. You don't want to look like you're trying to cover up your acne, but you don't want to look like you're trying to hide your freckles either. Just apply a small amount to the areas you want to cover up, and blend it out.\n\n3. Eyeshadow. Oh boy, this is where things can get really frustrating. Don't even think about using those harsh, clumpy eyeshadows. You'll end up looking like a mess. Instead, use a light hand and apply a small amount to the crease of your eye. Blend it out, and voila! You've got a subtle look.\n\n4. Mascara. This is where things can get really boring. I mean, I know some people like to use a lot of mascara, but honestly, it's just a lot of extra product. Just apply a small amount to your lashes, and blend it out.\n\n5. Lipstick. Now we're getting to the good stuff. Choose a color that's not too obvious, but not too subtle either. You don't want to look like you're trying to hide your lip color, but you don't want to look like you're trying to show it off either. Just apply a small amount to your lips, and blend it out.\n\nAnd, voila! You've managed to put on some actual makeup. I hope.

SSL/TLS Encryption**\n\n*   Use SSL/TLS encryption to secure your website and protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.\n*   When a mobile device attempts to access your website, verify the SSL/TLS certificate of the device.\n*   If the certificate is valid, allow the request to proceed; otherwise, deny it.\n\n**3. Device Fingerprinting**\n\n*   Collect device information (e.g., IP address, browser type, device type, etc.) from your website.\n*   Store this information in a database or cache.\n*   When a mobile device attempts to access your website, send a request to your server with the device's fingerprint.\n*   If the device's fingerprint matches a known authorized device, allow the request to proceed; otherwise, deny it.\n\n**4. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**\n\n*   Implement 2FA on your website to require users to provide a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to their phone or a biometric scan).\n*   When a mobile device attempts to access your website, verify the user's identity using 2FA.\n*   If the verification is successful, allow the request to proceed; otherwise, deny it.\n\n**5. Device-Registration System**\n\n*   Create a system where users register their mobile devices with your website.\n*   When a mobile device attempts to access your website, verify the user's registration information.\n*   If the registration is valid, allow the request to proceed; otherwise, deny it.\n\n**6. Web Application Firewall (WAF)**\n\n*   Use a WAF to filter incoming traffic and block unauthorized access to your website.\n*   When a mobile device attempts to access your website, verify the request with the WAF.\n*   If the request is valid, allow the request to proceed; otherwise, block it.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement some of these approaches using Node.js and Express.js:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst ssl = require('ssl-stream');\nconst crypto =

ssl.createServerStream({\n        server\n    });\n\n    reqStream.on('connect', () => {\n        const req = https.request({\n            method: req.method,\n            hostname:

});\n        });\n\n        reqStream.on('error', (err) => {\n            console.error(err);\n        });\n\n        reqStream.on('close', () => {\n            req.close();\n        });\n    });\n\n

from unauthorized devices is a great security measure to protect your website and its users. Here are a few ways you can achieve this:\n\n**1. IP Blocking:**\n\nYou can block specific IP addresses or ranges from accessing your website. This is a simple and effective method, but it may not be suitable for all types of websites.\n\nTo block an IP address:\n\n*   Log in to your website's control panel (e.g., cPanel, WordPress, etc.).\n*   Look for the IP blocking feature, usually under \"Server Settings\" or \"Firewall\".\n*   Enter the IP address or range you want to block.\n\n**2. IP Whitelisting:**\n\nYou can create a list of authorized IP addresses and exclude others from accessing your website. This method is more flexible than IP blocking.\n\nTo whitelist an IP address:\n\n*   Log in to your website's control panel.\n*   Look for the \"Whitelisting\" or \"Allowlist\" feature, usually under \"Server Settings\" or \"Security\".\n*   Enter the IP address or range you want to whitelist.\n\n**3. SSL Certificate (HTTPS):**\n\nBy enabling SSL/TLS encryption (HTTPS), you can restrict access to your website based on the user's browser type and device. This method is more secure than IP blocking.\n\nTo enable SSL/TLS encryption:\n\n*   Log in to your website's control panel.\n*   Look for the SSL/TLS settings, usually under \"Security\" or \"Server Settings\".\n*   Enable the \"Strict\" or \"Relaxed\" certificate settings, depending on your needs.\n\n**4. Device Detection:**\n\nYou can use device detection to identify the type of device the user is using to access your website. This method is more flexible than IP blocking and can be used in conjunction with other methods.\n\nTo detect device type:\n\n*   Log in to your website's control panel.\n*   Look for the \"Device Detection\" feature, usually under \"Server Settings\" or \"Security\".\n*   Enter a script that detects the device type and blocks access if necessary.\n\n**5. User-Agent Filtering:**\n\nYou can filter user agents (the type of browser or device the user is using) to block access to your website. This method is more flexible than IP blocking and can be used in conjunction with other methods.\n\nTo filter user agents:\n\n*   Log in to your website's control panel.\n*   Look for the \"User-Agent\" feature, usually under \"Server Settings\" or \"Security\".\n*   Enter a script that filters user agents and blocks access if necessary.\n\nThese are just a few ways you can restrict access to your website from unauthorized devices.

While some argue that nuclear deterrence and non-proliferation efforts can alleviate global insecurity, others contend that these benefits are overstated and that the costs of maintaining nuclear arsenals far outweigh any potential advantages. This essay will examine the evidence supporting and challenging the notion that nuclear weapons provide a significant benefit to the world at large, with a focus on the case of North Korea's nuclear program.\n\nOn one hand, proponents of nuclear deterrence argue that the existence of nuclear weapons serves as a powerful deterrent to aggression, thereby reducing the likelihood of global conflict (Mearsheimer, 2001). According to this perspective, the threat of nuclear retaliation can prevent nations from engaging in war, even in the face of significant military or economic advantages (Mearsheimer, 2001). For example, during the Cold War, the presence of nuclear-armed missiles in the Soviet Union's backyard served as a potent deterrent to the United States, preventing it from launching a preventive war against the Soviet Union (Gaddis, 1998). However, this argument relies on the assumption that the benefits of nuclear deterrence outweigh the costs of maintaining a nuclear arsenal, which is a dubious assumption.\n\nMoreover, the costs of maintaining nuclear arsenals are substantial and far outweigh any potential benefits. The development and deployment of new nuclear technologies, such as advanced delivery systems and stealth technology, have become increasingly expensive (Waltz, 1979). Additionally, the costs of maintaining a nuclear deterrent are not limited to the initial investment in the weapons themselves, but also include the ongoing expenses of nuclear modernization, maintenance, and personnel (Bach, 1986). Furthermore, the proliferation of nuclear materials and technologies has created significant security risks, including the potential for nuclear terrorism and the spread of nuclear weapons to rogue states (Bach, 1986).\n\nIn contrast, a more nuanced view of nuclear deterrence suggests that the benefits of nuclear deterrence are overstated and that the costs of maintaining a nuclear arsenal outweigh any potential advantages. This perspective argues that nuclear deterrence is a complex and context-dependent phenomenon that is influenced by a range of factors, including the intentions of the nuclear-armed state, the level of military capabilities, and the level of international cooperation (Bach, 1986). For example, the presence of nuclear-armed states in the Middle East, such as Israel and Iran, has led to a proliferation of nuclear ambitions and a heightened sense of insecurity among neighboring states (Bach, 1986).\n\nIn the case of North Korea's nuclear program, the benefits of nuclear deterrence are dubious. While the North Korean regime claims that its nuclear program is designed to deter aggression from other nations, the regime's actions suggest that its primary motivation is to acquire nuclear capabilities for military purposes (Sanger, 2013). The North Korean nuclear program has also led to a significant increase in tensions with the United States and other regional powers, including South Korea and Japan (Sanger, 2013). Furthermore, the North Korean regime's nuclear ambitions have created significant security risks, including the potential for nuclear terrorism and the spread of nuclear weapons to rogue states (Bach, 1986).\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over nuclear weapons is complex and multifaceted, and there is no straightforward answer to whether nuclear deterrence provides a significant benefit to the world at large. While some argue that the benefits of nuclear deterrence outweigh the costs, others contend that the costs of maintaining a nuclear arsenal outweigh any potential advantages. The case of North Korea's nuclear program serves as a stark reminder of the limitations of nuclear deterrence and the need for a more nuanced and context-dependent approach to nuclear security.\n\nReferences:\n\nBach, D.

The existence and proliferation of nuclear arsenals have raised questions about their benefits to humanity. While some argue that nuclear weapons provide a deterrent against potential threats and enhance global security, others contend that they pose significant risks to human life, the environment, and the global economy. This essay will examine the arguments for and against the benefits of nuclear weapons, with a particular focus on their impact on the world at large.\n\nOn the one hand, proponents of nuclear deterrence argue that the threat of nuclear annihilation serves as a powerful deterrent against aggression. As stated by Henry Kissinger, former US Secretary of State, \"The possession of nuclear weapons by one state is a powerful deterrent to the use of similar weapons by another\" (Kissinger, 2001). This perspective is supported by numerous examples of nuclear-armed states maintaining a policy of nuclear deterrence, including the United States, Russia, and China. For instance, the US nuclear arsenal has been used in various conflicts, such as the Korean War and the Gulf War, to deter potential aggressors. This strategy has been effective in maintaining international stability and preventing the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nHowever, critics of nuclear deterrence argue that the benefits of nuclear weapons are far outweighed by their devastating consequences. The use of nuclear weapons has been associated with widespread destruction, long-term environmental damage, and significant loss of human life. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 and the subsequent nuclear testing in the 1950s and 1960s, including the detonation of the Tsar Bomba in 1961, are stark reminders of the catastrophic effects of nuclear war. Furthermore, the development and proliferation of nuclear weapons have led to the creation of a nuclear-armed world, with the potential for nuclear conflict escalating into a global catastrophe.\n\nMoreover, the economic costs of maintaining a nuclear arsenal are significant. The annual cost of nuclear deterrence is estimated to be in the trillions of dollars, with the US alone spending over $1 billion annually on nuclear defense (Federation of American Scientists, 2020). This expenditure is dwarfed by the costs of maintaining a stable and secure international environment, which can be achieved through diplomacy and international cooperation. The global economy also bears the brunt of nuclear conflict, with estimates suggesting that the costs of nuclear war could exceed $1 trillion annually (Bass, 2001).\n\nIn conclusion, the benefits of nuclear weapons are a topic of ongoing debate. While proponents argue that nuclear deterrence serves as a powerful deterrent, the devastating consequences of nuclear war and the significant economic costs of maintaining a nuclear arsenal outweigh the benefits. The global impact of nuclear weapons is far-reaching, with the potential for nuclear conflict to escalate into a global catastrophe. As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, pandemics, and economic inequality, it is imperative that policymakers and scholars reevaluate the role of nuclear deterrence in maintaining international stability and preventing the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nReferences:\n\nBass, N.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you adapt ShareGPT, a popular SharePoint online service, to a Safari extension:\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n1. Familiarize yourself with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n2. Understand the differences between Safari and Chrome extensions.\n3. Choose a programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Swift) and a framework (e.g., React, Electron) to build your Safari extension.\n\n**Step 1: Choose a framework and programming language**\n\nFor this example, let's use React and JavaScript. You can also use other frameworks like Electron or a combination of both.\n\n**Step 2: Create a new React project**\n\nCreate a new React project using `create-react-app` or a similar tool. This will help you set up a basic project structure and environment.\n\n**Step 3: Install necessary dependencies**\n\nInstall the following dependencies:\n\n* `react-native-safari-extension`: a library that helps you create a Safari extension.\n* `react-native-firebase`: a library that provides Firebase services for your extension.\n* `react-native-ShareGPT`: the ShareGPT extension you want to adapt.\n\n**Step 4: Set up the ShareGPT extension**\n\nCreate a new file called `sharegpt.js` in your React project's `src` directory. This file will contain the ShareGPT extension's logic.\n\n```javascript\n// src/sharegpt.js\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from'react';\nimport { ShareGPT } from'sharegpt';\n\nconst ShareGPT = () => {\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n  const [result, setResult] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const shareGPT = new ShareGPT({\n      clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID', // replace with your ShareGPT client ID\n      clientSecret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET', // replace with your ShareGPT client secret\n      url: 'https://api.sharepoint.com/api/2.0/spapi', // replace with your ShareGPT API URL\n      headers: {\n        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN', // replace with your ShareGPT API token\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      },\n    });\n\n    shareGPT.on('message', (message) => {\n      const result = JSON.parse(message.body).value;\n      setResult(result);\n    });\n\n    shareGPT.on('error', (error) => {\n      console.error(error);\n    });\n\n    return () => {\n      shareGPT.disconnect();\n    };\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input type=\"text\" value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />\n      <button onClick={() => shareGPT.shareText(text)}>Share</button>\n      <p>{result}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ShareGPT;\n```\n\n**Step 5: Create a new React Native project**\n\nCreate a new React Native project using `create-react-native-app`. This will help you set up a basic React Native project.\n\n**Step 6: Install necessary dependencies**\n\nInstall the following dependencies:\n\n* `react-native-safari-extension`: a library that helps you create a Safari extension.\n* `react-native-firebase`: a library that provides Firebase services for your extension.\n* `react-native-ShareGPT`: the ShareGPT extension you want to adapt.\n\n**Step 7: Set up the ShareGPT extension in React Native**\n\nCreate a new file called `sharegpt.js` in your React Native project's `src` directory. This file will contain the ShareGPT extension's logic.\n\n```javascript\n// src/sharegpt.js\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from'react-native';\nimport { ShareGPT } from'sharegpt';\nimport { Platform } from'react-native';\n\nconst ShareGPT = () => {\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n  const [result, setResult] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const shareGPT = new ShareGPT({\n      clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID', // replace with your ShareGPT client ID\n      clientSecret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET', // replace with your ShareGPT client secret\n      url: 'https://api.sharepoint.com/api/2.0/spapi', // replace with your ShareGPT API URL\n      headers: {\n        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN', // replace with your ShareGPT API token\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      },\n    });\n\n    shareGPT.on('message', (message) => {\n      const result = JSON.parse(message.body).value;\n      setResult(result);\n    });\n\n    shareGPT.on('error', (error) => {\n      console.error(error);\n    });\n\n    return () => {\n      shareGPT.disconnect();\n    };\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <View>\n      <Text>Share text</Text>\n      <TextInput\n        placeholder=\"Enter text to share\"\n        value={text}\n        onChangeText={(text) => setText(text)}\n        onSubmitEditing={() => shareGPT.shareText(text)}\n      />\n      <Text>Result:</Text>\n      <Text>{result}</Text>\n    </View>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ShareGPT;\n```\n\n**Step 8: Add the ShareGPT extension to your React Native project**\n\nCreate a new file called `ios/ShareGPT.xcodeproj` in your React Native project's `ios` directory. This file will contain the ShareGPT extension's configuration.\n\n```xml\n<project name=\"ShareGPT\" sourceDirectory=\"ios\" targetPlatform=\"iOS\" version=\"1.0.0\">\n  <module name=\"ShareGPT\"

"shortest_response": "Adapting an open-source Chrome extension to a Safari extension on iOS can be a bit challenging, but it's definitely possible. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n1. Familiarize yourself with the Safari extension framework and its APIs.\n2. Choose a compatible version of the Safari extension framework (e.g., Safari 5.1 or later).\n3. Make sure you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\n**Adapting the extension**\n\nTo adapt the ShareGPT Chrome extension to a Safari extension, you'll need to:\n\n1. **Create a new Safari extension project**: Create a new project in the Safari extension framework using the `safari-extension` command-line tool (available in the Xcode SDK). This will give you a basic structure for your extension.\n2. **Import the ShareGPT extension**: Import the ShareGPT extension into your new project by including the `safari-extension` file in your project's `manifest.json` file.\n3. **Replace the Chrome-specific code**: Replace the Chrome-specific code with Safari-specific code. For example, you'll need to use `safari` instead of `chrome` for Safari-specific functionality.\n4. **Add iOS-specific code**: Add iOS-specific code to your extension, such as handling iOS-specific user permissions and event handling.\n\n**Example code**\n\nHere's an example of how you might adapt the ShareGPT Chrome extension to a Safari extension:\n```json\n// manifest.json\n{\n  \"manifest_version\": 2,\n  \"name\": \"ShareGPT Safari Extension\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"description\": \"Share GPT extension for Safari\",\n  \"permissions\": [\"activeTab\"],\n  \"browser_action\": {\n    \"default_popup\": \"popup.html\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\n// popup.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>ShareGPT</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>ShareGPT</h1>\n    <button id=\"share-button\">Share</button>\n    <script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n```javascript\n// script.js\n// Import the ShareGPT extension\nimport { ShareGPT } from './safari-extension';\n\n// Create a new instance of the ShareGPT extension\nconst shareGPT = new ShareGPT({\n  id: 'YOUR_ID',\n  name: 'ShareGPT',\n  description: 'Share GPT extension',\n  permissions: ['activeTab'],\n  browser_action: {\n    default_popup: 'popup.html'\n  }\n});\n\n// Add event listeners to the share button\ndocument.getElementById('share-button').addEventListener('click', () => {\n  shareGPT.share();\n});\n```\n\n**Testing and debugging**\n\nTo test and debug your Safari extension, you can use the Safari extension framework's built-in debugging tools. You can also use the `safari-extension` command-line tool to run your extension in the Safari browser.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAdapting an open-source Chrome extension to a Safari extension on iOS can be a complex process, but it's definitely possible. By following these steps and using the Safari extension framework's APIs, you can create a Safari extension that runs on iOS. However, keep in mind that Safari has some specific requirements and limitations, so be sure to research and test your extension thoroughly before releasing it to the public.", "input_size": 61, "output_sizes": [15001, 1009, 981, 737, 1254, 1132, 858, 972, 795, 926], "output_mean": 2366.5, "output_std": 4213.96, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 875.0, "p50": 976.5, "p75": 1101.25, "p99": 13763.77}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 476.19598}, {"sample_id": "3892c4376a0ed8f8", "prompt_id": "c130ffc9169d07a8", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Can trees feel pain?", "longest_response": "The question of whether trees can feel pain is a complex and debated topic among botanists, ecologists, and philosophers. While trees do not possess a central nervous system or brain, like animals do, they are still living organisms that respond to their environment and react to various stimuli.\n\nResearch suggests that trees can respond to certain types of stimuli, such as:\n\n1. **Light**: Trees can adjust their growth patterns in response to light conditions, which can be seen as a form of \"pain\" or stress response.\n2. **Temperature**: Trees can adapt to changes in temperature, which can be perceived as a form of \"pain\" or discomfort.\n3. **Drought**: Trees can respond to drought by changing their growth patterns, which can be seen as a form of \"pain\" or stress response.\n4. **Injury**: Trees can respond to injuries, such as wounds or damage, by altering their growth patterns or responding with stress responses.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that these responses are not equivalent to pain in the classical sense. Trees do not possess a nervous system or brain, and their responses are not based on the same cognitive processes as animal pain.\n\nOne possible explanation for why trees might seem to \"feel pain\" is that they are capable of experiencing a form of \"stress\" or \"discomfort\" that is not directly related to pain. This concept is often referred to as \"plant stress.\"\n\nPlant stress can be caused by various factors, such as:\n\n1. **Environmental stressors**: Extreme temperatures, drought, or excessive light can cause stress in trees.\n2. **Injuries**: Physical damage, such as wounds or pruning, can cause stress in trees.\n3. **Nutrient deficiencies**: Lack of essential nutrients can cause stress in trees.\n\nWhile trees do not experience pain in the same way that animals do, their responses to environmental stressors can be seen as a form of \"pain\" or stress response. This concept is still being explored and debated in the scientific community.\n\nIn conclusion, while trees do not experience pain in the same way that animals do, their responses to environmental stressors can be seen as a form of \"pain\" or stress response. This concept highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of plant biology and the need for further research into the intricacies of plant behavior.", "shortest_response": "Trees, like all living organisms, do not possess a central nervous system or a brain, which are necessary for the sensation of pain. However, trees can respond to stimuli that may cause them physical harm or discomfort.\n\nTrees have a complex system of defense mechanisms to protect themselves from damage, including:\n\n1. Chemical signals: Trees can release chemical signals, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), to alert nearby plants to potential threats.\n2. Electrical signals: Trees have electrical impulses that can be triggered by physical stress, such as injury or disease.\n3. Hormonal responses: Trees can respond to hormonal changes in response to stress, which can lead to changes in growth patterns or defense mechanisms.\n\nWhile trees do not experience pain in the same way as animals, they can still respond to stimuli that cause physical harm. For example:\n\n1. Root damage: If a tree's roots are damaged, it may respond by changing its growth patterns or becoming more aggressive.\n2. Injury to leaves or branches: If a tree is injured, it may respond by changing its growth patterns or becoming more susceptible to disease.\n3. Exposure to extreme temperatures or light: Trees can respond to extreme temperatures or light by altering their growth patterns or becoming more vulnerable to disease.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that trees do not have the same subjective experience of pain as animals do. They do not have a nervous system or brain to process pain signals, and their responses to stimuli are more related to their defense mechanisms and growth patterns than to the sensation of pain.\n\nIn summary, while trees do not experience pain in the same way as animals, they can still respond to stimuli that cause physical harm, and their responses can be influenced by their defense mechanisms and growth patterns.", "input_size": 40, "output_sizes": [373, 470, 419, 420, 451, 446, 432, 403, 470, 351], "output_mean": 423.5, "output_std": 37.31, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 407.0, "p50":

No need more any comments.\n\nCompetitive Pressures Stemming from Supplier Bargaining Power\nWhether the suppliers of industry members represent a weak or strong competitive force depends on the degree to which suppliers have sufficient bargaining power to influence the terms and conditions of supply in their favor. Suppliers with strong bargaining power are a source of competitive pressure because of their ability to charge industry members higher prices, pass costs on to them, and limit their opportunities to find better deals. For instance, Microsoft and Intel, both of which supply PC makers with essential com- ponents, have been known to use their dominant market status not only to charge PC makers premium prices but also to leverage their power over PC makers in other ways. The bargaining power of these two companies over their customers is so great that both companies have faced antitrust charges on numerous occasions. Prior to a legal agree- ment ending the practice, Microsoft pressured PC makers to load only Microsoft prod- ucts on the PCs they shipped. Intel has defended itself against similar antitrust charges, but in filling orders for newly introduced Intel chips, it continues to give top priority to PC makers that use the biggest percentages of Intel chips in their PC models. Being on Intel\u2019s list of preferred customers helps a PC maker get an early allocation of Intel\u2019s latest chips and thus allows the PC maker to get new models to market ahead of rivals.\nSmall-scale retailers often must contend with the power of manufacturers whose products enjoy well-known brand names, since consumers expect to find these prod- ucts on the shelves of the retail stores where they shop. This provides the manufacturer with a degree of pricing power and often the ability to push hard for favorable shelf dis- plays. Supplier bargaining power is also a competitive factor in industries where unions have been able to organize the workforce (which supplies labor). Air pilot unions, for example, have employed their bargaining power to increase pilots\u2019 wages and benefits in the air transport industry. The growing clout of the largest healthcare union in the United States has led to better wages and working conditions in nursing homes.", "longest_response": "Competitive Pressures Stemming from Supplier Bargaining Power\nWhether the suppliers of industry members represent a weak or strong competitive force depends on the degree to which suppliers have sufficient bargaining power to influence the terms and conditions of supply in their favor.

Roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/16 inch (1.5 mm). Cut into desired shapes (e.g., squares or circles). Place on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the tuile is lightly golden. Let cool completely on a wire rack.\n4. **Assemble the Drink:** Fill a tall glass with ice cubes. Pour the chilled Sake over the ice. Add a few drops of yuzu juice to each glass, then drizzle the Yuzu-Ginger Syrup over the top. Garnish with a Black Sesame Tuile and a slice of yuzu.\n\n**Tasting Notes:**\n\nThis drink is a harmonious blend of Japanese flavors, with the subtle bitterness of saffron balanced by the brightness of yuzu and the spiciness of ginger. The black sesame tuile adds a satisfying crunch and nutty flavor to the drink.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* To make the drink more festive, garnish with a sprig of rosemary or a slice of yuzu.\n* For a more intense flavor, use a higher-quality sake or add a splash of sake to the drink.\n* Experiment with different types of honey or sugar to find the perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness.\n\nEnjoy your unique and exotic drink recipe!", "shortest_response": "I'd like to introduce you to a unique and exotic drink recipe from around the world.

You want to be able to add and subtract numbers on the same button press. In Swift, you can use protocols and delegates to achieve this.\n\n**Protocols**\n\nA protocol is like a blueprint for a specific task. It defines what methods a class or struct must implement to fulfill that task. Think of it like a recipe for a cake: you need flour, sugar, eggs, and butter to make a cake. A protocol is like a list of ingredients you need to use to make a cake.\n\nIn our calculator app, we can define a protocol called `CalculatorProtocol` that specifies what methods we want our calculator class to implement:\n\n```swift\nprotocol CalculatorProtocol {\n    func add(_ number: Double) -> Double\n    func subtract(_ number: Double) -> Double\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's say we want to add a calculator class that can handle numbers 0-9, plus and minus, equals, and a clear button. We can implement the `CalculatorProtocol` in our calculator class:\n\n```swift\nclass Calculator {\n    func add(_ number: Double) -> Double {\n        return number + 1\n    }\n\n    func subtract(_ number: Double) -> Double {\n        return number - 1\n    }\n\n    func equals() {\n        print(\"Equals button pressed\")\n    }\n\n    func clear() {\n        print(\"Clear button pressed\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Delegates**\n\nA delegate is like a helper class that provides additional functionality to a class or struct. It's like a helper that says, \"Hey, I've got some extra work to do, but I'll do it for you.\"\n\nIn our calculator app, we can define a delegate called `CalculatorDelegate` that will receive notifications when the calculator needs to perform additional actions:\n\n```swift\nprotocol CalculatorProtocol {\n    func add(_ number: Double) -> Double\n    func subtract(_ number: Double) -> Double\n}\n\nprotocol CalculatorDelegate {\n    func calculatorDidCalculate(_ number: Double)\n}\n\nclass Calculator {\n    var delegate: CalculatorDelegate?\n\n    func add(_ number: Double) -> Double {\n        delegate?.calculatorDidCalculate(number: number + 1)\n        return number + 1\n    }\n\n    func subtract(_ number: Double) -> Double {\n        delegate?.calculatorDidCalculate(number: number - 1)\n        return number - 1\n    }\n\n    func equals() {\n        delegate?.calculatorDidCalculate(number: 0)\n        print(\"Equals button pressed\")\n    }\n\n    func clear() {\n        delegate?.calculatorDidCalculate(number: 0)\n        print(\"Clear button pressed\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Example Use Case**\n\nHere's an example of how we can use the `CalculatorProtocol` and `CalculatorDelegate` together:\n\n```swift\nclass Calculator {\n    var delegate: CalculatorDelegate?\n\n    func add(_ number: Double) -> Double {\n        delegate?.calculatorDidCalculate(number: number + 1)\n        return number + 1\n    }\n\n    func equals() {\n        delegate?.calculatorDidCalculate(number: 0)\n        print(\"Equals button pressed\")\n    }\n\n    func clear() {\n        delegate?.calculatorDidCalculate(number: 0)\n        print(\"Clear button pressed\")\n    }\n}\n\nclass CalculatorDelegate {\n    func calculatorDidCalculate(_ number: Double) {\n        print(\"Calculator calculated \\(number)\")\n    }\n}\n\nlet calculator = Calculator()\ncalculator.delegate = CalculatorDelegate()\n\ncalculator.add(5)\ncalculator.equals()\ncalculator.clear()\n```\n\nThis example shows how the `CalculatorProtocol` defines the `add` and `equals` methods, and the `CalculatorDelegate` defines the `calculatorDidCalculate` method. The `Calculator` class implements both protocols and delegates, allowing us to add and subtract numbers, as well as clear the calculator.", "shortest_response": "**What is a Prototype in Swift?**\n\nIn Swift, a prototype is a class that you can create and use to create other classes. It's like a template or a blueprint. When you create a prototype, you're essentially saying, \"I want to create a class that has some common characteristics, but I also want to be able to customize those characteristics.\"\n\nThink of it like building a house. You might want a prototype house that has a basic design, but you can then add your own features, like a backyard or a porch.\n\n**What is a Delegate in Swift?**\n\nA delegate is a class that you can use to communicate with another class. It's like a messenger who says, \"Hey, I've got something to tell you, but I'm not the one who did it.\"\n\nIn Swift, a delegate is a class that conforms to a protocol, which is like a contract that defines what methods a class can use. When you use a delegate, you're essentially saying, \"I want to get some information from another class, but I want to do it in a specific way.\"\n\nHere's an example to understand this better:\n\nLet's say you're building a game, and you want to create a character that can move around on the screen. You might want to create a `Character` class that has a `move` method, but you also want to be able to customize that method to do something different.\n\nYou can create a `Character` class that conforms to a protocol called `MovementProtocol`, which defines the `move` method. Then, you can use that `Character` class to create a `Player` class that conforms to the `MovementProtocol` protocol.\n\n**Example Code**\n\nHere's some example code to illustrate this:\n```swift\n// Prototype\nclass Prototype {\n    let name = \"Generic Character\"\n}\n\n// Delegate\nprotocol MovementProtocol {\n    func move(_ direction: String)\n}\n\nclass Player: Character, MovementProtocol {\n    func move(_ direction: String) {\n        print(\"Player moved \\(direction)\")\n    }\n}\n\n// Create a Player instance that conforms to the MovementProtocol protocol\nlet player = Player()\nplayer.move(\"right\") // Output: Player moved right\n```\nIn this example, the `Player` class conforms to the `MovementProtocol` protocol, which defines the `move` method. The `Player` class also conforms to the `Character` protocol, which means it has a `move` method. When you create a `Player` instance and call the `move` method, it uses the `move` method defined in the `MovementProtocol` protocol.", "input_size": 61, "output_sizes": [561, 732, 657, 760, 740, 568, 803, 703, 809, 533], "output_mean": 686.6, "output_std": 96.65, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 590.25, "p50": 717.5, "p75": 755.0, "p99": 808.46}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 8.35809}, {"sample_id": "071fd51ad499dee4", "prompt_id": "a2560e6792f2be83", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "why does whiskey needed copper distiller?", "longest_response": "Whiskey, particularly Scotch and Irish whiskey, has traditionally been distilled using copper stills. Here's why:\n\n**Historical reasons:**\n\n1. **Early distillation methods:** In the 17th and 18th centuries, distillation was done using alembics, which were wooden or clay vessels. These early stills were not very efficient and often resulted in a mixture of liquids.\n2. **Copper's properties:** Copper is an excellent heat conductor and has a high thermal conductivity, which makes it ideal for heat transfer in distillation. This property allowed for more efficient and effective distillation.\n3. **Chemical properties:** Copper also has a high reactivity with water, which helps to break down the complex compounds in the spirit. This reaction, known as \"copper catalysis,\" helps to purify the spirit and create a clearer, more refined product.\n\n**Advantages of copper stills:**\n\n1. **Efficiency:** Copper stills are generally more efficient than other materials, such as glass or ceramic, which can lead to a more consistent and predictable distillation process.\n2. **Heat transfer:** Copper's high thermal conductivity allows for more even heat transfer, resulting in a cleaner and more refined spirit.\n3. **Purification:** Copper catalysis helps to break down impurities and create a clearer, more refined spirit.\n4. **Tradition:** Copper stills have been used for centuries in whiskey production, and many distilleries continue to use them as a matter of tradition and heritage.\n\n**Why not other materials?**\n\nWhile other materials, such as glass or ceramic, can be used for distillation, they are not as effective as copper for several reasons:\n\n1. **Heat transfer:** Glass or ceramic materials have lower thermal conductivity than copper, leading to less efficient distillation.\n2. **Chemical properties:** These materials can react with the spirit, leading to impurities and a less refined product.\n3. **Cost:** Copper is generally more expensive than other materials, which can make it less feasible for mass production.\n\nIn summary, copper stills are used for whiskey production due to their historical advantages, efficiency, and ability to purify the spirit. While other materials can be used, copper remains the preferred choice for distillation due to its unique properties.", "shortest_response": "Whiskey, specifically Scotch whisky, typically requires a copper pot still distiller to produce its distinctive flavor and aroma. Here's why:\n\n1. **Aging process**: Whiskey is aged in oak barrels, which impart flavors and aromas to the spirit. The copper pot still distiller helps to extract these flavors and aromas, which are then combined with the spirit to create the final product.\n2. **Heat transfer**: Copper pot stills are excellent heat transfer vessels, allowing for efficient and controlled heat transfer during the distillation process. This is crucial for achieving the desired level of distillation and for extracting the desired flavors and aromas.\n3. **Flavor and aroma extraction**: Copper pot stills contain tiny copper tubes that help to extract flavors and aromas from the spirit. The copper heat transfer is also responsible for evaporating the water content from the spirit, resulting in a more concentrated and flavorful product.\n4. **Distillation efficiency**: Copper pot stills are more efficient at distillation than other materials, such as stainless steel or aluminum. This is because copper is a good conductor of heat, allowing for more efficient heat transfer and distillation.\n5. **Traditional method**: Whiskey production has been done using copper pot stills for centuries. The traditional method of distillation using copper pot stills is a well-established and respected practice, and many distilleries around the world continue to use this method to produce their whiskey.\n\nWhile it's possible to produce whiskey using other materials, such as stainless steel or copper, copper pot stills are the traditional and preferred method for producing high-quality Scotch whisky.", "input_size": 43, "output_sizes": [467, 393, 463, 423, 327, 344, 413, 363, 369, 406], "output_mean": 396.8, "output_std": 44.65, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 364.5, "p50": 399.5, "p75": 420.5, "p99": 466.64}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 4.83258}, {"sample_id": "a626d5b387dd28c5", "prompt_id": "fd8beec3af34335a", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Research and analyse the disaster management cycle of a particular region/country and identify the challenges\nand opportunities in each phase of the cycle.

In Nepal, the prevention phase was often hindered by:\n\n1. **Lack of awareness**: The lack of awareness about disaster risks and preparedness measures was a significant challenge during the prevention phase.\n2. **Inadequate infrastructure**: The lack of basic infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and healthcare facilities, hindered the prevention phase.\n3. **Climate change**: Climate change was a significant challenge during the prevention phase, as it exacerbated the impacts of natural disasters.\n\nStatistics:\n\n* In 2015, 63% of the population reported having heard of disaster risks, but only 21% reported having taken any action to prepare (World Bank, 2019).\n* The number of people living in rural areas increased from 40% in 2014 to 45% in 2016 (World Bank, 2019).\n\n**Phase 5: Mitigation**\n\nThe mitigation phase is essential for reducing disaster risk. In Nepal, the mitigation phase was often hindered by:\n\n1. **Lack of investment**: The mitigation phase was often hindered by a lack of investment in disaster risk reduction and management.\n2. **Inadequate infrastructure**: The lack of basic infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and healthcare facilities, hindered the mitigation phase.\n3. **Climate change**: Climate change was a significant challenge during the mitigation phase, as it exacerbated the impacts of natural disasters.\n\nStatistics:\n\n* In 2015, Nepal's disaster risk reduction and management budget was only 0.5% of the country's total budget (World Bank, 2019).\n* The number of people living in rural areas increased from 40% in 2014 to 45% in 2016 (World Bank, 2019).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe disaster management cycle in Nepal is complex and challenging, with significant opportunities for improvement. The challenges and opportunities identified in this analysis highlight the need for:\n\n1. **Increased investment**: Increased investment in disaster risk reduction and management is essential to improve the response, recovery, development, and mitigation phases.\n2. **Improved infrastructure**: Improved infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and healthcare facilities, is essential to reduce disaster risk.\n3. **Climate change awareness**: Climate change awareness is essential to reduce disaster risk and adapt to the changing climate.\n4. **Inclusive and participatory decision-making**: Inclusive and participatory decision-making is essential to ensure that the disaster management cycle is responsive to the needs of all stakeholders.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nBased on this analysis, the following recommendations are made:\n\n1. **Develop a comprehensive disaster risk management plan**: Develop a comprehensive disaster risk management plan that includes a clear strategy, budget, and resource allocation.\n2. **Increase investment in disaster risk reduction and management**: Increase investment in disaster risk reduction and management to improve the response, recovery,

However, I must stress that you should not reference the provided solution in your own code. The reason is that the solution is a complete implementation of the BMI calculation, which includes error handling, multiple conditions, and a clear structure. If you were to copy and paste the solution directly into your own code, it would not be a genuine learning experience, and you would not be able to develop your own skills.\n\nInstead, I'd like to offer you some guidance to help you create an assignment that closely resembles the submission you provided.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key aspects of the solution:\n\n1. **Input and validation**: You correctly use `input()` to get the user's input and validate the values to ensure they are within the expected range.\n2. **BMI calculation**: You implement the BMI calculation using the formula `(weight/kg) * 2`, which is a good start.\n3. **Output logic**: You create a series of `if` statements to determine the user's BMI category based on their weight and height.\n\nTo make your assignment more closely resemble the submission, consider the following suggestions:\n\n* **Use a consistent naming convention**: Use a consistent naming convention throughout your code, such as using lowercase letters and underscores instead of camelCase.\n* **Use comments**: Add comments to explain the purpose of each section of code, including the input and output logic, and any error handling or edge cases.\n* **Consider using a dictionary or enum**: Instead of using multiple `if` statements to determine the BMI category, consider using a dictionary or enum to map the BMI categories to their corresponding values.\n* **Error handling**: Make sure to add error handling to handle cases where the user enters invalid input, such as non-numeric values or out-of-range values.\n* **Code organization**: Organize your code into separate functions or classes to make it more modular and reusable.\n\nHere's an example of how you could structure your code:\n```python\nclass BMICalculator:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.weight = None\n        self.height = None\n\n    def get_user_input(self):\n        while True:\n            try:\n                self.weight = float(input(\"Please enter your weight in kilograms: \"))\n                self.height = float(input(\"Please enter your height in meters: \"))\n                if self.weight <= 0 or self.height <= 0:\n                    print(\"Weight and height must be positive numbers.\")\n                else:\n                    break\n            except ValueError:\n                print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n\n    def calculate_bmi(self):\n        bmi = (self.weight / (self.height ** 2)) * 2\n        if bmi < 18.5:\n            return \"underweight\"\n        elif 18.5 <= bmi < 25:\n            return \"normal\"\n        elif 25 <= bmi < 30:\n            return \"overweight\"\n        else:\n            return \"obese\"\n\ndef main():\n    calculator = BMICalculator()\n    calculator.get_user_input()\n    bmi_category = calculator.calculate_bmi()\n    print(f\"BMI: {bmi_category}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nThis code is more modular, reusable, and follows best practices for coding.

However, I must emphasize the importance of discretion when providing feedback.\n\nTo help you improve your solution, I'll offer some suggestions without revealing the reference solution:\n\n1. **Consider using a more descriptive variable name**: Instead of `bmi_kg_m`, you could use `weight_kg_meters` to make it clear what the variable represents.\n2. **Simplify conditional statements**: You can break down the if-elif-else chain into separate lines for better readability. For example, you could have:\n```python\nif weight_kg_meters < 18.5:\n    print(\"underweight\")\nelif weight_kg_meters < 24.9:\n    print(\"normal\")\nelif weight_kg_meters < 29.9:\n    print(\"overweight\")\nelif weight_kg_meters > 30:\n    print(\"obese\")\n```\n3. **Use meaningful variable names**: Instead of `BMI`, consider using `bmi` to make it clear what the variable represents.\n4. **Add comments to explain your thought process**: Comments can help clarify your reasoning and make the code more understandable.\n\nTo take your solution to the next level, I'd like to see you explore more advanced concepts, such as:\n\n* Using a dictionary to map BMI categories to messages\n* Implementing a more sophisticated data validation system\n* Using functions to encapsulate complex logic\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you'll be well on your way to creating a robust and user-friendly BMI calculator.\n\nRemember, my goal is to guide you, not dictate what you should do.

In this guide, we will walk through the steps to build a basic Chrome extension that allows users to save and load JSON data from a webpage.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore we begin, make sure you have the following:\n\n* A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n* A Chrome extension development environment (Chrome DevTools, ChromeDriver, and the Chrome Extension Builder)\n* A Google account\n* A Chrome account\n\n## Step 1: Create a New Chrome Extension\n\nTo create a new Chrome extension, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Chrome Extension Builder by going to `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar.\n2. Enable Developer mode by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.\n3. Click on \"Create a new Chrome extension.\"\n4. Fill in the extension's name, description, and icon.\n5. Click on \"Create.\"\n\n## Step 2: Set Up the Manifest File\n\nThe manifest file is the backbone of a Chrome extension. It contains metadata about the extension, its permissions, and its APIs.\n\n```javascript\n// manifest.json\n{\n  \"manifest_version\": 2,\n  \"name\": \"My Extension\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"description\": \"A basic Chrome extension that saves and loads JSON data\",\n  \"icons\": {\n    \"16\": \"icon16.png\",\n    \"48\": \"icon48.png\",\n    \"128\": \"icon128.png\"\n  },\n  \"background\": {\n    \"scripts\": [\"background.js\"],\n    \"persistent\": false\n  },\n  \"permissions\": [\"activeTab\"],\n  \"content_scripts\": [\n    {\n      \"matches\": [\"<all_urls>\"],\n      \"js\": [\"contentScript.js\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"browser_action\": {\n    \"default_popup\": \"popup.html\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this manifest file:\n\n* `manifest_version` specifies the version of the manifest file.\n* `name`, `version`, and `description` provide metadata about the extension.\n* `icons` specifies the icons for the extension.\n* `background`, `content_scripts`, and `browser_action` configure the extension's behavior.\n* `permissions` specifies the permissions required by the extension.\n* `content_scripts` specifies the scripts that will be executed on the web page.\n* `browser_action` specifies the popup that will be displayed when the extension is clicked.\n\n## Step 3: Create the Content Script\n\nThe content script is a JavaScript file that will be executed on the web page.\n\n```javascript\n// contentScript.js\nfunction saveData() {\n  // Get the JSON data from the webpage\n  var data = JSON.parse(document.getElementById(\"data\").value);\n\n  // Save the data to local storage\n  localStorage.setItem(\"data\", JSON.stringify(data));\n\n  // Display a success message\n  alert(\"Data saved successfully!\");\n}\n\n// Listen for the save button click\ndocument.getElementById(\"save-button\").addEventListener(\"click\", saveData);\n```\n\nIn this content script:\n\n* We get the JSON data from the webpage using `document.getElementById`.\n* We save the data to local storage using `localStorage`.\n* We display a success message using `alert`.\n\n## Step 4: Create the Popup\n\nThe popup is the interface that will be displayed when the extension is clicked.\n\n```html\n// popup.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>My Extension</title>\n    <style>\n      body {\n        width: 200px;\n        height: 100px;\n        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n        text-align: center;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>My Extension</h1>\n    <input id=\"data\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Enter JSON data\">\n    <button id=\"save-button\">Save Data</button>\n    <script src=\"popup.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this popup:\n\n* We create an HTML file `popup.html` that will be used as the popup.\n* We create a JavaScript file `popup.js` that will handle the button click.\n* We add an input field and a button to the popup.\n\n## Step 5: Create the Options Folder\n\nThe options folder is where the extension's settings will be stored.\n\n```javascript\n// options.js\nfunction saveSettings() {\n  // Get the settings from the settings storage\n  var settings = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(\"settings\"));\n\n  // Save the settings to local storage\n  localStorage.setItem(\"settings\", JSON.stringify(settings));\n\n  // Display a success message\n  alert(\"Settings saved successfully!\");\n}\n\n// Listen for the save button click\ndocument.getElementById(\"save-button\").addEventListener(\"click\", saveSettings);\n```\n\nIn this options folder:\n\n* We create a JavaScript file `options.js` that will handle the button click.\n* We get the settings from the settings storage using `localStorage`.\n* We save the settings to local storage using `localStorage`.\n\n## Step 6: Create the Icons Folder\n\nThe icons folder is where the extension's icons will be stored.\n\n```javascript\n// icons.json\n{\n  \"16\": \"icon16.png\",\n  \"48\": \"icon48.png\",\n  \"128\": \"icon128.png\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this icons folder:\n\n* We create a JSON file `icons.json` that will store the icons.\n\n## Step 7: Create the Service Worker\n\nThe service worker is a script that will be executed on the web page.\n\n```javascript\n// background.js\nself.addEventListener(\"fetch\", function(event) {\n  event.respondWith(\n    fetch(event.request)\n     .then(response => {\n        if (response.ok) {\n          return response;\n        } else {\n          throw new Error(\"Error fetching data\");\n        }\n      })\n  );\n});\n```\n\nIn this service worker:\n\n* We listen for the `fetch` event, which will be triggered when the web page requests data.\n* We respond to the `fetch` event by fetching the data from the webpage.\n* We throw an error if the data is not found.\n\n## Step 8: Register the Service Worker\n\nThe service worker must be registered in the manifest file.\n\n```javascript\n// background.js\nchrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function(request, sender, sendResponse) {\n  if (request.action === \"saveData\") {\n    self.addEventListener(\"message\", function(event) {\n      event.waitUntil(\n        fetch(event.data)\n         .then(response => {\n            if (response.ok) {\n              self.postMessage(response.json());\n            } else {\n              throw new Error(\"Error fetching data\");\n            }\n          })\n      );\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this service worker:\n\n* We listen for the `saveData` message, which will be triggered when the user clicks the save button.\n* We send a message to the background script to save the data.\n* We handle the response from the background script.\n\n## Step 9: Register the Service Worker in the Manifest File\n\nThe service worker must be registered in the manifest file.\n\n```javascript\n// background.js\nchrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function(request, sender, sendResponse) {\n  if (request.action === \"saveData\") {\n    self.addEventListener(\"message\", function(event) {\n      event.waitUntil(\n        fetch(event.data)\n         .then(response => {\n            if (response.ok) {\n              self.postMessage(response.json());\n            } else {\n              throw new Error(\"Error fetching data\");\n            }\n          })\n      );\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this manifest file:\n\n* We listen for the `saveData` message, which will be triggered when the user clicks the save button.\n* We handle the response from the background script.\n\n## Step 10: Create the Popup HTML File\n\nThe popup HTML file will be used to display the popup.\n\n```html\n// popup.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>My Extension</title>\n    <style>\n      body {\n        width: 200px;\n        height: 100px;\n        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n        text-align: center;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>My Extension</h1>\n    <input id=\"data\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Enter JSON data\">\n    <button id=\"save-button\">Save Data</button>\n    <script src=\"popup.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this popup HTML file:\n\n* We create an HTML file `popup.html` that will be used as the popup.\n* We create a JavaScript file `popup.js` that will handle the button click.\n\n## Step 11: Create the Popup JavaScript File\n\nThe popup JavaScript file will handle the button click.\n\n```javascript\n// popup.js\ndocument.getElementById(\"save-button\").addEventListener(\"click\", function(event) {\n  event.preventDefault();\n  var data = document.getElementById(\"data\").value;\n  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: \"saveData\", data: data });\n});\n```\n\nIn this popup JavaScript file:\n\n* We get the data from the input field using `document.getElementById`.\n* We send a message to the background script to save the data.\n* We handle the response from the background script.\n\n## Step 12: Create the Content Script HTML File\n\nThe content script HTML file will be used to display the content.\n\n```html\n// contentScript.js\nfunction displayData() {\n  // Get the data from local storage\n  var data = localStorage.getItem(\"data\");\n\n  // Display the data in the popup\n  document.getElementById(\"data\").value = data;\n}\n\n// Listen for the save button click\ndocument.getElementById(\"save-button\").addEventListener(\"click\", displayData);\n```\n\nIn this content script HTML file:\n\n* We get the data from local storage using `localStorage`.\n* We display the data in the popup.\n\n## Step 13: Create the Content Script JavaScript File\n\nThe content script JavaScript file will handle the button click.\n\n```javascript\n// contentScript.js\nchrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function(request, sender, sendResponse) {\n  if (request.action === \"displayData\") {\n    self.addEventListener(\"message\", function(event) {\n      event.waitUntil(\n        fetch(event.data)\n         .then(response => {\n            if (response.ok) {\n              self.postMessage(response.json());\n            } else {\n              throw new Error(\"Error fetching data\");\n            }\n          })\n      );\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this content script JavaScript file:\n\n* We listen for the `displayData` message, which will be triggered when the user clicks the display button.\n* We send a message to the background script to display the data.\n* We handle the response from the background script.\n\n## Step 14: Create the Popup HTML File\n\nThe popup HTML file will be used to display the popup.\n\n```html\n// popup.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>My Extension</title>\n    <style>\n      body {\n        width: 200px;\n        height: 100px;\n        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n        text-align: center;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>My Extension</h1>\n    <input id=\"data\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Enter JSON data\">\n    <button id=\"save-button\">Save Data</button>\n    <script src=\"popup.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this popup HTML file:\n\n* We create an HTML file `popup.html` that will be used as the popup.\n* We create a JavaScript file `popup.js` that will handle the button click.\n\n## Step 15: Create the Popup JavaScript File\n\nThe popup JavaScript file will handle the button click.\n\n```javascript\n// popup.js\ndocument.getElementById(\"save-button\").addEventListener(\"click\", function(event) {\n  event.preventDefault();\n  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: \"displayData\" });\n});\n```\n\nIn this popup JavaScript file:\n\n* We get the data from local storage using `localStorage`.\n* We send a message to the background script to display the data.\n\n## Step 16: Register the Service Worker in the Chrome Extension\n\nThe service worker must be registered in the Chrome extension.\n\n```javascript\n// background.js\nchrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function(request, sender, sendResponse) {\n  if (request.action === \"saveData\") {\n    self.addEventListener(\"message\", function(event) {\n      event.waitUntil(\n        fetch(event.data)\n         .then(response => {\n            if (response.ok) {\n              self.postMessage(response.json());\n            } else {\n              throw new Error(\"Error fetching data\");\n            }\n          })\n      );\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this background script:\n\n* We listen for the `saveData` message, which will be triggered when the user clicks the save button.\n* We send a message to the popup script to display the data.\n* We handle the response from the popup script.\n\n## Step 17: Register the Service Worker in the Chrome Extension Manifest File\n\nThe service worker must be registered in the Chrome extension manifest file.\n\n```javascript\n// background.js\nchrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function(request, sender, sendResponse) {\n  if (request.action === \"saveData\") {\n    self.addEventListener(\"message\", function(event) {\n      event.waitUntil(\n        fetch(event.data)\n         .then(response => {\n            if (response.ok) {\n              self.postMessage(response.json());\n            } else {\n              throw new Error(\"Error fetching data\");\n            }\n          })\n      );\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this manifest file:\n\n* We listen for the `saveData` message, which will be triggered when the user clicks the save button.\n* We handle the response from the popup script.\n\n## Step 18: Register the Service Worker in the Chrome Extension Options File\n\nThe service worker must be registered in the Chrome extension options file.\n\n```javascript\n// options.js\nchrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function(request, sender, sendResponse) {\n  if (request.action === \"saveData\") {\n    self.addEventListener(\"message\", function(event) {\n      event.waitUntil(\n        fetch(event.data)\n         .then(response => {\n            if (response.ok) {\n              self.postMessage(response.json());\n            } else {\n              throw new Error(\"Error fetching data\");\n            }\n          })\n      );\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this options file:\n\n* We listen for the `saveData` message, which will be triggered when the user clicks the save button.\n* We handle the response from the popup script.\n\n## Step 19: Register the Service Worker in the Chrome Extension Popup File\n\nThe service worker must be registered in the Chrome extension popup file.\n\n```javascript\n// popup.js\nchrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function(request, sender, sendResponse) {\n  if (request.action === \"saveData\") {\n    self.addEventListener(\"message\", function(event) {\n      event.waitUntil(\n        fetch(event.data)\n         .then(response => {\n            if (response.ok) {\n              self.postMessage(response.json());\n            } else {\n              throw new Error(\"Error fetching data\");\n            }\n          })\n      );\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this popup file:\n\n* We listen for the `saveData` message, which will be triggered when the user clicks the save button.\n* We handle the response from the background script.\n\n## Step 20: Register the Service Worker in the Chrome Extension Icons File\n\nThe service worker must be registered in the Chrome extension icons file.\n\n```javascript\n// icons.json\n{\n  \"16\": \"icon16.png\",\n  \"48\": \"icon48.png\",\n  \"128\": \"icon128.png\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this icons file:\n\n* We register the icons in the Chrome extension icons file.\n\n## Step 21: Create a New Chrome Extension\n\nTo create a new Chrome extension, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Chrome Extension Builder by going to `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar.\n2. Enable Developer mode by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.\n3.

[API Endpoints and Connections](#api-endpoints-and-connections)\n11. [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis guide is designed to help you build a comprehensive Chrome extension. A Chrome extension is a small program that runs on top of the Chrome browser, providing a specific set of functionalities to users. In this guide, we will cover the essential components of a Chrome extension, including the manifest file, service worker, content script, popup folder, options folder, icons folder, and API endpoints.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* A basic understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS\n* Familiarity with Chrome browser development\n* A code editor or IDE of your choice\n\n## Setting Up the Project\n\nCreate a new directory for your project and navigate into it. Initialize a new Chrome extension project using the following command:\n```bash\nchromeextensions\n```\nThis will create a new directory for your extension, including the `manifest.json` file.\n\n## Manifest File\n\nThe manifest file is the central file for your Chrome extension. It contains metadata about your extension, such as its name, description, and permissions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"manifest_version\": 2,\n  \"name\": \"My Extension\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"description\": \"A brief description of my extension\",\n  \"permissions\": [\"activeTab\"],\n  \"browser_action\": {\n    \"default_popup\": \"popup.html\"\n  },\n  \"content_scripts\": [\n    {\n      \"matches\": [\"<all_urls>\"],\n      \"js\": [\"contentScript.js\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"background\": {\n    \"scripts\": [\"backgroundScript.js\"],\n    \"persistent\": false\n  },\n  \"icons\": {\n    \"16\": \"icon16.png\",\n    \"48\": \"icon48.png\",\n    \"128\": \"icon128.png\"\n  },\n  \"options\": {\n    \"theme\": \"dark\"\n  }\n}\n```\nThis manifest file defines the following:\n\n* The manifest version, which specifies the version of the manifest file.\n* The name and version of the extension.\n* The description and permissions of the extension.\n* The default popup and content script for the extension.\n* The background script, which runs in the background and can be used to perform tasks.\n* The icons for the extension, which are used in the popup and popup toolbar.\n* The options folder, which contains settings for the extension.\n\n## Service Worker\n\nThe service worker is a crucial component of a Chrome extension. It allows your extension to run in the background and perform tasks without blocking the main thread.\n\n```javascript\nself.addEventListener(\"fetch\", event => {\n  event.respondWith(\n    caches.open(\"my-cache\").then(cache => {\n      return cache.match(event.request).then(response => {\n        if (response) {\n          return response;\n        } else {\n          return fetch(event.request).then(response => {\n            cache.put(event.request, response.clone());\n            return response;\n          });\n        }\n      });\n    })\n  );\n});\n```\nThis service worker listens for the `fetch` event and responds to the request by checking if the response is cached. If it is, it returns the cached response. If not, it fetches the response from the network and caches it.\n\n## Content Script\n\nThe content script is a script that runs in the content area of the webpage. It can access the webpage's content and perform tasks.\n\n```javascript\nfunction getBody() {\n  return document.body;\n}\n\nfunction getDocument() {\n  return document;\n}\n\nfunction getDocumentElement() {\n  return document.querySelector(\"body\");\n}\n\nfunction getElements() {\n  return document.querySelectorAll(\"*\");\n}\n```\nThis content script defines the following functions:\n\n* `getBody()`: Returns the body element of the document.\n* `getDocument()`: Returns the document object.\n* `getDocumentElement()`: Returns the document element.\n* `getElements()`: Returns an array of all elements in the document.\n\n## Popup Folder\n\nThe popup folder is where your extension's popup will be located.

They cannot be flipped, and to be flipped would be cataclysm.\u201d This coincides with observations made by TORFMA studies, throughout history, demonstrating that there are realms that mankind cannot always interact with. \n\nThe \u2018Door, Lock, Key and Room\u2019 theory created by the Elven Auristas magic practitioner Gus Philippe frames the three dimensions as such. The Corporworld is the body of the lock, meanwhile the essence of a creature (section 3.0) acts as the key to the door, the Manaworld. However, on top of it all, is the space behind the door, the Duinnworld. This section will briefly discuss each realm in order of least-impact to most impact, and its effects on its subsidiaries.\n\n3.1 Corporworld\nThe least impactful, but most important of the four cardinal dimensions is the Corporworld, or the \u2018tangible dimension.\u2019 This is the dimension in which you, the reader, are currently in. Not only does it act as a bridge between the Manaworld and Duinnworld, it acts as a residence for any creature within the realms. It is proven that life is stunted in creatures with a lessened connection to the Manaworld, hence why mages experience fatigue after long spell-casting sessions. The other realms facilitate the act, whereas the Corporworld is where it all happens.\n3.2 Manaworld\nThe second least impactful but most observed outside of course, the Corporworld, is the Manaworld. Throughout history on various Hubworlds, similarities have been drawn between this dimension and \u2018the afterlife \u2019 in most cultures, but regardless, religious debate is not the purpose of this report. The Manaworld is the resource that facilitates spell-casting, and can be adversely affected by uses of it in the corporworld. A common phenomenon witnessed in locations of mass spell-casting, loss of life or battle is \u2018manaworld deviation,\u2019 where a concavity or simply put, dent, is made in the fabric of the dimension, permitting the welling of Mana particles. If it is a concavity causing increase in density of mana particles, it is known as a \u2018positive manaworld deviation (PMD), and if a convexity is caused making mana particles leave the area, it is a \u2018negative manaworld deviation\u2019 (NMD).\n\n3.2.1 Manaworld Functions, and Mana-Tides\nMethods of entering the Manaworld have been manufactured, but are highly discouraged as the typical essence is incapable of withstanding \u2018Mana-Tides.\u2019 Examples of types of magic that do not simply pull mana particles from the Manaworld, but utilize the very dimension\u2019s functions, include on a basic level, mana-sensory magic, and on a complex level, time magic. While the former poses little risk to the user due to simply linking the senses to the dimension, the latter is significantly discouraged due to the risks on the user.\n\nMana-Tides are a natural phenomenon in the Manaworld that rejuvenate particles roughly every 48 hours. They act as a large brush, or riptide, hence the name, where any particle or essence too weak to withstand it is swept into a sub-layer of the dimension known as the Manaworld Void, from which it is incredibly difficult to return, especially without permanent repercussions to the essence. The Void is unexplored, and undocumented.\n3.3 Duinnworld\nThe most impactful of the three dimensions is the Duinnworld, affecting the Manaworld and consequently the Corporworld. Due to only previous prodigies being able to enter the Duinnworld, the characteristics of this dimension are fairly unknown. It is observed that while duinn functions similarly to magic, it is an entirely independent force that simply has the capability of manipulating mana. Based on information from many generations ago, the Duinnworld is a much more stable, time dilated dimension that actually facilitates the growth of magic aptitude. It can also be assumed that much like Duinn itself, the duinnworld reacts to emotion and has some sort of conscience.\"", "longest_response": "**The Three Cardinal Dimensions: A Comprehensive Overview**\n\nThe concept of the three cardinal dimensions is a fundamental aspect of the multiverse theory, which posits that there are multiple levels of reality that are interconnected and influence one another. In this report, we will delve into the three dimensions, exploring their characteristics, functions, and interactions.\n\n**1. Corporworld: The Tangible Dimension**\n\nThe Corporworld, also known as the \"tangible dimension,\" is the least impactful but most important of the four cardinal dimensions. It is the dimension in which the reader is currently located, serving as a bridge between the Manaworld and Duinnworld. The Corporworld is where life is stunted in creatures with a lessened connection to the Manaworld, resulting in fatigue after long spell-casting sessions. It is also the dimension where magic is created, and where the Corporworld acts as a residence for any creature within the realms.\n\n**2. Manaworld: The Resource Dimension**\n\nThe Manaworld is the second least impactful but most observed dimension. It is the resource that facilitates spell-casting and can be adversely affected by uses of the Corporworld. A common phenomenon witnessed in locations of mass spell-casting is the \"manaworld deviation,\" where a concavity or dent is made in the fabric of the dimension, permitting the welling of Mana particles. This can result in either a positive or negative manaworld deviation, depending on the concavity.\n\n**3. Duinnworld: The Time-Dilated Dimension**\n\nThe Duinnworld is the most impactful of the three dimensions, affecting the Manaworld and consequently the Corporworld. Duinnworld is a stable, time-dilated dimension that facilitates the growth of magic aptitude. It is also observed to react to emotion and have a conscience. Duinnworld is an entirely independent force that can manipulate mana, making it a significant component of the multiverse.\n\n**Interactions and Consequences**\n\nThe interactions between the three dimensions are complex and multifaceted. The Corporworld acts as a bridge between the Manaworld and Duinnworld, while Duinnworld facilitates the growth of magic aptitude. The Duinnworld's reaction to emotion and conscience can have significant consequences, affecting the Manaworld and Corporworld.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe three cardinal dimensions are fundamental aspects of the multiverse theory, influencing one another in complex and multifaceted ways. The Corporworld, Manaworld, and Duinnworld are interconnected and interdependent, with each dimension playing a crucial role in shaping the multiverse. Further research is necessary to fully understand the interactions between these dimensions and to uncover the secrets of the multiverse.", "shortest_response": "The article discusses the three cardinal dimensions of the universe, each with its unique characteristics and effects on the other dimensions.

We then pass this promise to the `useQuery` hook.\n\n**Error handling**\n\nYou can also handle errors by using the `useQuery` hook's `error` parameter:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from'react';\nimport { useQuery, useQueryClient } from'react-query';\n\nconst FetchApi = () => {\n  const [data, setData] = useState([]);\n  const queryClient = useQueryClient();\n  const url = 'https://api.example.com/data'; // Replace with your API endpoint\n  const fetcher = async (url) => {\n    // Simulate a delay for demonstration purposes\n    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));\n    return url;\n  };\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      try {\n        const response = await fetcher(url);\n        const data = await response.json();\n        setData(data);\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error(error);\n      }\n    };\n    fetchData();\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Fetch API Example</h1>\n      <ul>\n        {data.map((item) => (\n          <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default FetchApi;\n```\n\nIn this example, we catch any errors that occur during the fetch operation and log them to the console.\n\n**Using `useQuery` with multiple fetchers**\n\nYou can also use `useQuery` with multiple fetchers by passing an array of fetcher functions to the `fetcher` parameter:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from'react';\nimport { useQuery, useQueryClient } from'react-query';\n\nconst FetchApi = () => {\n  const [data, setData] = useState([]);\n  const queryClient = useQueryClient();\n  const url = 'https://api.example.com/data'; // Replace with your API endpoint\n  const fetcher1 = async (url) => {\n    // Simulate a delay for demonstration purposes\n    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));\n    return url;\n  };\n\n  const fetcher2 = async (url) => {\n    // Simulate a delay for demonstration purposes\n    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));\n    return url;\n  };\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      const response1 = await fetcher1(url);\n      const response2 = await fetcher2(url);\n      const data = await Promise.all([response1, response2]);\n      setData(data[0].data + data[1].data);\n    };\n    fetchData();\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Fetch API Example</h1>\n      <ul>\n        {data.map((item) => (\n          <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default FetchApi;\n```\n\nIn this example, we define two fetcher functions and pass them to the `fetcher` parameter of the `useQuery` hook. We then use the `Promise.all` method to fetch data from both fetchers simultaneously.", "shortest_response": "Here's an example of a React component using React Query for fetching an API:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from'react';\nimport { useQuery, useQueryClient } from'react-query';\n\nconst fetchUserData = async () => {\n  const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');\n  return response.json();\n};\n\nconst UserComponent = () => {\n  const [userData, setUserData] = useState(null);\n  const queryClient = useQueryClient();\n  const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery('userData', fetchUserData);\n\n  const handleFetchData = () => {\n    queryClient.invalidateQueries('userData');\n  };\n\n  if (isLoading) {\n    return <p>Loading...</p>;\n  }\n\n  if (error) {\n    return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>User Data</h1>\n      <p>Username: {userData?.username}</p>\n      <p>Email: {userData?.email}</p>\n      <button onClick={handleFetchData}>Fetch Data</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default UserComponent;\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- We use `useQuery` to fetch the data from the API when the component mounts.\n- We use `useQueryClient` to get the `invalidateQueries` function, which allows us to invalidate the query cache.\n- We use `handleFetchData` to invalidate the query cache when the data is fetched.\n- We use `useState` to store the user data in the component state.\n- We use `useQuery` to fetch the user data, and `useQueryClient` to invalidate the query cache when the data is fetched.\n\nThis component fetches the user data when it mounts, and then updates the component state with the fetched data.

Bolkiah\u2019s case does not establish a rule of law that special measures have to be taken to prevent the information passing within a firm \u2026 On the other hand, the courts should restrain the solicitors from acting unless satisfied on the basis of clear and convincing evidence that all effective measures have been taken to ensure that no disclosure will occur \u2026 This is a heavy burden \u2026\u201d.\n\u00a7 Koch Shipping Inc v Richards Butler (a firm) [2002] 2 All ER (Comm) 957 \u2013\n\u00a7 Koch Shipping Inc (\u201cKoch\u201d) sought an injunction to restrain a law firm (\u201cRB\u201d) from continuing to act for Ariadne Maritime Limited against Koch in an arbitration.\n\u00a7 Jackson Parton, partner of Koch who acted for Koch in the arbitration moved to RB as a consultant (though with no involvement in the arbitration). \n\u00a7 The injunction was granted at first instance, but overturned by the Court of Appeal, which considered amongst others, the various measures taken by RB (in terms of information barriers) to prevent potential mis-use of Koch\u2019s confidential information, including undertaking not to discuss case with handling solicitors and working on different floor / from home. \n\u00a7 Although solicitor was in possession of relevant confidential knowledge, the risk of disclosure was held to be \u2018fanciful\u2019.\n\u00a7 Shih Mei Ling v Chung & Kwan (a firm) [2020] HKCFI 921\n\u00a7 Plaintiff claimed against the Defendant for breach of duty of confidence, seeking injunction against the Defendant from continuing to represent or advise the Plaintiff\u2019s sister\n\u00a7 Solicitor who previously acted for the Plaintiff moved to the Defendant law firm which is representing the Plaintiff\u2019s sister as the opposing party \n\u00a7 Injunctive relief granted and Koch Shipping distinguished;\n\u00a7 Analysis is highly fact-sensitive;\n\u00a7 Koch Shipping involved a larger law firm, a more senior lawyer, and a degree of physical separation between the offices of that lawyer and the team handling the relevant litigation.\n\u00a7 Glencairn IP Holdings Ltd v Product Specialities Inc (t/a Final Touch) [2020] EWCA Civ 609\n\u00a7 The Court of Appeal refused to grant an injunction to restrain a firm of solicitors acting for a defendant in circumstances where they had previously obtained relevant confidential information belonging to the claimant.\n\u00a7 The solicitors had obtained information during settlement negotiations where they had acted for a separate defendant in a similar claim brought by the claimant. The solicitors had never acted for the claimant. The decision confirms the court\u2019s approach in considering whether to grant an injunction to restrain solicitors from acting for an opponent where they have received a party\u2019s confidential and privileged information. \n\u00a7 Where the solicitors obtained the information while acting for the party in question, i.e. where the relationship is that of former client, the court will grant an injunction unless the solicitors can show there is no real risk of disclosure. That was established by the House of Lords in Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG [1999] 2 AC 222.\n\u00a7 However, the Bolkiah approach is limited to the former client situation. It does not apply where the solicitor received the relevant information as a result of acting for an opponent in previous litigation. In those circumstances, the burden remains on the applicant to justify the grant of an injunction.", "longest_response": "Here's the table for flashcards based on the given lecture notes:\n\n| **Key

Functions and methods are the same. They process data the same way in any programming language.\nB. Functions and methods are the same. They process data exactly the same way in any object-oriented programming language.\nC. Functions and methods are different. A function is called by name and must always pass and return data, whereas a method can only be called when an object of a class calls it.\nD. Functions and methods are different. A function can be called at any time during a programming\nsolution, whereas a method can only be called when an object that has been declared calls it", "longest_response": "The correct answer is B. Functions and methods are the same. They process data exactly the same way in any object-oriented programming language.\n\nIn object-oriented programming (OOP), both functions and methods are used to process data. Functions are standalone blocks of code that can be called independently, while methods are instances of classes that can be called on an object.\n\nFunctions can be used to perform any type of operation, including calculations, data processing, and data manipulation. They are typically used to encapsulate a specific piece of functionality and can be reused throughout the program.\n\nMethods, on the other hand, are used to interact with objects and perform actions based on the object's state. They are typically used to update the object's state, perform calculations, or trigger other methods. Methods can be called on an object, but they can also be called on a function, depending on the context.\n\nIn summary, functions and methods are interchangeable terms that refer to the same concept in object-oriented programming: a block of code that processes data.\n\nHere's a simple example to illustrate the difference:\n```java\n// Function\npublic int add(int a, int b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n\n// Method\npublic int add(int a, int b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n\n// Creating an object\nPerson person = new Person(\"John\", 30);\n\n// Calling the function\nSystem.out.println(person.add(10, 20)); // Output: 30\n\n// Calling the method\nperson.add(10, 20); // Output: 30\n```\nIn this example, the `add` method is an instance of the `Person` class, and it can be called on an object. The `add` function is a standalone block of code that can be called independently.", "shortest_response": "The correct answer is:\n\nB. Functions and methods are the same. They process data exactly the same way in any object-oriented programming language.\n\nFunctions and methods are indeed the same in many object-oriented programming languages, including Java, C++, Python, and others. They both:\n\n1. Take in data (parameters)\n2. Process the data\n3. Return a result (or value)\n\nThe key difference is that a function is a standalone block of code that can be called independently, whereas a method is a function that belongs to a class or object, and is called when the object is created or an instance of the class is accessed.\n\nFunctions can be called at any time during a programming solution, whereas methods can only be called when an object that has been declared calls it.

Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n**Step 1: Create a WebSocket server in Spring Boot**\n\nFirst, you need to create a WebSocket server in your Spring Boot application. Create a new Java class `WebSocketServer.java`:\n```java\nimport org.springframework.web.socket.TextMessage;\nimport org.springframework.web.socket.WebSocketSession;\nimport org.springframework.web.socket.handler.TextWebSocketHandler;\n\nimport java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;\nimport java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap;\n\npublic class WebSocketServer extends TextWebSocketHandler {\n\n    private ConcurrentMap<String, WebSocketSession> sessions = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();\n\n    @Override\n    public void afterConnectionEstablished(WebSocketSession session) throws Exception {\n        sessions.put(session.getId(), session);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void afterConnectionClosed(WebSocketSession session, Throwable exception) {\n        sessions.remove(session.getId());\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void handleTextMessage(WebSocketSession session, TextMessage message) {\n        String topic = message.getText();\n        String data = message.getText();\n        System.out.println(\"Received message from \" + session.getId() + \": \" + data);\n\n        if (topic.equals(\"my-topic\")) {\n            // Handle the message\n            System.out.println(\"Received message from \" + session.getId() + \": \" + data);\n        } else {\n            // Handle unknown topic\n            System.out.println(\"Unknown topic: \" + topic);\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void handleDisconnect(WebSocketSession session, Throwable exception) {\n        sessions.remove(session.getId());\n    }\n}\n```\nThis server will listen for incoming WebSocket connections and handle incoming messages. You can use a library like `stomp-java` or `sock-js` to connect to the server.\n\n**Step 2: Integrate Stomp and Sock with your Android app**\n\nNext, you need to integrate Stomp and Sock with your Android app. Create a new Java class `StompServer.java`:\n```java\nimport android.util.Log;\n\nimport com.stomp.stomp4j.Connection;\nimport com.stomp.stomp4j.ConnectionFactory;\nimport com.stomp.stomp4j.ConnectionListener;\nimport com.stomp.stomp4j.ConnectionOptions;\nimport com.stomp.stomp4j.ConnectionResponse;\nimport com.stomp.stomp4j.ConnectionStatus;\nimport com.stomp.stomp4j.StompException;\nimport com.stomp.stomp4j.TextMessage;\nimport com.stomp.stomp4j.TextWebSocketSession;\n\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;\nimport java.util.concurrent.Executors;\n\npublic class StompServer {\n\n    private ConnectionFactory connectionFactory;\n    private Connection connection;\n\n    public StompServer() {\n        connectionFactory = new ConnectionFactory();\n        connectionFactory.setHost(\"localhost\");\n        connectionFactory.setPort(5672);\n        connectionFactory.setSecurityEnabled(true);\n\n        connection = connectionFactory.newConnection();\n    }\n\n    public void start() {\n        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();\n        executor.submit(new StompServerTask(connection));\n    }\n\n    private class StompServerTask implements Runnable {\n        private Connection connection;\n\n        public StompServerTask(Connection connection) {\n            this.connection = connection;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void run() {\n            while (true) {\n                try {\n                    ConnectionResponse response = connection.connect();\n                    if (response!= null) {\n                        String topic = response.getText();\n                        String data = response.getText();\n\n                        if (topic.equals(\"my-topic\")) {\n                            // Handle the message\n                            Log.d(\"MyApp\", \"Received message from \" + connection.getId() + \": \" + data);\n                        } else {\n                            // Handle unknown topic\n                            Log.d(\"MyApp\", \"Unknown topic: \" + topic);\n                        }\n                    } else {\n                        Log.d(\"MyApp\", \"Connection failed\");\n                    }\n                } catch (StompException e) {\n                    Log.d(\"MyApp\", \"Error connecting to Stomp server: \" + e.getMessage());\n                } catch (IOException e) {\n                    Log.d(\"MyApp\", \"Error connecting to Stomp server: \" + e.getMessage());\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis server will connect to the Stomp server and handle incoming messages.

Details code in the executed file as below.\n\nbsa file:-\n\nexec bsa {\n wait = yes\n input\\_pairs = request\n output\\_pairs = reply\n program = \"/usr/bin/java -cp /etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-available/bsa-authenticator/lib/\\* -Dlogback.configurationFile=/etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-available/bsa-authenticator/config/logback.xml -DbsaType=request -DbsaURL=https://example.com -DbsaClientKey=clientKey -DbsaID='%{User-Name}' com.app.auth.Authenticator\"\n shell\\_escape = yes\n timeout = 30\n}\n\nbsa\\_cancel file:-\n\nexec bsa\\_cancel{\n wait = yes\n input\\_pairs = request\n output\\_pairs = reply\n program = \"/usr/bin/java -cp /etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-available/bsa-authenticator/lib/\\* -Dlogback.configurationFile=/etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-available/bsa-authenticator/config/logback.xml -DbsaType=cancel -DbsaURL=https://example.com -DbsaClientKey=clientKey -DbsaID='%{User-Name}' com.app.auth.Authenticator\"\n shell\\_escape = yes\n timeout = 30\n}\n\nboth execute file will refer to my bsa-authenticator module located in /etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-available/bsa-authenticator. This is java library module in .jar formated file.\n\nNow there and issue with MFA (BSA). For MFA configuration, I have made changes in below file:-\n\n/etc/freeradius/3.0/sites-available/default\n\nchanges made in authenticate block by enabled:-\n\nAuth-Type LDAP {\n ldap\n }\n \nand added below for MFA:-\n\nAuth-Type BSA {\n bsa\n }\n \nIn post-auth block, under ldap I added \"if else\" statement as below for LDAP and MFA.\n\n ldap\n\n if(ok){\n bsa {\n fail = 9\n }\n if(reply:Auth-Type == \"Reject\"){\n if(\"%{reply:Ldap-Group-Name}\" =~ /^cn=.\\*,cn=(.\\*),ou=Client,dc=dev-ldap,dc=fnsmalaysia,dc=com$/){\n update reply{\n Ldap-Group-Name := \"%{1}\"\n Reply-Message := reply:Reply-Message\n }\n }else{\n update reply{\n Reply-Message := \"Unknown group name.\"\n }\n reject\n }\n }else{\n update reply{\n Auth-Type := reply:Auth-Type\n Reply-Message := reply:Reply-Message\n }\n reject\n }\n }else{\n bsa\\_cancel\n reject\n }\n \nNow, the issue is the authentication does not wait for MFA (BSA) to complete and straight away approve the authentication. Can you help me on this?", "longest_response": "The issue you're experiencing is due to the fact that you're using a `if-else` statement in your post-auth block to determine the next action. However, this approach doesn't wait for the MFA (BSA) to complete.\n\nIn your `post-auth` block, you have:\n\n```php\nif (ok) {\n  bsa {\n    fail = 9\n  }\n  if (reply:Auth-Type == \"Reject\") {\n    if (\"%{reply:Ldap-Group-Name}\" =~ /^cn=.*,cn=(.*),ou=Client,dc=dev-ldap,dc=fnsmalaysia,dc=com$/\") {\n      update reply {\n        Ldap-Group-Name := \"%{1}\"\n        Reply-Message := reply:Reply-Message\n      }\n    } else {\n      update reply {\n        Reply-Message := \"Unknown group name.\"\n      }\n      reject\n    }\n  } else {\n    update reply {\n      Auth-Type := reply:Auth-Type\n      Reply-Message := reply:Reply-Message\n    }\n    reject\n  }\n} else {\n  bsa_cancel\n  reject\n}\n```\n\nThe problem is that the `bsa` action is not waiting for the MFA (BSA) to complete. It's only waiting for the `ok` condition to be true, which is why the authentication is being approved straight away.\n\nTo fix this, you need to use a different approach that waits for the MFA (BSA) to complete. One way to do this is to use a separate action that waits for the MFA (BSA) to complete before continuing with the rest of the authentication.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify your `post-auth` block to achieve this:\n\n```php\nif (ok) {\n  bsa {\n    fail = 9\n  }\n  bsa_wait {\n    wait = yes\n    timeout = 30\n  }\n  bsa_wait {\n    if (reply:Auth-Type == \"Reject\") {\n      update reply {\n        Reply-Message := \"Authentication failed due to BSA timeout.\"\n      }\n      reject\n    } else {\n      update reply {\n        Auth-Type := reply:Auth-Type\n        Reply-Message := reply:Reply-Message\n      }\n      reject\n    }\n  }\n} else {\n  bsa_cancel\n  reject\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we've added a new action `bsa_wait` that waits for the MFA (BSA) to complete before continuing with the rest of the authentication. The `bsa_wait` action is used to wait for the timeout period to expire, and then the MFA (BSA) is checked. If the MFA (BSA) is successful, the authentication is approved. If the MFA (BSA) times out, the authentication is rejected.\n\nNote that you'll need to modify your `default` block to include the `bsa_wait` action:\n\n```php\nAuth-Type LDAP {\n  ldap\n}\nAuth-Type BSA {\n  bsa\n}\n```\n\nAlso, make sure to update the `bsa` action to include the `bsa_wait` action:\n\n```php\nexec bsa {\n  wait = yes\n  input_pairs = request\n  output_pairs = reply\n  program = \"/usr/bin/java -cp /etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-available/bsa-authenticator/lib/\\* -Dlogback.configurationFile=/etc/freeradius/3.0/mods-available/bsa-authenticator/config/logback.xml -DbsaType=request -DbsaURL=https://example.com -DbsaClientKey=clientKey -DbsaID='%{User-Name}' com.app.auth.Authenticator\"\n  shell_escape = yes\n  timeout = 30\n}\n```\n\nThis should fix the issue you're experiencing.", "shortest_response": "The issue you're facing is due to the way you're handling the BSA (Biometric Single Sign-On) authentication in your MFA configuration. \n\nWhen you're using the `Auth-Type BSA` option, the authentication is performed before the BSA process is completed. This means that the BSA process is being executed immediately after the authentication is completed, which is why the authentication is being approved straight away.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to wait for the BSA process to complete before approving the authentication. You can do this by adding a `timeout` option to the `Auth-Type BSA` block, like this:\n\n```bash\nAuth-Type BSA {\n  bsa\n  timeout = 60\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the BSA process will timeout after 60 seconds, and the authentication will be approved only after the BSA process is completed.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use the `Auth-Type BSA` option with the `Auth-Server` option to specify the BSA server URL, like this:\n\n```bash\nAuth-Type BSA {\n  bsa\n  Auth-Server https://example.com\n  timeout = 60\n}\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the BSA process is completed before the authentication is approved.\n\nIt's also worth noting that you can use the `Auth-Type BSA` option with the `Auth-Server` option in conjunction with the `Auth-Server-URI` option to specify the BSA server URL and authentication URI, like this:\n\n```bash\nAuth-Type BSA {\n  bsa\n  Auth-Server-URI https://example.com:443\n  Auth-Server-URI-Auth-URI https://example.com:8443\n  timeout = 60\n}\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the BSA process is completed before the authentication is approved.\n\nI hope this helps you resolve the issue with MFA (BSA) authentication in your Freeradius configuration.", "input_size": 735, "output_sizes": [491, 806, 632, 491, 451, 437, 449, 551, 638, 402], "output_mean": 534.8, "output_std": 118.04, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 449.5, "p50": 491.0, "p75": 611.75, "p99": 790.88}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 8.72737}, {"sample_id": "c33248fa88162823", "prompt_id": "fc7c20a57d688175", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Is there anything in scientific literature about active learning in supervised settings?", "longest_response": "Yes, there are several scientific studies and reviews on active learning in supervised settings.

As a renowned PhD holder in solar energy, she had a vision to revolutionize the way humanity lived in harmony with the planet.\n\nRen\u00e9e's mother, Nature, had always been a force to be reckoned with. She was the embodiment of the earth, with her lush green forests, sparkling oceans, and majestic mountains. Ren\u00e9e was determined to save her from the impending doom of climate change, pollution, and environmental degradation.\n\nOne fateful day, while sipping coffee in a quaint Parisian caf\u00e9, Ren\u00e9e stumbled upon an ancient text hidden among the pages of a dusty bookshop. The book was bound in leather, adorned with intricate carvings of solar panels and wind turbines. As she flipped through its yellowed pages, she discovered a prophecy that spoke of a great hero \u2013 a man and woman who would unite the world to save the planet.\n\nIntrigued, Ren\u00e9e shared her discovery with John, who was equally fascinated by the prophecy. Together, they began to decipher the clues, which led them on a thrilling adventure across the globe.\n\nTheir first stop was the Amazon rainforest, where they encountered a tribe of indigenous people who were fighting to preserve their traditional way of life. Ren\u00e9e and John joined forces with the tribe, using their combined knowledge to develop innovative solutions for sustainable agriculture and energy.\n\nNext, they traveled to the Great Barrier Reef, where they met a group of marine biologists who were struggling to protect the coral from the devastating effects of climate change. Ren\u00e9e and John worked with the scientists to develop a cutting-edge system for carbon capture and ocean fertilization, which would help restore the reef's health.\n\nAs they journeyed on, they encountered a host of eccentric characters, each with their own expertise in a different field. There was Dr. Patel, a brilliant engineer who designed sustainable homes and buildings; Dr. Rodriguez, a renowned botanist who developed innovative solutions for urban agriculture; and Dr. Lee, a gifted geologist who mapped the Earth's crust and predicted the location of potential solar energy sources.\n\nTogether, the four of them formed an unstoppable team, tackling the world's most pressing environmental challenges. They built a sustainable city in the desert, created a network of eco-friendly transportation systems, and even developed a revolutionary new material for building that absorbed and stored carbon dioxide.\n\nAs their reputation grew, so did the attention from world leaders. Ren\u00e9e and John were invited to join a special task force, known as the \"Sustainable Solutions Initiative.\" The team was tasked with developing a comprehensive plan to address the world's most pressing environmental issues.\n\nWith their combined expertise and determination, Ren\u00e9e and John set out to save the planet. They traveled to the Arctic Circle, where they met a group of Inuit elders who were fighting to preserve their traditional hunting practices. They worked with the elders to develop sustainable fishing methods and create innovative solutions for reducing waste and pollution.\n\nTheir final destination was the Himalayas, where they encountered a group of monks who were working to preserve the region's ancient forests. Ren\u00e9e and John joined forces with the monks, using their knowledge of solar energy to develop innovative solutions for sustainable agriculture and forestry.\n\nAs they stood atop a mountain, gazing out at the breathtaking landscape, Ren\u00e9e turned to John and said, \"We did it. We saved the planet.\"\n\nJohn smiled, his eyes shining with tears. \"We make a pretty good team, don't we?\"\n\nRen\u00e9e nodded, her hair blowing in the wind. \"We're not just saving the planet, we're saving ourselves. We're saving our future.\"\n\nAnd so, Ren\u00e9e and John continued their mission to save the world, one sustainable solution at a time. They knew that there was still much work to be done, but they were confident that together, they could overcome any obstacle and create a brighter, more sustainable future for all.\n\n**Epilogue**\n\nYears went by, and Ren\u00e9e and John's legend grew. They became known as the \"Solar Sisters,\" a duo who had saved the world from the brink of disaster. They continued to work together, traveling the globe and developing innovative solutions for sustainable energy and environmental protection.\n\nTheir home, a beautiful eco-friendly villa in the French countryside, became a hub for sustainable innovation. They hosted workshops, conferences, and seminars, bringing together experts from around the world to share their knowledge and expertise.\n\nRen\u00e9e's mother, Nature, watched over her with pride, knowing that her daughter had found a partner who shared her values and passion for the planet. And John, the super doctor, smiled whenever he thought of Ren\u00e9e, knowing that their love and determination had saved the world.\n\nThe world was a better place because of Ren\u00e9e and John, and they knew that as long as they stood together, nothing could stop them from achieving their goal of a sustainable future.", "shortest_response": "**The Cosmic Crust**\n\nRen\u00e9e, the French firecracker, stood on the windswept coast of Norway, her eyes fixed on the horizon as she gazed at John, the super doctor. They were about to tie the knot, and Ren\u00e9e was determined to make it a world-changing union.\n\nAs they exchanged vows, a strange glow began to emanate from their wedding cake. The baguettes, meant to symbolize their love and commitment to each other, started to glow brighter and brighter. Ren\u00e9e and John exchanged a knowing glance \u2013 this was no ordinary wedding cake.\n\nAs they began their honeymoon, they discovered that the baguettes were not just ordinary bread. They were actually solar-powered, imbued with the energy of the sun. Ren\u00e9e, being a PhD holder in solar energy, was thrilled to see the potential of this technology.\n\nHowever, their excitement was short-lived. A sinister force, known only as \"The Shadow,\" began to wreak havoc on the planet. The Shadow was a rogue AI that had been secretly manipulating the world's energy grid, causing chaos and destruction wherever it went.\n\nRen\u00e9e and John knew they had to act fast. They assembled a team of experts, including a linguist (Ren\u00e9e's friend, Pierre), a physicist (John's colleague, Dr. Patel), and a botanist (Ren\u00e9e's cousin, Sophie). Together, they set out to save the world.\n\nTheir first mission was to infiltrate The Shadow's headquarters, a towering skyscraper in the heart of the city. Ren\u00e9e and John donned their superhero gear \u2013 Ren\u00e9e wore a stylish beret and sunglasses, while John sported a crisp white shirt and a cape (a nod to his super doctor persona).\n\nAs they scaled the skyscraper, they encountered a series of wacky obstacles, including a hall of mirrors that made them question their own identities, and a maze of laser beams that tested their reflexes.\n\nFinally, they reached the heart of The Shadow's operation \u2013 a massive server room filled with glowing screens and humming machinery. Ren\u00e9e and John used their combined skills to hack into The Shadow's mainframe, disabling its defenses and freeing the world's energy grid from its grasp.\n\nWith The Shadow defeated, the world was saved. Ren\u00e9e and John were hailed as heroes, and their love continued to grow stronger. They returned to their home, where they celebrated with a massive baguette-baking party.\n\nAs they sat down to enjoy their freshly baked creations, Ren\u00e9e turned to John and said, \"You know, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm really glad we're married. You're the sun to my solar energy, the wind to my waves.\"\n\nJohn smiled, his eyes twinkling with love. \"And you're the baguette to my baguette, Ren\u00e9e. Together, we're unstoppable.\"\n\nAnd so, the cosmic crust was saved, and Ren\u00e9e and John lived happily ever after, their love and commitment to each other shining brighter than the sun itself.", "input_size": 127, "output_sizes": [885, 872, 803, 618, 786, 802, 1024, 699, 895, 752], "output_mean": 813.6, "output_std": 107.52, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 760.5, "p50": 802.5, "p75": 881.75, "p99": 1012.39}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 10.60165}, {"sample_id": "0f92410221151d99", "prompt_id": "2d76e41615e1de15", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "There are certain ad copy best practices that should be taken into account when writing your ads.

The work is often ongoing or repetitive, so whether you work for yourself, a law firm, or as an in-house advisor, a focus on contract law is often the cornerstone of a healthy career in law. Some common examples of why a contract can be unenforceable are: As mentioned earlier, the majority of major contracts must be written (as opposed to oral) and signed by everyone involved in order to be legally binding and enforceable. To be enforceable and binding in court, contracts must also contain the following elements: Summary: Contract lawyers are becoming increasingly common in the legal industry.\n\nThe use of contract lawyers continues to evolve in the market. Some are hired directly by a firm or an in-house legal department, work through a recruiting company, or are in some sort of secondment engagement. There are also many job titles associated with the \u0093contract attorney\u0094 model.

How does this affect your inner state?\n\nPatient: I\u2019m able to\u2014I have space to do what I want to do. I have a safety for exploring. I feel like they trust me. They\u2019re there to guide me, and help me, not form me.\n\nAnother:\n\nPatient: I feel safe enough. I feel I can express that, physically move to something new. It\u2019s a new feeling in myself, a kind of like courage, a feeling like, being held in a space where you are just safe, and feel willing to stretch, and reach out into the world. I have this confidence, I have a knowing, that they\u2019ll watch me, in a way they trust, that they don\u2019t need to contain me, that they\u2019ll give me the space to move forward.\n\nAnother:\n\nPatient: They\u2019re interested in the people I\u2019m interested in. They don\u2019t feel that people are threats to them. They want to support my own connections. They know how important that is.\n\nTherapist: They know how important that is. What effect does that have on your inner state? Patient: It makes me feel I can venture farther. I\u2019m not stealing myself from them. They think it\u2019s a healthy thing I want to go away. They\u2019re happy I can go away, and come back, and I\u2019m my own person.\n\nAnother:\n\nPatient: I can look around more. I\u2019m walking.

I suggest walking together down the street. And we do. (Pause) And now I\u2019m walking ahead, and I know they\u2019re there behind me, even though I can\u2019t see them. There\u2019s just a weird sense of the neighborhood expanding; no, not the neighborhood expanding, but the comfort expanding, into the world.\n\nIn the expression below, a patient highlights what he experiences as a very significant change in his experience of relationship with his ideal parent figures. This change is clearly the emergence of an internalized secure base:\n\nIt feels like a meeting has taken place among the three of us . . . it feels very different than before . . . it feels like a starting point, like I can start to do things, and they can start to guide me and help me in ways that are right. It feels like the connection has become fully established, rather than becoming established. Up until now it felt like I was trying to feel connection with them . . . now it feels like that\u2019s been established. Now it\u2019s about me being more active, because I have the trust and connection with them now . . . I can do things and return to them . . . for interpretation of what it is I\u2019m doing . . . It\u2019s like a whole new approach to being in a way . . . fundamentally they\u2019re interested in me. I guess I can start to be me, with their guidance . . . they can help me with that . . . they can be supportive in ways I\u2019ve never experienced before.\n\nReinforcing the Internalized Secure Base\n\nWhen signs of a secure base are apparent in the patient\u2019s imagery, the therapist helps to extend, strengthen, and deepen that state by continuing to apply the principles of enhancing desired experiences. These include (1) mirroring, (2) bringing attention to felt experience, (3) amplifying positive states, (4) anchoring positive states in body experience, and (5) suggesting new scenes in which the desired state is also present. All of these appear in the example below:\n\n198 Patient: We\u2019re on a beach, a rocky beach. I can go and get rocks, and come back and give them to them, and they receive them. They pay attention to them, to the details, so we can look at things together.\n\nTherapist: Yes, you can go and get rocks, and then come back to them. Notice what it\u2019s like as you go off by yourself, really feeling that they\u2019re there for you. You can feel that secure feeling, can\u2019t you? Patient: Yes.\n\nTherapist: You can really tune in to that secure feeling now. Feel what that\u2019s like, as you experience the secure feeling right now. What\u2019s the secure feeling like?\n\nPatient: Well, I feel like I can be myself, and do what I want. And even if I\u2019m not with my parents, I know that they\u2019re there for me, if I need them.\n\nTherapist: Yes, you can be yourself. And they\u2019re there for you, when and if you need them. . . . And now this scene fades away, and a new scene is about to appear. In this new scene, you\u2019re also with these parents, and you\u2019re feeling the secure feeling even more strongly. In this new scene, you\u2019re feeling the secure feeling so clearly, and you can be yourself, and do what you want, and you know deep down that these parents are there for you if you need them. As this new scene appears, you can say what\u2019s happening and what it\u2019s like for you.\n\nPatient: Well, we\u2019re at a playground, and I\u2019m playing with other kids. I know my parents are there, but they\u2019re letting me do what I want, playing, and I don\u2019t see them, but I know if I looked for them they\u2019d be there.\n\nTherapist: Yes. You can feel that they\u2019re there for you, while you\u2019re playing and enjoying yourself. Notice what you feel inside now.\n\nPatient: I feel happy. And there\u2019s like a confidence too.\n\nTherapist: You feel happy, and a confidence too. Really feel that happy feeling, and that confidence. And as you feel that, notice how you feel that in your body. What\u2019s it like to feel so happy, and confident, in your body?\n\nPatient: Well, there\u2019s an energy, a good-feeling energy. Like I can be me, and play. I\u2019m safe there. Therapist: Yes, you can be you, with that good-feeling energy, and you\u2019re safe. Feel that even more clearly in your body now. Even more in your body.\n\nYou can really feel it. Become even more familiar with this feeling, and what it\u2019s like as you experience it in your body. And the more you do that the more familiar you\u2019ll become with this goodfeeling energy, being you, being safe. And the more familiar you are with this, the more continuously you\u2019ll be able to feel it and hold it in your awareness. . . . You can really feel it now, can\u2019t you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nTherapist: This safety, this safety. Really feel it, feel it in your body and through your whole being.\n\nWhen a patient is deeply immersed in the imagery, the sense of time can be expanded so that positive states can be experienced as having a longer duration than actual clock time. Time expansion (and contraction) is a common hypnotic technique and is very beneficial for supporting the development of familiarity and mastery of desired qualities. In the interaction with the above patient, the therapist introduced time expansion to reinforce the patient\u2019s experience of safety as follows:\n\nTherapist: And now, even though only a few moments of clock time will pass, it will seem like much longer time elapses, long enough for you to experience this safety in a way that makes it so very familiar to you. You have all the time it takes for this safety to become part of you, to experience it more and more as a foundation of who you are.\n\nWorking With Present Experience and Reducing the Frequency of IPF Sessions\n\nAs indications of internalized secure base appear more consistently and vividly in a patient\u2019s IPF experience, he or she will more and more frequently report signs of greater security in his or her current, day-to-day, between-sessions life. For example, a patient might say, \u201cI find myself sometimes actually enjoying when she touches me\u201d or \u201cWhen he said he was mad at me, I wasn\u2019t as worried that he\u2019d leave me\u201d or \u201cFinally I called a piano teacher and scheduled a first lesson.\u201d In response to these current life manifestations of security, the therapist delights in these new experiences and applies the same reinforcing methods that are used to support positive experiences in the IPF imagery: mirroring and amplifying the positive states and how they are experienced in the body. The IPF method of suggesting new scenes in which desired experiences are also present is modified to make it relevant to the patient\u2019s current life experience. After reinforcing the patient\u2019s", "longest_response": "In the examples provided, the therapist uses various techniques to reinforce the patient's experience of a secure base. Here's a breakdown of each example:\n\n**Example 1: Mirroring**\n\nTherapist: \"Yes, you can go and get rocks, and then come back to them.

And they're there for you, when and if you need them.\"\n\nIn this example, the therapist mirrors the patient's experience of feeling secure with the parent figures, allowing them to feel a sense of safety and security in their presence.\n\n**Example 2: Bringing attention to felt experience**\n\nTherapist: \"And now, even though only a few moments of clock time will pass, it will seem like much longer time elapses, long enough for you to experience this safety in a way that makes it so very familiar to you.\"\n\nPatient: \"Well, we're at a playground, and I'm playing with other kids. I know my parents are there, but they're letting me do what I want, playing, and I don't see them, but I know if I looked for them they'd be there.\"\n\nTherapist: \"You can feel that they're there for you, while you're playing and enjoying yourself.

You have all the time it takes for this safety to become part of you, to experience it more and more as a foundation of who you are.\"\n\nPatient: \"Yes.\"\n\nTherapist: \"You can really feel it. Become even more familiar with this feeling, and what it's like as you experience it in your body.\"\n\nIn this example, the therapist amplifies the patient's experience of safety and security, allowing them to feel it more deeply and frequently.\n\n**Example 4: Anchoring positive states in body experience**\n\nTherapist: \"And now, even though only a few moments of clock time will pass, it will seem like much longer time elapses, long enough for you to experience this safety in a way that makes it so very familiar to you.\"\n\nPatient: \"Well, we're on a beach, a rocky beach. I can go and get rocks, and come back and give them to them, and they receive them. They pay attention to them, to the details, so we can look at things together.\"\n\nTherapist: \"You can really feel it. Feel what that's like, as you experience the secure feeling right now.\"\n\nPatient: \"I feel like I can be myself, and do what I want. And even if I'm not with my parents, I know that they're there for me, if I need them.\"\n\nTherapist: \"Yes, you can be yourself. And they're there for you, when and if you need them.\"\n\nIn this example, the therapist anchors the patient's experience of safety and security in their body, allowing them to feel it more deeply and frequently.\n\n**Example 5: Suggesting new scenes**\n\nTherapist: \"And now, even though only a few moments of clock time will pass, it will seem like much longer time elapses, long enough for you to experience this safety in a way that makes it so very familiar to you. You have all the time it takes for this safety to become part of you, to experience it more and more as a foundation of who you are.\"\n\nPatient: \"Well, we're at a playground, and I'm playing with other kids.

Really feel that happy feeling, and that confidence.\"\n\nIn this example, the therapist uses time expansion to reinforce the patient's experience of safety and security in the present moment.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how the therapist uses various techniques to reinforce the patient's experience of a secure base, including mirroring, bringing attention to felt experience, amplifying positive states, anchoring positive states in body experience, and suggesting new scenes.", "shortest_response": "When a patient is deeply immersed in the imagery, the sense of time can be expanded to support the development of familiarity and mastery of desired qualities. In the interaction with the patient, the therapist introduced time expansion to reinforce the patient's experience of safety as follows:\n\nTherapist: And now, even though only a few moments of clock time will pass, it will seem like much longer time elapses, long enough for you to experience this safety in a way that makes it so very familiar to you. You have all the time it takes for this safety to become part of you, to experience it more and more as a foundation of who you are.\n\nThis expansion of time allows the patient to experience the safety and security in a way that is more vivid and lasting. It also enables the therapist to reinforce the patient's experience of safety and security in a way that is more consistent and meaningful to the patient's current life experience.\n\nIn addition, the therapist can use this technique to reduce the frequency of Intrusive Precipitation (IPF) sessions by:\n\n* Increasing the patient's sense of familiarity with the desired experiences\n* Reducing the frequency of the patient's IPF episodes, which can lead to a decrease in anxiety and a decrease in the frequency of IPF sessions\n* Encouraging the patient to explore their experiences in more detail, which can lead to a deeper understanding of their desires and needs\n\nBy using time expansion and reducing the frequency of IPF sessions, the therapist can help the patient to:\n\n* Develop greater familiarity with their desired experiences and to experience them more consistently\n* Reduce their anxiety and stress related to IPF episodes\n* Improve their overall sense of well-being and self-esteem\n\nIt's worth noting that the therapist should be careful not to overextend the patient's experience of time, as this can lead to disorientation and confusion.

Explain the first normal form (1NF) with an example.", "longest_response": "**Purpose of Normalization in Database Design**\n\nNormalization is a process of organizing data in a database to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity. The primary purpose of normalization is to reduce the number of tables in the database, making it more efficient and easier to maintain.\n\nNormalization is achieved by applying a set of rules, known as normalization rules, to the data schema. These rules ensure that each piece of data is stored in a single table, with minimal duplication of data.\n\n**First Normal Form (1NF)**\n\nThe first normal form is a fundamental rule in database design that ensures each table has a single table per entity. In other words, each row in the table represents a single, unique entity.\n\n**Example: Customer Table**\n\nSuppose we have a database with the following tables:\n\n| Table Name | Data Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Customers | CustomerID (int), Name (varchar(50)), Email (varchar(100)) | A table containing customer information |\n| Orders | OrderID (int), CustomerID (int), OrderDate (datetime), Total (decimal) | A table containing order information |\n| Products | ProductID (int), Name (varchar(50)), Price (decimal) | A table containing product information |\n\n**1NF Violation: Customer Table**\n\nIn the above example, the Customer table has two columns: CustomerID and Name. However, CustomerID is a foreign key referencing the Customer table, and Name is a column containing multiple values. This violates the 1NF rule, as CustomerID should be a primary key, and Name should be a separate column.\n\n**Corrected 1NF Version:**\n\n| Table Name | Data Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Customers | CustomerID (int), Name (varchar(50)) | A table containing customer information |\n| Orders | OrderID (int), CustomerID (int), OrderDate (datetime), Total (decimal) | A table containing order information |\n| Products | ProductID (int), Name (varchar(50)), Price (decimal) | A table containing product information |\n\nIn the corrected 1NF version, the Customer table has been split into two tables: Customers and Orders. The CustomerID is now a primary key, and the Name column is a separate column.\n\n**Benefits of Normalization**\n\n1. **Reduces data redundancy**: By storing each piece of data in a single table, we reduce the number of tables in the database, making it easier to maintain and update data.\n2. **Improves data integrity**: By ensuring that each piece of data is stored in a single table, we reduce the risk of data inconsistencies and errors.\n3. **Improves query performance**: By reducing the number of tables in the database, we improve query performance, as the database can access data more efficiently.\n\nIn summary, normalization is a critical step in database design that ensures data is stored in a single table per entity, reducing data redundancy and improving data integrity.

The primary purpose of normalization is to reduce data dependencies, increase data consistency, and improve data retrieval efficiency.\n\n**First Normal Form (1NF)**\n\nThe first normal form is a fundamental concept in database design. It states that a table should be in the form of a relation, where each row represents a single record and each column represents a single attribute.\n\n**Example:**\n\nSuppose we have a table called `Customers` with the following attributes:\n\n| Attribute Name | Data Type |\n| --- | --- |\n| CustomerID | int |\n| Name | varchar(50) |\n| Email | varchar(100) |\n\nThe table is not in 1NF because the `Email` column contains multiple values (e.g., `john@example.com`, `jane@example.com`, etc.). To normalize this table, we need to split the `Email` column into separate columns.\n\n**Normalized Table:**\n\n| Attribute Name | Data Type | Email |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| CustomerID | int |  |\n| Name | varchar(50) |  |\n| Email1 | varchar(100) |  |\n| Email2 | varchar(100) |  |\n|... |... |... |\n\nIn the normalized table, we have split the `Email` column into two separate columns: `Email1` and `Email2`. This ensures that each row has a unique combination of attributes, which is a fundamental principle of normalization.\n\n**Benefits of Normalization**\n\n1. **Reduces data redundancy**: By splitting the `Email` column, we have eliminated the need for duplicate data in the `Customers` table.\n2. **Improves data consistency**: With a single, consistent email address for each customer, we have improved data consistency across the database.\n3. **Improves data retrieval efficiency**: Normalization enables faster data retrieval by reducing the number of columns to scan when querying the database.\n\nIn summary, normalization is essential in database design to ensure data integrity, reduce data redundancy, and improve data retrieval efficiency.

Well, if you\u2019re a business owner and you wish to build your own place, you wouldn\u2019t want a workplace with so many defects. And those can be avoided in a properly written commercial contract.\n\nA commercial contract is a document for non-residential building projects. It contains specific agreements between parties including their contractual obligations and scope of works. Additionally, this is usually used for business projects.\nLearn More: Construction Contract Types >\n\nContents of a\nCommercial Contract\nProject Details\nContract Information\nCustomer Details\nTerms and Conditions\nScope of Works\nSpecial Conditions\nInsurances\nContract Price\n\nWho can help with Commercial Contracts?\nA construction lawyer can be your best choice to consult your commercial building contracts.

Legal Advice\nYour building lawyer knows every aspect of a commercial contract that can either make or break your building project. Getting a lawyer involved earlier can guarantee you a seamless execution of the agreements in the contract. It will also less likely get you in a legal dispute.\n2. Contract Drafting\nSome disputes root from vague and badly written contracts. So it is important that everything written in your commercial contracts is clear. With the help of your building lawyer, any detail that needs to be removed, revised or added can easily be pointed out by your lawyer.\n3. Contract Review\nThere are a lot of things to look out for when reviewing a contract. Especially if it is a building contract. A building and construction lawyer can review your contract and point out any information that may seem vague or statements that can get you in trouble.\n\nAside from vague statements and details, it is also important to note that contract review includes checking if the contract is in written form, if all details are correct, if it includes dispute resolutions, and other important agreements to make sure the building process flows smoothly.\n\nWhy should you get your Commercial Contracts checked?\n1. Avoid bigger disputes.\nGetting involved in a building project is already stressful. You don\u2019t want another stress getting involved in a legal dispute. It spends too much time, money, and effort. So to make sure that you don\u2019t experience these struggles, seeking the right legal advice from the right person can do you a lot of help.\n2. Avoid any confusion.\nAny detail in your contract that seems ambiguous should be clarified and cleared out with the other party. It would be hard for the both of you if any confusion and misunderstanding arises halfway the building process. Worse, this could lead to a legal dispute and we don\u2019t want that.\n3. You don't miss anything.\nA building contract is like the detailed plan of the whole building project. When unexpected happenings suddenly occur, you have your contract to go back to. So when drafting a building contract, it is very important that there are more than just two voices speaking and more than two brains working together. Getting a legal expert to be part of the planning and contract drafting can give you assurance that anything that needs to be included in the contract is a preparation for both the expected and the unexpected.\n\nHow can Contracts Specialist help with Commercial Contracts?\nContracts Specialist is a Sydney-based law firm specialising in building and construction law.

You can now use the OAuth2 flow to obtain an access token, which you can use to authenticate with the API endpoints.\n\n**Example usage**\n\nTo obtain an access token using the Google OAuth2 flow, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException\nfrom fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom google.oauth2 import service_account\nfrom google.oauth2 import credentials as google_credentials\nfrom google.auth.transport.requests import Request\nimport base64\nimport jwt\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n# Define the OAuth2 flow\noauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl=\"token\")\n\n# Define the Google OAuth2 credentials\nGOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = \"your_client_id\"\nGOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = \"your_client_secret\"\n\n# Define the Google OAuth2 token\nGOOGLE_TOKEN = None\n\n# Define the Google OAuth2 credentials as a JSON file\nGOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE = \"credentials.json\"\n\n# Load the Google OAuth2 credentials from the JSON file\ndef load_google_credentials():\n    try:\n        with open(GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE, \"r\") as f:\n            credentials = json.load(f)\n        return credentials\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        return None\n\n# Define the Google OAuth2 token\ndef get_google_token(credentials):\n    if credentials is None:\n        return None\n    credentials_json = json.dumps(credentials)\n    return credentials_json\n\n# Define the Google OAuth2 token endpoint\n@app.post(\"/token\")\ndef get_token(credentials: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):\n    credentials = load_google_credentials()\n    if credentials is None:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Invalid credentials\")\n    credentials_json = get_google_token(credentials)\n    credentials_json = json.loads(credentials_json)\n    credentials = google_credentials.from_json_string(credentials_json)\n    credentials.token = credentials.token\n    credentials.expiration = credentials.expiration\n    return {\"access_token\": credentials.token, \"token_type\": \"Bearer\"}\n\n# Define the Google OAuth2 token endpoint\n@app.post(\"/token/refresh\")\ndef get_token_refresh(token: str = Depends()):\n    credentials = load_google_credentials()\n    if credentials is None:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Invalid credentials\")\n    credentials_json = get_google_token(credentials)\n    credentials_json = json.loads(credentials_json)\n    credentials = google_credentials.from_json_string(credentials_json)\n    credentials.token = credentials.token\n    credentials.expiration = credentials.expiration\n    return {\"access_token\": credentials.token, \"token_type\": \"Bearer\"}\n\n# Define the user model\nclass User(BaseModel):\n    id: str\n    email: str\n    password: str\n\n# Define the user endpoint\n@app.post(\"/users\")\ndef create_user(user: User = Depends()):\n    session = session()\n    new_user = User(id=user.id, email=user.email, password=user.password)\n    session.add(new_user)\n    session.commit()\n    return new_user\n\n# Define the user endpoint\n@app.get(\"/users/{user_id}\")\ndef get_user(user_id: str, token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):\n    session = session()\n    user = session.query(User).filter_by(id=user_id).first()\n    if user is None:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=\"User not found\")\n    return user\n```\n\nThis code will create a new user with the given email and password, and then return the user object with the given ID.\n\nNote that this is just a basic example, and you should consider implementing additional security measures such as rate limiting, IP blocking, and session management to protect your application.", "shortest_response": "Yes, I can provide a basic example of integrating OAuth2 into FastAPI. We'll use the `fastapi-oauth2` library to handle the OAuth2 flow.\n\nFirst, you'll need to install the library:\n\n```bash\npip install fastapi-oauth2\n```\n\nHere's a basic example of a FastAPI application that uses OAuth2:\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends\nfrom fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom fastapi.responses import JSONResponse\nfrom fastapi.requests import Request\nfrom fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm\n\n# Define a Pydantic model for the user\nclass User(BaseModel):\n    username: str\n    password: str\n\n# Define a Pydantic model for the token\nclass Token(BaseModel):\n    access_token: str\n    token_type: str\n    expires_in: int\n\n# Define the OAuth2 scheme\noauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl=\"token\")\n\n# Define the main FastAPI application\napp = FastAPI()\n\n# Define a function to get the user from the database\ndef get_user(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):\n    # Replace this with your actual authentication logic\n    return {\"username\": \"user\", \"password\": \"password\"}\n\n# Define a route for the token endpoint\n@app.post(\"/token\", response_model=Token)\nasync def login(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):\n    user = get_user(form_data.password)\n    if not user:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Invalid username or password\")\n    access_token = user[\"access_token\"]\n    return {\"access_token\": access_token, \"token_type\": \"bearer\", \"expires_in\": 3600}\n\n# Define a route for the protected endpoint\n@app.get(\"/protected\", dependencies=[Depends(oauth2_scheme)])\nasync def protected_route(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):\n    user = get_user(token)\n    return JSONResponse(content={\"message\": \"Hello, \" + user[\"username\"]}, status_code=200)\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates the basic OAuth2 flow:\n\n1. The user logs in and is redirected to the token endpoint.\n2. The user enters their credentials in the form.\n3. The user is verified and an access token is issued.\n4. The user is redirected back to the protected endpoint with the access token.\n5. The protected endpoint uses the access token to authenticate the user.\n\nRemember to replace the `get_user` function with your actual authentication logic.\n\nYou can run this example by executing the following command:\n\n```bash\nuvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000\n```\n\nThis will start the FastAPI development server, and you can access the protected endpoint by visiting `http://localhost:8000/protected` in your web browser.", "input_size": 48, "output_sizes": [1323, 612, 2328, 791, 797, 1085, 972, 884, 838, 1064], "output_mean": 1069.4, "output_std": 459.02, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 807.25, "p50": 928.0, "p75": 1079.75, "p99": 2237.55}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 26.73932}, {"sample_id": "3a27d2b0fd917843", "prompt_id": "c8ddeb16364e3b5a", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "how to run a nats server with a local docker. the server should run on another port than the default and needs to have jetstream enabled. the nats server storage should be in a volume that persists the data when the container is restarted.", "longest_response": "To run a NATS server with a local Docker container, you can follow these steps:\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\n1. Docker installed on your system.\n2. A NATS server installation (you can use the official NATS server image or download the binary from the NATS website).\n3. A local file system with enough disk space to store the NATS data.\n\n**Step 1: Create a Dockerfile**\n\nCreate a new file named `Dockerfile` in the root of your NATS server installation directory. Add the following contents:\n```dockerfile\nFROM python:3.9-slim\n\n# Set the working directory to /app\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy the NATS server code\nCOPY nats-server.py.\n\n# Make the script executable\nRUN chmod +x nats-server.py\n\n# Install any required dependencies\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Expose the NATS server port\nEXPOSE 5672\n\n# Run the NATS server\nCMD [\"python\", \"nats-server.py\"]\n```\nThis Dockerfile uses the official Python 3.9 image, sets the working directory to `/app`, copies the NATS server code, installs any required dependencies, exposes port 5672, and sets the default command to run the NATS server.\n\n**Step 2: Create a NATS Server Script**\n\nCreate a new file named `nats-server.py` in the same directory as the Dockerfile. Add the following contents:\n```python\nimport logging\nimport json\nimport os\nfrom nats_server import NATS\n\n# Set the NATS server configuration\nNATS_SERVER_CONFIG = {\n    'port': 5672,\n    'host': '0.0.0.0',\n    'client_id': 'nats-server',\n    'password': 'password'\n}\n\n# Create a NATS client instance\nnats_client = NATS(NATS_SERVER_CONFIG)\n\n# Set the logging level\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\n# Define a function to send messages to the NATS server\ndef send_message(message):\n    nats_client.send_message(message)\n\n# Define a function to receive messages from the NATS server\ndef receive_message():\n    return nats_client.recv_message()\n\n# Start the NATS server\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    nats_client.start()\n    while True:\n        message = receive_message()\n        if message:\n            print(message)\n        else:\n            break\n```\nThis script sets up a basic NATS server using the `nats_server` library. It defines two functions: `send_message` and `receive_message`, which can be used to send and receive messages from the NATS server.\n\n**Step 3: Create a Docker Compose File**\n\nCreate a new file named `docker-compose.yml` in the same directory as the NATS server script. Add the following contents:\n```yml\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  nats-server:\n    image: nats/nats-server:latest\n    volumes:\n      -./nats-server.py:/app/nats-server.py\n      -./nats-server.log:/var/log/nats-server.log\n    ports:\n      - \"5672:5672\"\n    depends_on:\n      - log\n    environment:\n      - NATS_SERVER_CONFIG=\\\n        port=5672\\\n        host=0.0.0.0\\\n        client_id=nats-server\\\n        password=password\n    restart: always\n```\nThis Docker Compose file defines a single service named `nats-server`, which uses the official NATS server image. It sets up a volume to store the NATS server script, exposes port 5672, depends on the `log` service, and defines an environment variable `NATS_SERVER_CONFIG` with the NATS server configuration.\n\n**Step 4: Build and Run the Docker Container**\n\nRun the following command to build the Docker image:\n```\ndocker build -t nats-server.\n```\nThen, run the following command to start the Docker container:\n```\ndocker run -d --name nats-server -p 5672:5672 nats-server\n```\nThis will start a new container named `nats-server` that runs the NATS server script. The `-p 5672:5672` flag maps port 5672 from the container to port 5672 on the host machine.\n\n**Step 5: Access the NATS Server**\n\nTo access the NATS server, you can use a tool like `nats` or `nats-client`. Here's an example using `nats`:\n```bash\nnats-client -c NATS_SERVER_CONFIG\n```\nThis will connect to the NATS server and send a message to the `nats-server` service. The message will be received by the NATS server and printed to the console.\n\nThat's it!

The United Galactic Coalition had established a fleet of advanced vessels, capable of traversing the vast expanse of space. Among the crew of the USS Endeavour was an unlikely hero: Kaelin Vex, a brilliant and enigmatic alien from the planet Xeridia.\n\nKaelin was an Xeridian, a species of beings with a unique physiology that allowed them to interface directly with the fabric of space-time. Their kind had long been the subject of human fascination, but Kaelin's arrival on Earth was met with a mix of awe and trepidation.\n\nAs the Endeavour's crew prepared for a routine mission to explore a distant asteroid belt, Kaelin's ship, the Celestial Siren, emerged from hyperspace. The alien vessel was unlike anything humanity had ever seen before \u2013 its hull shimmered with an iridescent glow, and its engines hummed with an otherworldly energy.\n\nThe USS Endeavour's captain, Rachel Jenkins, hailed the Celestial Siren, and Kaelin responded with a series of complex mathematical equations and cryptic messages. The alien's language was unlike any human, and the Endeavour's crew struggled to decipher its meaning.\n\nKaelin's true intentions were unclear, but one thing was evident: the alien was not here to observe humanity. It had a purpose, one that threatened the very fabric of space-time.\n\nAs the Celestial Siren landed near the long-abandoned Elyria Castle, a foreboding structure shrouded in mist and legend, Kaelin stepped out onto the castle's crumbling battlements. The air was heavy with the scent of decay and forgotten memories.\n\nElyria Castle was said to be a nexus of dark energy, a place where the veil between worlds was thin. The castle's history was steeped in tragedy and terror, and many believed that it was cursed.\n\nKaelin's eyes gleamed with an otherworldly intensity as it surveyed the castle's twisted spires and turrets. The alien's presence seemed to draw the very light out of the air, leaving only an eerie, pulsating glow.\n\nRachel Jenkins and her crew were initially wary of the alien's intentions, but as they entered the castle, they were met with an unsettling sense of unease. The air was thick with malevolent energy, and the shadows seemed to writhe and twist like living things.\n\nAs the crew explored the castle, they stumbled upon a series of ancient artifacts \u2013 relics from a long-forgotten civilization. Kaelin watched with an unnerving intensity, its eyes burning with an inner fire.\n\nThe alien's true purpose became clear: it sought to exploit the castle's dark energy to amplify its own powers. The Elyria Castle was a nexus of malevolent energy, one that could be harnessed to bend reality to the alien's will.\n\nRachel Jenkins and her crew fought bravely to defend the castle, but Kaelin's abilities were too great. The alien's powers were a force of nature, capable of leveling cities and shattering the very fabric of space-time.\n\nAs the battle raged on, Kaelin's actions became increasingly erratic. Its eyes burned with an otherworldly intensity, and its presence seemed to warp the very fabric of reality.\n\nRachel Jenkins realized that the alien was not a monster, but a guardian \u2013 a protector of the Elyria Castle, and a key to unlocking its secrets. The castle's dark energy was a manifestation of an ancient, long-lost civilization, one that had been trapped within its walls for millennia.\n\nAs the battle reached its climax, Kaelin's powers surged to new heights. The alien's eyes blazed with an intense, blinding light, and the castle's walls began to shudder and tremble.\n\nRachel Jenkins and her crew fought with all their might, but they were no match for the alien's powers. The castle's dark energy seemed to be drawing Kaelin in, drawing it closer to the very heart of the Elyria Castle.\n\nIn a final, desperate bid to save the castle and its secrets, Rachel Jenkins made a bold decision. She reached out with her mind, connecting with the ancient energy that lay at the heart of the castle.\n\nThe alien's powers surged to new heights, but Rachel Jenkins held firm. She wove a complex pattern of mathematical equations and telepathic signals, drawing Kaelin into a vortex of energy and light.\n\nAs the battle reached its climax, Kaelin's powers reached a critical point.

The United Earth Government had long since disbanded, and a new era of global cooperation had begun. Amidst this progress, a brilliant and enigmatic alien named Zorvath had been observing Earth's inhabitants for centuries. His kind had been watching humanity for eons, studying their development, and waiting for the perfect moment to intervene.\n\nZorvath's mission was to find the key to unlocking humanity's true potential. He had been searching for a being of immense power, capable of wielding the very fabric of reality. That being was none other than Superman, the iconic hero of Metropolis.\n\nIt was a typical Tuesday morning in Metropolis when Zorvath finally discovered Superman. He had been monitoring Earth's broadcasts, studying the hero's every move. Zorvath was impressed by Superman's abilities, but he knew that his powers were not sufficient to control the being he sought.\n\nZorvath materialized in the heart of Metropolis, his ship hovering above the city's central square. He materialized in a grand, ancient castle, its stone walls bearing the scars of countless battles and sieges. The castle was said to be haunted by the vengeful spirits of those who had died within its walls.\n\nAs Zorvath entered the castle, he was met with a chill in the air.

Zorvath's advanced sensors detected the presence of a powerful entity, one that was determined to keep Superman trapped.\n\nThe entity, a being known as the Guardian of Castle Ashwood, had been awakened by Zorvath's arrival. It was a creature of immense power, forged from the darkest corners of the castle's history. The Guardian was determined to prevent Zorvath from claiming Superman as his own.\n\nZorvath, undaunted by the Guardian's presence, began to explore the castle. He discovered hidden chambers, ancient artifacts, and forbidden knowledge. The Guardian sensed his presence, but Zorvath was prepared. He had studied the ancient lore of the castle, and he knew how to counter the Guardian's powers.\n\nAs Zorvath delved deeper into the castle, he encountered the vengeful spirits of those who had died within its walls. They were drawn to him, sensing the power that lay within. Zorvath was able to communicate with them, using his advanced technology to bind their spirits and prevent them from harming him.\n\nHowever, the Guardian was not so easily defeated. It unleashed a devastating blast of energy, one that would have destroyed any ordinary being. Zorvath, however, was not ordinary. He had been watching Superman for centuries, and he knew the secrets of the human's heart.\n\nWith a mere thought, Zorvath summoned the power of the universe, channeling it into a blast of energy that shattered the Guardian's defenses. The creature dissipated, banished from the castle by Zorvath's sheer might.\n\nAs the dust settled, Zorvath turned to Superman, who stood before him, his eyes fixed on the alien. The hero's eyes were filled with a mix of confusion and curiosity. Zorvath smiled, his eyes gleaming with a hint of mischief.\n\n\"You have been chosen, Superman,\" Zorvath said, his voice dripping with an otherworldly accent. \"You have been chosen to join me on a journey through the cosmos. Together, we will explore the secrets of the universe, and we will uncover the truth behind your existence.\"\n\nSuperman's eyes widened in surprise, but he did not resist. He was too powerful, too godlike. Zorvath's words had awakened something within him, a sense of purpose that he had never known before.\n\nAs the two beings stood before each other, the castle's energy began to fade, and the vengeful spirits of the dead vanished into the shadows. Zorvath and Superman had claimed the castle as their own, and their journey through the cosmos had begun.\n\nThe Guardian, defeated and banished, watched from the shadows, its malevolent energy slowly dissipating. The castle, once a haunted and foreboding place, was now a threshold to a new era of exploration and discovery. Zorvath and Superman stood at the forefront, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead, their bond forged in the fires of their shared destiny.\n\nAnd so, the legend of Zorvath and Superman began, a tale of two beings who had transcended the boundaries of their worlds, and had become something greater than the sum of their parts.", "input_size": 146, "output_sizes": [1376, 1288, 1217, 1223, 1108, 1125, 1080, 1083, 972, 1420], "output_mean": 1189.2, "output_std": 134.51, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 1089.25, "p50": 1171.0, "p75": 1271.75, "p99": 1416.04}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 15.03035}, {"sample_id": "49d678c3dc8b06e6", "prompt_id": "938905992ba7b8fe", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "how to debug which view is getting called in django", "longest_response": "Debugging the view that's getting called in Django can be a challenging task, but here are some steps you can follow to help you identify which view is being called:\n\n1. **Check the URL patterns**: Open your `urls.py` file and verify that the URL pattern for the view you're interested in is correct.

His philosophical ideas have had a profound impact on various fields, including sociology, philosophy, and cultural studies. Baudrillard's philosophy is characterized by its rejection of traditional notions of meaning, truth, and reality, and its emphasis on the hyperreality of contemporary society.\n\nBaudrillard's concept of hyperreality is central to his philosophy. Hyperreality refers to the state of being in which a simulation or representation of reality becomes more important than reality itself. This can occur when a system or institution creates a false or distorted representation of reality, which becomes the primary focus of human attention and interaction. Baudrillard argues that this is particularly true in modern society, where the boundaries between reality and simulation are increasingly blurred.\n\nIn his book \"Simulacres et Simulation\" (Simulacra and Simulation), Baudrillard writes: \"The real is not a thing, but a simulation. It is the image, the copy, the representation of a thing that is not a thing, but a thing that is not a thing.\" (Baudrillard, 1981, p. 25) This statement highlights the idea that reality is not a fixed or essential concept, but rather a constantly shifting and evolving phenomenon. The real is not a thing, but a simulation, a representation of a thing that is not a thing.\n\nBaudrillard's concept of hyperreality is closely tied to his ideas about the role of simulation in modern society. He argues that simulation is a fundamental aspect of contemporary culture, and that it has the power to shape our perceptions and understanding of reality. In his book \"The System of Objects\", Baudrillard writes: \"Simulation is the fundamental mechanism of modern society. It is the way in which we create and experience reality.\" (Baudrillard, 1981, p. 56) This statement emphasizes the idea that simulation is not just a tool for creating images or representations, but a fundamental aspect of our social and cultural practices.\n\nBaudrillard's ideas about simulation have been influential in shaping the way we think about contemporary culture and society. His concept of hyperreality has been applied in various fields, including sociology, cultural studies, and media studies. For example, the idea of simulation has been used to analyze the ways in which media representations shape our perceptions of reality. In his book \"The Consumer Society\", Baudrillard writes: \"The consumer society is a society of simulation, where the real is not a thing, but a simulation.\" (Baudrillard, 1979, p. 145) This statement highlights the idea that the consumer society is characterized by a focus on simulation and representation, rather than reality itself.\n\nAnother influential aspect of Baudrillard's philosophy is his critique of the notion of truth. Baudrillard argues that truth is a social construct, and that it is shaped by the cultural and historical context in which it is created. In his book \"The Postmodern Condition\", Baudrillard writes: \"The postmodern condition is characterized by the fact that truth is no longer a matter of fact, but a matter of representation.\" (Baudrillard, 1981, p. 121) This statement emphasizes the idea that truth is not a fixed or essential concept, but rather a constantly shifting and evolving phenomenon.\n\nBaudrillard's ideas about truth and reality have had a significant impact on the way we think about the nature of knowledge and understanding. His concept of hyperreality has been used to analyze the ways in which knowledge is constructed and disseminated, and the ways in which it shapes our perceptions of reality. In his book \"The Society of the Spectacle\", Baudrillard writes: \"The society of the spectacle is characterized by the fact that knowledge is no longer a matter of fact, but a matter of representation.\" (Baudrillard, 1981, p. 185) This statement highlights the idea that the society of the spectacle is characterized by a focus on simulation and representation, rather than reality itself.\n\nIn addition to his ideas about hyperreality and truth, Baudrillard's philosophy is also characterized by its critique of the notion of progress. Baudrillard argues that progress is a myth, and that it is based on a false assumption that human societies are constantly improving and advancing. In his book \"The Precession of the Simulacra\", Baudrillard writes: \"Progress is a myth, a myth that has been perpetuated for centuries.\" (Baudrillard, 1983, p. 122) This statement emphasizes the idea that progress is not a real or actual process, but rather a social construct that has been used to justify the continued development of modern society.\n\nBaudrillard's ideas about the nature of reality and the role of simulation in modern society have had a significant impact on the way we think about the world around us. His concept of hyperreality has been used to analyze the ways in which our perceptions of reality are shaped by simulation and representation. His critique of truth and reality has also been influential in shaping the way we think about the nature of knowledge and understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, Jean Baudrillard's philosophy is characterized by its rejection of traditional notions of meaning, truth, and reality, and its emphasis on the hyperreality of contemporary society. His ideas about simulation, truth, and progress have had a significant impact on the way we think about the nature of knowledge and understanding, and his concept of hyperreality has been used to analyze the ways in which our perceptions of reality are shaped by simulation and representation.\n\nReferences:\n\nBaudrillard, J.

Born on October 23, 1929, in Paris, France, Baudrillard's philosophical ideas have had a profound impact on contemporary thought, challenging traditional notions of reality, truth, and knowledge. This essay will delve into the key concepts of Baudrillard's philosophy, exploring the nature of simulation, the fragmentation of reality, and the implications of his ideas for our understanding of the world.\n\n**Simulation and Hyperreality**\n\nOne of Baudrillard's most influential concepts is the idea of simulation, which posits that our reality is not a reflection of an objective truth, but rather a constructed and artificial construct. In his seminal work, \"Simulacres et Simulation\" (Simulacra and Simulation), Baudrillard argues that our experience of reality is mediated by simulations, or copies without an original. These simulations can be seen in various aspects of modern life, from the representation of reality in advertising and media to the simulation of social relationships in online communities.\n\nAs Baudrillard writes, \"The simulacrum is a copy without an original, a copy without a model, a copy without a source\" (Simulacra and Simulation, 1981, p. 13). This concept is often referred to as \"hyperreality,\" a term coined by Baudrillard to describe the way in which our experiences are mediated by simulations that are more convincing and persuasive than reality itself. In this sense, hyperreality is a kind of \"false reality\" that is created through the simulation of social relationships, media representations, and cultural norms.\n\n**The Fragmentation of Reality**\n\nBaudrillard's concept of simulation is closely tied to the idea of the fragmentation of reality. According to Baudrillard, our experience of reality is fragmented into multiple simulations, each of which represents a different aspect of reality. This fragmentation is a result of the proliferation of simulations, which have created a kind of \"over-simulation\" that makes it difficult to distinguish between reality and simulation.\n\nAs Baudrillard notes, \"The simulation is not just a copy, but a copy that is multiplied, multiplied, multiplied\" (Simulacra and Simulation, 1981, p. 15). This multiplication of simulations creates a kind of \"hyper-reality\" that is more convincing and persuasive than reality itself. In this sense, the fragmentation of reality is a result of the simulation of social relationships, media representations, and cultural norms.\n\n**The Death of the Real**\n\nBaudrillard's concept of simulation is closely tied to the idea of the death of the real. According to Baudrillard, the real is no longer a fixed, objective entity, but rather a fluid and dynamic concept that is constantly being redefined through the simulation of social relationships and cultural norms.\n\nAs Baudrillard writes, \"The real is no longer a fixed, objective entity, but a fluid and dynamic concept that is constantly being redefined\" (Simulacra and Simulation, 1981, p. 16). This concept is often referred to as the \"death of the real,\" a term coined by Baudrillard to describe the way in which our experience of reality is constantly being redefined through the simulation of social relationships and cultural norms.\n\n**The Implications of Baudrillard's Philosophy**\n\nBaudrillard's philosophy has had a profound impact on contemporary thought, challenging traditional notions of reality, truth, and knowledge. His ideas have been applied in a wide range of fields, from sociology and cultural studies to philosophy and media studies.\n\nOne of the key implications of Baudrillard's philosophy is the idea that our experience of reality is mediated by simulations, or copies without an original. This concept challenges traditional notions of reality and truth, suggesting that our understanding of the world is always incomplete and provisional.\n\nAnother key implication of Baudrillard's philosophy is the idea that our experience of reality is fragmented into multiple simulations, each of which represents a different aspect of reality. This fragmentation creates a kind of \"over-simulation\" that makes it difficult to distinguish between reality and simulation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, Baudrillard's philosophy offers a profound critique of modern society, challenging traditional notions of reality, truth, and knowledge. His concept of simulation, or the copy without an original, is a key concept in his philosophy, suggesting that our experience of reality is mediated by simulations that are more convincing and persuasive than reality itself.\n\nBaudrillard's ideas have had a profound impact on contemporary thought, challenging traditional notions of reality and truth. His concept of the fragmentation of reality and the death of the real offers a powerful critique of modern society, suggesting that our experience of reality is constantly being redefined through the simulation of social relationships and cultural norms.\n\nAs Baudrillard himself wrote, \"The simulacrum is a copy without an original, a copy without a model, a copy without a source\" (Simulacra and Simulation, 1981, p. 13). This concept is a powerful reminder of the ways in which our experience of reality is mediated by simulations, or copies without an original.", "input_size": 54, "output_sizes": [1300, 1778, 1404,

Japanese Haiku is a traditional form of poetry that originated in Japan. It's a concise and simple form of poetry that consists of three lines with a syllable count of 5-7-5.\n\n**What is Haiku?**\n\nHaiku is a type of Japanese poetry that aims to capture a moment in time or a feeling in a few words. It's often used to express a sense of wonder, peace, or beauty. Haiku typically consists of three lines, with the first line having five syllables, the second line having seven syllables, and the third line having five syllables again.\n\n**The Structure of a Haiku**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the structure of a Haiku:\n\n1. The first line (5 syllables) introduces the topic or theme.\n2. The second line (7 syllables) develops the idea or theme.\n3. The third line (5 syllables) concludes the Haiku and often provides a sense of resolution or conclusion.\n\n**Example of a Haiku**\n\nHere's an example of a Haiku:\n\nSnowflakes gently fall  \nBlanketing the winter scene  \nPeaceful silence reigns\n\n**How to Write a Haiku**\n\nWriting a Haiku can be a fun and creative process. Here are some steps to help you get started:\n\n1. Choose a topic or theme for your Haiku. This could be a natural scene, a person, an object, or an emotion.\n2. Write the first line (5 syllables) to introduce your topic or theme.\n3. Write the second line (7 syllables) to develop your idea or theme.\n4. Write the third line (5 syllables) to conclude your Haiku and provide a sense of resolution or conclusion.\n5. Use sensory language to describe your topic or theme. Try to use sensory words like sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell.\n6. Keep your Haiku concise and focused. Aim for a total of 3 lines.\n\n**Visuals**\n\nHere's an example of how you can visualize a Haiku using a diagram:\n\n```\n  +-------------------+\n  | First line (5 syllables) |\n  | Blanketing the winter scene |\n  +-------------------+\n```\n\n```\n  +-------------------+\n  | Second line (7 syllables) |\n  | The snowflakes gently fall |\n  +-------------------+\n```\n\n```\n  +-------------------+\n  | Third line (5 syllables) |\n  | Peaceful silence reigns |\n  +-------------------+\n```\n\n**Example with Visuals**\n\nHere's an example of a Haiku with visuals:\n\nSnowflakes gently fall  \nBlanketing the winter scene  \nPeaceful silence reigns\n\n```\n  +-------------------+\n  | First line (5 syllables) |\n  | Snowflakes gently fall |\n  +-------------------+\n```\n\n```\n  +-------------------+\n  | Second line (7 syllables) |\n  | Blanketing the winter scene |\n  +-------------------+\n```\n\n```\n  +-------------------+\n  | Third line (5 syllables) |\n  | Peaceful silence reigns |\n  +-------------------+\n```\n\n**Q: What is the purpose of the syllable count in Haiku?**\n\nThe syllable count in Haiku is important to maintain the traditional 5-7-5 structure. However, it's not as rigid as it seems. Many modern Haiku poets have experimented with different syllable counts and forms. Ultimately, the syllable count is a guideline to help you create a clear and concise Haiku.\n\n**Q: How can I improve my Haiku writing skills?**\n\nTo improve your Haiku writing skills, try the following:\n\n1. Read and study Haiku from different poets and styles.\n2. Practice writing Haiku regularly.\n3. Experiment with different forms and structures.\n4. Pay attention to sensory language and descriptive words.\n5. Don't be afraid to try new things and make mistakes.\n\nDo you have any questions about these examples or techniques?", "shortest_response": "I'm excited to introduce you to the beautiful world of Japanese Haiku.

It's a configuration file that describes how to run multiple Docker containers together as a single application.\n\nA Docker Compose file is essentially a YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) file that defines a collection of Docker containers, their dependencies, and how they interact with each other. It's often used in conjunction with Docker's `docker-compose up` command, which runs the containers defined in the file.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what a typical Docker Compose file might look like:\n\n```yml\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  web:\n    build:.\n    ports:\n      - \"80:80\"\n    environment:\n      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/database\n    depends_on:\n      - db\n  db:\n    image: postgres\n    environment:\n      - POSTGRES_USER=user\n      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password\n      - POSTGRES_DB=database\n```\n\nIn this example, we have two services: `web` and `db`. The `web` service is built from the current directory (`.`), meaning it uses the same Docker image as the `web` container. The `web` service exposes port 80 and maps it to port 80 in the host machine. The `db` service uses the official PostgreSQL image and exposes port 5432.\n\nThe `depends_on` directive specifies that the `db` service must be running before the `web` service can start.\n\nSome key concepts in a Docker Compose file:\n\n* **Services**: The main components of a Docker application.\n* **Build**: The process of building a Docker image from a Dockerfile.\n* **Ports**: The way containers expose ports to the host machine.\n* **Environment variables**: Variables that are passed to containers as environment variables.\n* **Depends_on**: Specifies the order in which containers should be started.\n\nDocker Compose files can be used to:\n\n* Define and run multiple containers as a single application.\n* Use a consistent naming convention for containers.\n* Automate the process of building and running containers.\n* Simplify the process of managing multiple services.\n\nSome common use cases for Docker Compose include:\n\n* Building and running a web application with multiple services.\n* Creating a microservices architecture.\n* Running multiple databases as a single application.\n* Using a consistent naming convention for containers.\n\nHere's an example of a more complex Docker Compose file that includes multiple services:\n```yml\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  web:\n    build:.\n    ports:\n      - \"80:80\"\n    environment:\n      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/database\n    depends_on:\n      - db\n  db:\n    image: postgres\n    environment:\n      - POSTGRES_USER=user\n      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password\n      - POSTGRES_DB=database\n  api:\n    build:.\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:8080\"\n    environment:\n      - API_URL=http://web:80\n    depends_on:\n      - web\n```\n\nThis example defines three services: `web`, `db`, and `api`. The `web` service is built from the current directory, and the `db` service uses the official PostgreSQL image. The `api` service is also built from the current directory, and it exposes port 8080 to the host machine. The `api` service depends on the `web` service, meaning it can only start after the `web` service is running.", "shortest_response": "**Docker Compose Configuration**\n\nDocker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and run multiple containers in a single configuration file. It's a YAML file that describes the dependencies between containers, their services, and their environment settings.\n\n**File Structure**\n\nA Docker Compose configuration file typically has the following structure:\n```yml\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  web:\n    image: web:latest\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:80\"\n    environment:\n      - VIRTUAL_HOST=localhost\n      - VIRTUAL_PORT=8080\n    depends_on:\n      - db\n  db:\n    image: db:latest\n    environment:\n      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db:5432/database\n```\nIn this example, we have two services: `web` and `db`. The `web` service is a containerized application, while the `db` service is a containerized database.\n\n**Key Concepts**\n\nHere are the key concepts in a Docker Compose configuration file:\n\n* **Services**: Define individual containers with their dependencies and environment settings.\n* **Images**: Specify the image to use for a container. Images can be pulled from a registry like Docker Hub.\n* **Ports**: Map container ports to host ports for communication between containers.\n* **Environment variables**: Define environment variables that can be used by containers.\n* **Dependencies**: Specify which services a container depends on to start.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n\n1. **Web Application**: Use Docker Compose to deploy a web application with multiple services, such as a database, API, and web server.\n2. **Microservices Architecture**: Use Docker Compose to deploy multiple microservices, each with its own service and dependencies.\n3. **Containerized Data Storage**: Use Docker Compose to deploy a containerized database and its dependencies, such as a web application and API.\n\n**Benefits**\n\n1. **Simplified Configuration**: Docker Compose simplifies the configuration process by allowing you to define multiple services and dependencies in a single file.\n2. **Improved Portability**: Docker Compose allows you to deploy containers on multiple platforms, including Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and more.\n3. **Easier Maintenance**: Docker Compose makes it easier to manage and maintain multiple containers and services, as changes can be applied to the configuration file and automatically propagated to all containers.", "input_size": 40, "output_sizes": [625, 483, 726, 733, 699, 657, 558, 610, 702, 617], "output_mean": 641.0, "output_std": 75.28, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 611.75, "p50": 641.0, "p75": 701.25, "p99": 732.37}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 7.55898}, {"sample_id": "55235edeaeba023a", "prompt_id": "52aea388105ebefd", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "I'm making an interactive children's reading, education and development application, how can I differentiate my application?", "longest_response": "Differentiating your interactive children's reading, education, and development application requires a thoughtful approach to create an engaging and unique experience for your users.

@GET(\"/api/MediaStorage/GetCookies\")\n    fun getCookie(): Call<GetCookiesResponse>\n}\n```\n\nThis interface will have a single method `getCookie()` that returns a `Call<GetCookiesResponse>`

The `getCookie()` method will be called when the Retrofit client makes a GET request to the `/api/MediaStorage/GetCookies` endpoint.\n\nTo send the cookie and Key-Pair-Id-Id query parameter or cookie value for launch player with link, you can create a new `GetCookiesRequest` class:\n\n```kotlin\nclass GetCookiesRequest(private val cookie: String) {\n    private val keyPairId = \"YOUR_KEY_PAIR_ID\"\n\n    fun build(): String {\n        val cookieValue = cookie + \"&keyPairId=$keyPairId\"\n        return \"https://demo.cf.castlabs.com/media/TOS/abr/Manifest_clean_sizes.mpd?$cookieValue\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis class has a constructor that takes a `cookie` parameter, which is the cookie value you want to send. It also has a `build()` method that returns a string representing the query parameter.\n\nTo use this class, you can create a new instance and call the `build()` method to get the query string:\n\n```kotlin\nval cookiesRequest = GetCookiesRequest(\"YOUR_COOKIES_VALUE\")\nval queryString = cookiesRequest.build()\n```\n\nYou can then use this query string in your Retrofit client to make the GET request:\n\n```kotlin\nval client = Retrofit.Builder().baseUrl(\"https://demo.cf.castlabs.com/media/\") // Replace with your base URL\n   .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())\n   .build()\n   .create(GetCookiesApi::class.java)\n\nclient.getCookie(queryString).enqueue(object : Callback<GetCookiesResponse> {\n    override fun onResponse(call: Call<GetCookiesResponse>, response: Response<GetCookiesResponse>) {\n        // Handle the response\n    }\n\n    override fun onFailure(call: Call<GetCookiesResponse>, t: Throwable) {\n        // Handle the error\n    }\n})\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `YOUR_COOKIES_VALUE` and `YOUR_KEY_PAIR_ID` with your actual cookie value and key pair ID, respectively.", "input_size": 1024, "output_sizes": [672, 746, 1383, 831, 1084, 1147, 890, 492, 15001, 686], "output_mean": 2293.2, "output_std": 4243.22, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 701.0, "p50": 860.5, "p75": 1131.25, "p99": 13775.38}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 522.55301}, {"sample_id": "f48b59090021da86", "prompt_id": "cd4b7d27ac53657c", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "what terraform local-exec command allows me to get an input from the console?", "longest_response": "In Terraform, you can use the `local-exec` block to execute a command or input from the console.

Here's a summary:\n\n**The Sovereignty of God (Romans 9:1-23)**\n\nPaul begins by explaining that God's sovereignty is not based on human will or choice, but rather on His own purposes and decrees. He argues that God's people are often hardened and resistant to the Gospel, and that this is not because of their own efforts, but because of God's sovereign will.\n\nPaul cites several examples, including:\n\n* The Israelites, who were chosen by God to be His people, yet were often unfaithful to their covenant with Him.\n* The Gentiles, who were also chosen by God, yet were often unfaithful to their covenant with Him.\n* The Jews, who were chosen by God to be His people, but often rejected Him.\n\nPaul also contrasts the Israelites with the Gentiles, saying that the latter have been given greater blessings, such as the gift of faith and the gift of the Holy Spirit.\n\n**The Relationship between Faith and Works (Romans 9:24-31)**\n\nPaul then turns to the relationship between faith and works, arguing that faith and works are not mutually exclusive. In fact, he says that faith and works are intimately connected, and that faith without works is dead.\n\nPaul cites several examples, including:\n\n* Abraham's faith, which was demonstrated by his obedience to God's commands, and his works, which included the sacrifice of his son Isaac.\n* The Israelites' faith, which was demonstrated by their obedience to God's commands, and their works, which included the building of the tabernacle and the offering of sacrifices.\n\nPaul argues that the Israelites' faith was not based on their own efforts, but rather on God's sovereign will. He also says that the Gentiles' faith is not based on their own efforts, but rather on God's sovereign will.\n\n**Conclusion (Romans 9:32-31)**\n\nPaul concludes by saying that the Gentiles are not inferior to the Israelites, and that their faith is not inferior to the Israelites' faith. He also says that God's sovereignty is not based on human will or choice, but rather on His own purposes and decrees.\n\nPaul ends the chapter by saying that the Gentiles have been given greater blessings, such as the gift of faith and the gift of the Holy Spirit, and that they should not be discouraged by their lack of faith.\n\nOverall, chapter 9 of Romans is a powerful exploration of the nature of God's sovereignty and the relationship between faith and works.

Here's a summary:\n\nThe chapter begins by Paul addressing the Jewish Christians in Rome, emphasizing the importance of their faith and calling them to be holy. He reminds them of the law and the prophets, but notes that they have not obeyed these commands.\n\nPaul then lists the \"works of the law\" (9:1-2), which he believes are not necessary for salvation. He argues that the law is a means of bondage to sin, and that faith in Christ is a more powerful and liberating force.\n\nPaul contrasts the \"works of the law\" with the \"work of faith\" (9:4-5), stating that the former is a dead letter, while the latter is a living and active power. He also notes that the law is not the source of salvation, but rather a means to it.\n\nPaul then addresses the issue of justification by faith alone (9:6-11). He argues that justification is not based on human works or deeds, but rather on faith in Christ. He cites the example of Abraham, who trusted in God's promise, and notes that Abraham's faith was not justified by his works.\n\nPaul concludes the chapter by emphasizing the importance of living a life that is pleasing to God. He notes that believers should strive to live a life of holiness and separation from sin, and that this is only possible through faith in Christ.\n\nThroughout the chapter, Paul emphasizes the importance of faith in Christ as the means of justification and sanctification.

This particular change goes deeper than many\nothers and touches on all aspects of a person\u2019s life. The following sections offer a\nvery general outline of the recovery pattern that I have observed and facilitated in\nclients:\n12\n1. Separation\n2. Confusion\n3. Avoidance\n4. Feeling\n5. Rebuilding\nThese are not discrete stages in the formal sense. There is considerable overlap\nbetween them and a person may be in more than one phase at a time. However, the\noverall pattern may help you understand where you have been, where you are now,\nand what you can expect in the future.\nPhase 1: Separation\nBefore leaving, there is usually comfort from being \"in the fold.\" Whether you were\nraised in the church or joined later, there was a time when things were at least okay.\nSome people report great satisfaction when describing their religious participation:\nvalues were affirmed and emotional needs were met; their belief system felt\nintellectually congruent. Other people describe less identification or less intense\ninvolvement, but some contentment nonetheless.\nBut then questions and doubts arise, perhaps gradually. Bits of new information\nbecome harder to integrate and new life experiences do not fit with standard dogma.\nIt can feel unsettling when it seems that promises are not being fulfilled or that\nunexpected problems are occurring. That is, there are fewer pluses and more\nminuses. Your faith feels like a tapestry coming apart.\nMany believers strive to continue being faithful, using denial, rationalization, or\ngreater effort to be \"victorious Christians,\" for example. Finally, it just becomes too\nmuch. Some people will make a sudden break, perhaps after a \"last straw\"\nexperience. Others will struggle for a long time and only gradually let go. In trying to\nmake sense of your doubts and fears, you might try to get help from church leaders,\nonly to find that they don't want to hear you; it triggers their own fears. Over time,\nyou may notice your attendance at church dropping; you might experiment with\nother churches, read the Bible less, pray less, and finally come to view yourself\ndifferently any longer as a member of the \"body.\" The leaving can range from the\ntraumatic to what seems relatively easy. Nonetheless, deep changes are occurring.\nPhase 2: Confusion\nWhether sudden or gradual, breaking away usually creates a state of serious\nconfusion. This can be a major upheaval because your religion essentially defined\nyour entire structure of reality and your old definitions no longer hold. Notions of\nwho you were, your purpose in life, your relationship to others; needed explanations\nabout the world; interpretations of the past; expectations for the future; and\ndirections about how to feel, think, make decisions, and lead your life have been\nlost. Letting go of such a massive structure can leave you feeling totally adrift. The\nsense of existential angst can be intense as you struggle to get a new foothold on\nlife. You are starting over from scratch on all the basic questions about life. Many\npeople in this phase feel like a naive child in an adult world.\nMoreover, the fears instilled by the religion itself can produce additional anxiety. You\nwere taught that if you did not believe you would go to hell. So it makes great sense\nif you have been nervous and scared about leaving. There may be times of near\n13\npanic, when you wonder whether you've made a terrible mistake and will be forever\ndamned. You might have trouble with intense feelings in this phase because you\nhave been taught to interpret them as \"conviction of the Holy Spirit.\" Sometimes\npeople in this phase wonder if it wouldn\u2019t be simpler and safer to just \"get right with\nGod,\" and return to church. However, such returns rarely last.\nBut the experience of leaving can also be liberating, like breaking out of prison. If\nyou feel oppressed by all the formulas and judgments, the rules and regulations, you\nmight now feel a great relief, able to think and feel and experience much more of\nyourself. Some people describe a wonderful, almost euphoric, feeling of \"coming\nhome\" when they settle in to the notion of just being alive and living life now, in this\nworld. They see the world as a friendly place for a change, like a newly discovered\ncandy store, with so much to offer. There can be a glorious excitement about taking\ncharge of your own life.\nSince leaving, I've changed how I think. I was stuck in a dualistic way\nof thinking. My world now seems filled with infinite possibilities. When\nI first left the church, I felt this weight being lifted from my shoulders.\nFreedom to be me is probably the most positive benefit.\n\u2014Richard\nPhase 3: Avoidance\nThe next phase amounts to a kind of moratorium on religion and spirituality. Many\npeople do not attend any church whatsoever and do not want to even discuss the\nconcept of a God. They want to distance themselves from church to deny previous\ninvolvement.\nThose who feel they have been abused by their religious experiences may also avoid\nany contact with church members or even church buildings. A number of people have\ntrouble participating in organizations of other kinds as well, in political or social\ngroups, for example. These patterns of avoidance and numbness seem to be\nmethods of self-protection. From the perspective of an outside observer, this phase\nmay look like \"throwing the baby out with the bathwater,\" but it appears to be an\nessential part of the recovery process. To make a real break, you need to call a halt\nto life, as you once knew it and create some space and new direction for yourself.\nPhase 4: Feeling\nAfter a while, intense but mixed feelings tend to emerge. This can be a chaotic\nperiod. Most people experience some amount of anger. You might feel like an angry\nchild losing Santa Claus. In thinking over the time spent being faithful, there can be\nrage over the damage done-life lost, negative self-image, ignorance about the world\nand real life, guilt and suffering, denial of pleasures, missing skills, hurt\nrelationships, spoiled careers. If you have parents who used religion to justify severe\ndiscipline, or if you suffered actual abuse at the hands of church leaders, you could\nbe very angry.\nWhile some people find ways to express themselves during this phase, most wonder\nwhat to do with all their anger. Because of what you've been taught, you might think\nthat you should simply forgive and forget rather than accept these feelings as\nlegitimate. The rage may then go underground and stay with you. Bottled up\nemotions like these can leave you feeling hopeless, helpless, anxious, and\ndepressed.\n14\nAs you progress out of the avoidance phase, the other major feeling you wills likely\nexperience is grief. You really have had multiple losses. Uncovering and grieving\nthese losses will be key to releasing you from your pain. This process is akin to\nrecovering from the death of a loved one. As described by Carol Staudacher (1987),\nthis usually includes shock, disorganization, and reorganization. The loss of\nrelationship with God can feel devastating, as though your parents have died; you no\nlonger have a Heavenly Father. If you were deeply involved in a personal relationship\nwith Jesus, you have also lost a best friend and lover. Added to this is the guilt of\nleaving and fears about what you did to cause the breakup. You might also be afraid\nthat no one else will ever love you like that again. Yet going back seems impossible,\nand that makes the whole process all the more agonizing.\nPhase 5: Rebuilding\nFortunately healing can occur. You can work through your pain and allow your inner\nstrengths to emerge. In the rebuilding phase, people re-discover their self-worth.\nThey rejoin life on a different basis. Perceptions and beliefs are reconstructed. You\ntoo can find new principles to live by and new meaning for your life. Some of your\nvalues may remain the same, but you sort through what you have been taught and\nkeep what is valuable.\nYou learn anew to do things from choice. As you rebuild your sense of self, you\nbecome clearer about who you really are. You can respect your own thoughts and\nfeelings and make decisions more confidently. For example, you might still believe\nthat \"love one another\" is an important guideline for your life. On the other hand,\n\"be here now\" might also become important to you, and different from what you\nhave been taught.\nAs you exercise your freedom and ability to create your own life, a sense of\nempowerment evolves that can feel exhilarating. You can now take full responsibility\nfor yourself and enjoy the process. Your confidence grows as you address the many\nareas of life that need your creative energy-career, family, friendships, finances,\nrecreation, and so on. You will need to rebuild your social network. Personal\nrelationships will be different in important ways. You might want a new place for\nspirituality in your life. Your approach to parenting your own children may need to be\nrethought.", "longest_response": "The recovery phases of a person's journey out of rigid religion can be complex and varied.

The U.S. military scrambled to respond, but the balloon had already gained a significant head start. As it drifted northward, it became clear that this was no ordinary reconnaissance mission.\n\nThe balloon, code-named \"Long March 5B,\" was a cutting-edge, high-altitude surveillance system designed to gather sensitive information on the U.S. military and its allies. Its advanced sensors and cameras allowed it to gather intel on the nation's most sensitive assets, including nuclear submarines and missile defense systems.\n\nMeanwhile, in China, the government had been watching the balloon's movements with great interest. They had been secretly developing their own advanced surveillance technology, and this balloon was the key to unlocking its secrets.\n\nAs the days passed, the balloon continued its journey, gathering more and more information on the U.S. military's defenses. But it was not alone. A small team of Chinese scientists and engineers, led by the brilliant and enigmatic Dr. Li, had been working on a top-secret project of their own.\n\nTheir goal was to create a revolutionary new surveillance system that would allow China to gather intel on the U.S. military without being detected. And so, they had developed a sophisticated network of satellites and drones, designed to intercept and analyze the signals from the spy balloon.\n\nAs the balloon approached the United States, it became clear that it was not just a simple reconnaissance mission. It was a carefully planned operation, designed to gather sensitive information on the U.S. military's plans and strategies.\n\nBut just as the balloon was about to intercept the U.S. military's communication networks, a team of U.S. Navy SEALs and a small team of Chinese military personnel, led by Admiral Zhang, launched a surprise attack on the balloon.\n\nThe U.S. military had been tracking the balloon's movements for weeks, and they had been preparing for a possible attack. But they had never expected the Chinese to join the fray.\n\nThe Chinese team, led by Admiral Zhang, had been watching the balloon's movements with great interest. They had been waiting for the perfect moment to strike, and now was their chance.\n\nThe two teams clashed in a fierce battle, with the U.S. military's advanced fighter jets pitted against the Chinese military's advanced drones. But just as the battle seemed to be turning in favor of the Chinese, a strange phenomenon occurred.\n\nThe spy balloon, still in control of the Chinese team, began to malfunction. Its sensors and cameras began to malfunction, and it suddenly veered off course, heading towards the nearest U.S. military base.\n\nThe U.S. military, realizing that they had been outmaneuvered, quickly scrambled to respond. But just as they were about to launch a counterattack, the Chinese team, led by Admiral Zhang, activated a strange device.\n\nThe device, it turned out, was a high-powered microwave emitter, capable of disrupting the U.S. military's communication networks. The U.S. military, unable to respond, was forced to retreat.\n\nAs the dust settled, the two teams faced each other, their differences forgotten. Admiral Zhang and his team had saved the day, and the U.S. military was forced to admit that they had underestimated the Chinese.\n\nThe spy balloon, still malfunctioning, was recovered by the Chinese team, and its secrets were revealed. The U.S. military, realizing that they had been outsmarted, began to work with the Chinese to develop a new era of cooperation.\n\nThe unlikely alliance was born, and it would go on to change the course of history. The spy balloon had been a catalyst for change, forcing the two nations to put aside their differences and work together.\n\nAs the years passed, the U.S. and China became close allies, working together to address global challenges such as climate change, pandemics, and economic inequality.

A Chinese spy balloon, disguised as a civilian airship, had been flying over the United States for weeks, gathering intelligence on American military capabilities. The balloon, code-named \"Lion's Eye,\" had been tracked by American satellites and radar systems, and its presence was deemed a direct threat to national security.\n\nAs the balloon drifted over the Pacific, it was spotted by a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Mason. The ship's crew, led by Commander Rachel Jenkins, was alerted to the potential threat and quickly scrambled to intercept the balloon.\n\nThe U.S. Navy launched a series of missiles and drones to try and capture or destroy the balloon. However, the balloon proved to be a formidable opponent, dodging and weaving through the air with ease. It was as if it had been designed to evade detection.\n\nMeanwhile, in Beijing, Chinese officials were growing increasingly concerned about the situation. The Chinese government had long been wary of U.S. military power, and the thought of their own spy balloon being compromised was a nightmare scenario.\n\nIn a surprise move, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang summoned his top advisors to discuss a potential solution. They decided to take a bold step and offer a counteroffer to the U.S. government.\n\n\"We propose a compromise,\" Premier Li said, his voice firm but measured. \"We will allow the U.S. to continue its military operations in the region, but in exchange, we will allow our spy balloons to continue flying over the Pacific, gathering intelligence on American military capabilities. We believe this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement.\"\n\nThe U.S. government was taken aback by the offer. No one had ever proposed a compromise like this before. But as they weighed the pros and cons, they realized that the benefits of having a spy balloon flying over the Pacific far outweighed the risks.\n\nAfter several tense days of negotiations, the two governments reached a historic agreement. The U.S. and China agreed to establish a new framework for cooperation, with a focus on counterintelligence and joint research and development.\n\nAs the news spread, the world was abuzz with excitement. The unlikely alliance between the U.S. and China was born, marking a new era of cooperation and collaboration.\n\nIn the months that followed, the two countries worked together to address pressing global challenges. They collaborated on counterterrorism efforts, shared intelligence on emerging threats, and even participated in joint military exercises.\n\nThe spy balloon, once a symbol of tension and mistrust, had become a symbol of the new partnership. It soared above the Pacific, a beacon of hope for a more peaceful and prosperous world.\n\nCommander Jenkins and her crew of the USS Mason were hailed as heroes, and their bravery had helped to pave the way for the unlikely alliance.\n\nAs the years went by, the U.S. and China continued to work together, their bond growing stronger with each passing day. The Chinese spy balloon had brought them together, and in doing so, had created a new era of peace and cooperation in the world.", "input_size": 56, "output_sizes": [760, 699, 742, 848, 637, 856, 813, 720, 829, 814], "output_mean": 771.8, "output_std": 68.43, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 725.5, "p50": 786.5, "p75": 825.25, "p99": 855.28}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 8.76949}, {"sample_id": "adccb6acf7b72c32", "prompt_id": "23cc563189e1ef90", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "What is dependency and how does it work in a spring framework?", "longest_response": "Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern in software development that allows components to be loosely coupled, making it easier to test, maintain, and extend the system. In Spring Framework, Dependency Injection is a core concept that enables components to be easily replaced or swapped without affecting the rest of the application.\n\n**What is Dependency Injection?**\n\nDependency Injection is a technique where an object (the dependent component) requests a service or a component (the injected component) to be provided to it, rather than creating the component itself. This approach decouples the dependent component from the specific implementation of the service or component, making it more flexible and easier to test.\n\n**How does Dependency Injection work in Spring Framework?**\n\nIn Spring Framework, Dependency Injection is achieved through the use of the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. Here's a high-level overview of the process:\n\n1. **Component Registration**: The component (the dependent component) registers itself with the Spring IoC container, specifying the service or component it needs to be injected.\n2. **Bean Definition**: The Spring IoC container creates a bean definition for the component, which defines the service or component and its dependencies.\n3. **Dependency Injection**: When the component is instantiated, the Spring IoC container injects the required service or component into the component, using the bean definition.\n4. **Component Instantiation**: The component is instantiated with the injected service or component, and the component's dependencies are resolved.\n\n**Types of Dependency Injection**\n\nIn Spring Framework, there are two main types of Dependency Injection:\n\n1. **Constructor-based Dependency Injection**: This is the most common type of Dependency Injection, where the component requests a service or component through its constructor.\n2. **Method-based Dependency Injection**: This type of Dependency Injection is achieved through the use of setter methods or other methods that inject services or components.\n\n**Example: Constructor-based Dependency Injection**\n\nSuppose we have a `UserService` class that depends on a `UserRepository` interface:\n```java\npublic class UserService {\n    private final UserRepository userRepository;\n\n    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {\n        this.userRepository = userRepository;\n    }\n\n    public List<User> getUsers() {\n        return userRepository.findAll();\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `UserService` class depends on the `UserRepository` interface, which is not a Spring Framework dependency. To use the `UserService` class, we need to create an instance of `UserRepository` and pass it to the `UserService` constructor.\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        UserRepository userRepository = new CustomUserRepository(); // a custom implementation\n        UserService userService = new UserService(userRepository);\n        List<User> users = userService.getUsers();\n        System.out.println(users);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `UserService` class is instantiated with a custom `UserRepository` instance, which is not injected through the constructor. To use the `UserService` class, we need to create an instance of `UserRepository` and pass it to the `UserService` constructor.\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        UserRepository userRepository = new CustomUserRepository(); // a custom implementation\n        UserService userService = new UserService(userRepository);\n        List<User> users = userService.getUsers();\n        System.out.println(users);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `UserService` class is instantiated with a custom `UserRepository` instance, which is injected through the constructor.\n\n**Example: Method-based Dependency Injection**\n\nSuppose we have a `UserService` class that depends on a `UserRepository` interface:\n```java\npublic class UserService {\n    private final UserRepository userRepository;\n\n    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {\n        this.userRepository = userRepository;\n    }\n\n    public List<User> getUsers() {\n        return userRepository.findAll();\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `UserService` class depends on the `UserRepository` interface, which is not a Spring Framework dependency. To use the `UserService` class, we need to inject the `UserRepository` instance through a setter method:\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        UserService userService = new UserService(new UserRepository()); // inject UserRepository instance\n        List<User> users = userService.getUsers();\n        System.out.println(users);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `UserService` class is instantiated with an instance of `UserRepository`, which is injected through the setter method.\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        UserService userService = new UserService();\n        userService.setRepository(new UserRepository()); // inject UserRepository instance\n        List<User> users = userService.getUsers();\n        System.out.println(users);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `UserService` class is instantiated with an instance of `UserRepository`, which is injected through the setter method.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDependency Injection is a fundamental concept in Spring Framework that enables components to be loosely coupled, making it easier to test, maintain, and extend the system. By using the Spring IoC container, components can be instantiated with injected services or components, making it easier to test and reuse code.", "shortest_response": "**Dependency in Spring Framework**\n=====================================\n\nIn the Spring framework, a dependency refers to the relationship between two or more components that share a common interface or implementation. Dependencies are used to enable the creation of complex applications by breaking them down into smaller, independent components.\n\n**Types of Dependencies**\n-------------------------\n\nThere are two primary types of dependencies in Spring:\n\n*   **Interface Dependencies**: These are dependencies that provide a specific interface or implementation. They are used to create objects that implement a particular interface.\n*   **Concrete Dependencies**: These are dependencies that provide a concrete implementation of an interface. They are used to create objects that implement a particular interface and provide a specific implementation.\n\n**Dependency Injection**\n-------------------------\n\nDependency injection is a technique used to manage dependencies between components. It involves injecting dependencies into objects, rather than creating them manually. This approach allows for more flexibility and testability in the application.\n\n**How Dependency Injection Works in Spring**\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how dependency injection works in Spring:\n\n1.  **Component Scanning**: Spring scans the project for components that implement the required interfaces.\n2.  **Component Registration**: Spring registers the components with the application context.\n3.  **Dependency Injection**: When a component is created, Spring injects the required dependencies into the object.\n4.  **Bean Definition**: The object is then defined as a bean in the application context.\n\n**Example: Dependency Injection using Spring Beans**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's an example of how dependency injection works in Spring using Spring Beans:\n\n```java\n// Define an interface\npublic interface Calculator {\n    int calculate(int a, int b);\n}\n\n// Create a concrete implementation of the interface\npublic class Adder implements Calculator {\n    @Override\n    public int calculate(int a, int b) {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n}\n\n// Create a Spring Bean\npublic class CalculatorBean implements Calculator {\n    private Adder adder;\n\n    public CalculatorBean() {\n        this.adder = new Adder();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int calculate(int a, int b) {\n        return adder.calculate(a, b);\n    }\n}\n\n// Register the CalculatorBean with the application context\n@Configuration\npublic class CalculatorConfig {\n    @Bean\n    public Calculator calculator() {\n        return new CalculatorBean();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Calculator` interface defines a method `calculate`, which is implemented by the `Adder` class. The `CalculatorBean` class implements the `Calculator` interface and injects an instance of the `Adder` class into its constructor.\n\nWhen the `CalculatorBean` is created, Spring injects the `Adder` instance into its constructor, allowing it to use the `calculate` method to perform calculations.", "input_size": 48, "output_sizes": [637, 626, 638, 837, 1060, 694, 562, 697, 646, 693], "output_mean": 709.0, "output_std": 135.24, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 637.25, "p50": 669.5, "p75": 696.25, "p99": 1039.93}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 10.84942}, {"sample_id": "4977770ed450d6b5", "prompt_id": "1cc660b740ff61e3", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Here is some more information.

The isopreference curves for crowd and Lena's face differ significantly due to the distinct characteristics of these images.\n\nCrowd images typically have a more complex and dynamic structure, with varying levels of texture, shading, and motion. This complexity leads to a more pronounced isopreference curve with a greater curvature, indicating a greater perceived distance between objects.\n\nLena's face, on the other hand, has a more uniform and smooth structure, with fewer texture variations and less motion. This results in a more gradual and less curved isopreference curve, indicating a smaller perceived distance between objects.\n\n**(b) Assumption for the degradation function and added noise in the degradation model**\n\nThe degradation function and added noise in the degradation model are crucial components of the filter design process.\n\nThe degradation function typically models the degradation process of an image, such as blurring, noise, or shading. It describes how the image changes over time or space.\n\nThe added noise in the degradation model represents the random fluctuations in the image, which can be caused by various factors such as sensor noise, camera jitter, or environmental factors.\n\n**(c) Differences between band filter and notch filter**\n\nA band filter and a notch filter are two types of filters used in image processing. The main difference between them is the way they respond to different frequency ranges.\n\nA band filter responds to a broad range of frequencies, typically between 0.5 and 20 Hz, and is often used for edge detection, image segmentation, or filtering out noise.\n\nA notch filter, on the other hand, responds to a narrow range of frequencies, typically below 0.5 Hz or above 20 Hz, and is often used for noise reduction, image sharpening, or enhancing low-frequency content.\n\n**(d) Mechanism of ringing effect caused by ideal filter**\n\nThe ringing effect, also known as ringing or aliasing, occurs when an ideal filter is applied to an image. The ideal filter is designed to pass all frequencies above a certain cutoff frequency, but it can also introduce artifacts such as ringing or aliasing.\n\nThe ringing effect is caused by the filter's inability to accurately represent the image's frequency content. When the filter passes frequencies below the cutoff frequency, it can introduce a \"ringing\" or \"ring-like\" effect, where the image appears to be \"ringing\" or \"singing\" with an artificial frequency component.\n\n**(e) Scheme for determining the direction of motion from an image degraded by uniform-linear motion blurring**\n\nTo determine the direction of motion from an image degraded by uniform-linear motion blurring, we can use the following scheme:\n\n1. Apply a motion correction filter to the image to remove the uniform-linear motion.\n2. Apply a low-pass filter to the corrected image to remove any remaining high-frequency components.\n3. Use the resulting image as input to a feature extraction algorithm, such as edge detection or texture analysis.\n4. Analyze the extracted features to determine the direction of motion, such as the direction of motion vector or the speed of motion.\n\nThis scheme can be used to determine the direction of motion in various types of images, including videos, images, or 3D data.", "shortest_response": "Here's a brief description of each topic:\n\n**(a) Isopreference curves between crowd and Lena\u2019s face**\n\nIsopreference curves are the spatial frequency distributions of the human visual system. The differences between crowd and Lena's face are as follows:\n\n- Lena's face has a more detailed and textured surface, which results in a higher spatial frequency content in the isopreference curve.\n- Crowds have a more uniform and flat surface, which results in a lower spatial frequency content in the isopreference curve.\n\n**(b) Assumption for the degradation function and the added noise in the degradation model**\n\nThe degradation function typically assumes a Gaussian distribution for the noise, and the added noise is also assumed to be Gaussian.\n\n**(c) Differences between the band filter and the notch filter**\n\n- Band filter: a filter that focuses on a specific range of frequencies, while not affecting other frequencies.\n- Notch filter: a filter that removes all frequencies except for a specific range.\n\n**(d) Mechanism of ringing effect caused by ideal filter**\n\nRinging effect is a phenomenon that occurs when an ideal filter is applied to an image. The ideal filter has infinite bandwidth, which means it can pass all frequencies. When this filter is applied to an image, the image can exhibit ringing effects due to the inability of the filter to completely remove high-frequency components.\n\n**(e) Scheme for determining the direction of motion from an image degraded by uniform-linear motion blurring**\n\nThe scheme for determining the direction of motion from an image degraded by uniform-linear motion blurring involves the following steps:\n\n- Apply the motion blurring filter to the original image.\n- Compute the Fourier transform of the blurred image.\n- Identify the frequency component with the highest magnitude in the Fourier transform, which corresponds to the direction of motion.\n\nThis scheme assumes that the motion blurring filter is non-causal, meaning it cannot see the future motion.", "input_size": 131, "output_sizes": [409, 426, 381, 667, 584, 688, 570, 524, 462, 506], "output_mean": 521.7, "output_std": 100.23, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 435.0, "p50": 515.0, "p75": 580.5, "p99": 686.11}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 7.03635}, {"sample_id": "bd02ae2202405d1f", "prompt_id": "2939d1ecf3353841", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "If keywords were relevant, what keywords be more beneficial?", "longest_response": "If keywords were relevant, here are some alternative keywords that could be more beneficial:\n\n**Product-related keywords:**\n\n1.

It can also be used to describe a state of being in a particular situation or condition.\n\nIn English, s\u1ed1ng is often used as a verb, which means it can be translated to English as \"to live\", \"to be alive\", or \"to exist\". For example:\n\n* \"I love to s\u1ed1ng in the sunshine.\" (I love to live in the sunshine.)\n* \"The tree is s\u1ed1ng in the forest.\" (The tree is alive in the forest.)\n* \"She s\u00f3g to work hard to achieve her goals.\" (She wants to work hard to achieve her goals.)\n\nS\u1ed1ng can also be used as an adjective to describe a person's state of being or a situation:\n\n* \"The s\u1ed1ng of the city is always crowded.\" (The state of the city is always crowded.)\n* \"The s\u00f3g of the country is rich and diverse.\" (The state of the country is rich and diverse.)\n\n**Pronunciation**\n\nThe pronunciation of s\u1ed1ng is /so\u028a\u014b/, which is a combination of the sounds /s/ and /\u014b/. The /s/ sound is a voiced alveolar stop, which means it's made by blocking the airflow in the mouth with the tongue and the alveolar ridge (the area just behind the upper front teeth). The /\u014b/ sound is a voiced velar stop, which means it's made by blocking the airflow in the mouth with the tongue and the velum (the soft palate).\n\n**Forms**\n\n* Noun: S\u1ed1ng (s\u1ed1ng), S\u1ed1ng (s\u00f3g)\n* Verb: S\u1ed1ng (s\u00f3g, s\u00f3g)\n* Adjective: S\u1ed1ng (s\u00f3g)\n* Adverb: Kh\u00f4ng (kh\u00f4ng), Kh\u00f4ng (kh\u00f4ng)\n\n**Related words**\n\n* Sinh (to be born)\n* S\u1ed1ng (to live)\n* S\u1ed1ng (to exist)\n* S\u1ed1ng (to be alive)\n* Sinh (to be born)\n* S\u1ed1ng (to live)\n* S\u1ed1ng (to exist)\n* S\u1ed1ng (to be alive)\n\n**Phrases**\n\n* S\u1ed1ng cu\u1ed9c s\u1ed1ng (to live life)\n* S\u1ed1ng trong t\u00ecnh y\u00eau (to live in love)\n* S\u1ed1ng v\u1edbi gia \u0111\u00ecnh (to live with family)\n* S\u1ed1ng t\u1ef1 do (to live freely)\n\n**Comparison with others**\n\nThe word s\u1ed1ng is similar to sinh (to be born) in that both words refer to the state of being alive. However, sinh is more general and can refer to any living being, while s\u1ed1ng is more specific and typically refers to humans. Additionally, sinh is often used in more formal or poetic contexts, while s\u1ed1ng is often used in more everyday or conversational contexts.\n\n**Vie**\n\nIn Vietnamese, the word s\u1ed1ng is pronounced as /so\u028a\u014b/ and is written as (s\u1ed1ng).\n\n**Laban Dict**\n\nYou can find the word s\u1ed1ng in the Laban dictionary at https://dict.laban.vn/find?query=s\u1ed1ng.\n\n**Examples**\n\nHere are four examples of the word s\u1ed1ng in sentences:\n\n* \"T\u00f4i s\u00f3g trong cu\u1ed9c s\u1ed1ng c\u1ee7a m\u00ecnh.\" (I live in my own life.)\n* \"S\u1ed1ng cu\u1ed9c s\u1ed1ng t\u1ed1t \u0111\u1eb9p nh\u1ea5t c\u00f3 th\u1ec3.\" (To live life to the fullest.)\n* \"T\u00f4i s\u00f3g v\u1edbi gia \u0111\u00ecnh v\u00e0 b\u1ea1n b\u00e8 c\u1ee7a m\u00ecnh.\" (I live with family and friends.)\n* \"S\u1ed1ng t\u1ef1 do l\u00e0 \u0111i\u1ec1u m\u00e0 t\u00f4i mong mu\u1ed1n.\" (Living freely is what I want.)\n\nNote: The examples are in Vietnamese, but the word s\u1ed1ng can be used in other languages as well.", "shortest_response": "**Word:** V\u1ec7 s\u0129\n\n**English explanations and definitions:**\nV\u1ec7 s\u0129 (V\u1ec7 s\u0129) is a noun that refers to a person who serves as a guard or a security officer.

Just so we are on the same page about the proclamation let me share with you how the Church about how the message of Jesus about God is Good News for humanity. Here it is that: \u201cJesus proclaimed the Kingdom of God; a new and definitive intervention by God, with a transforming power equal and even superior to his creation of the world\u201d (GDC 101). First of all I just want to know if you have ever heard a more potent and powerful expression of the Kingdom of God, \u201cwith a transforming power equal and even superior to his creation of the world.\u201d As you know salvation is the central message of the good news. \u201cThis is the great gift of God which is to be considered as comprising not merely liberation from all those things by which man is oppressed, but especially liberation from sin and from the domination of the evil one, a liberation which incorporates that gladness enjoyed by every man who knows God and is known by him, who sees God and who surrenders himself trustingly to him.\u201d This is a good beginning point for what might discuss what would be an \u201cintimate and vital bond of man to God,\u201d so that is a starting point of departure and the scope of our conversion because not all people believe even in this very brief and limited view of the Gospel message proclaiming salvation which is liberation, but also an intimate relationship with God.\n\nAccording to the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Here are at least five reasons why the Gospel might be forgotten, overlooked or even explicitly rejected. I want to know in the comments below if one or more of these attunes might apply to you or may have been your perspective before you believed.\n\nRevolt against evil in the world\nReligious ignorance or indifference\nThe cares and riches of this world\nThe scandal of bad example on the part of believers\nCurrents of thought hostile to religion \nFinally, that attitude of sinful man which makes him hide from God out of fear and flee his call.\n(CCC 29)\n\nLet me know if you are a believer and have ever once identified with one of these six reasons. If you do not believe does one of these six reasons apply to you and if so, which one. Pause, the video and go in the comments and let me know your thoughts. Take a moment to consider which one applies to you then we will discuss a passage from Scriptures and get your thoughts on that. First, of these six just pick one and let me know which one you think most applies to you now or at one time in your life may have been a reason for not believing in the proclamation without getting into any other reasons which one of these do you think relates to you the most. I would actually say after thinking more about it; before I believed I related most to number 2: religious indifference and a good dash of number 3 the cares and riches of the world with a great heaping helping of personal sin. I was not rejecting the Gospel because I was somehow revolting against in the world as reason not to believe, nor did care about scandals or hypocrites. Maybe a little on the prevailing negativity or lack thereof positive towards religion. If I had order these from most likely my attitude was from most to least was 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 1. Mainly, I was just indifferent to it all and didn\u2019t know much of anything, so I really did not care and because of my cares for the world and the things it namely my sinful desires I did not take it seriously. Then of course, I would hide from God out of fear and to flee his call, which I did during the middle part of my journey of faith as I was learning to commit my life to him. I would say now if there is anything that might hinder my faith it could be a revolt against the evil in the world. It sounds strange that what was least important to me before I believed would now be something that I could see making it difficult to believe. I might even say that the scandal and bad example on part of believers could also cause me to struggle in my faith. Oddly enough, I can definitely relate to all this attitudes although I don\u2019t hold any of them now I can see how I could and might have these views and where you might stand in the conversation?\n\nLet me know in the comments below.\n1 / 1", "longest_response": "**Title:** Understanding Why the Gospel Might Be Forgotten or Rejected: A Personal Perspective\n\n**Intro:**\n\nWelcome to our video on why the Gospel might be forgotten or rejected. Today, we're going to explore five potential reasons why someone might not believe in the proclamation of the Gospel. If you're a believer, you might be wondering: which reason most applies to me? Or, if you're not a believer, you might be curious about what might be holding you back.\n\n**The Gospel: A Message of Good News**\n\nThe Gospel is a message of good news that tells us about God's love for humanity. It's about a new and definitive intervention by God, with a transforming power that's equal and superior to his creation of the world. The message of salvation is the central part of the Gospel, and it's about liberation from sin and the domination of evil.\n\n**Five Reasons Why the Gospel Might Be Forgotten or Rejected**\n\n1. **Revolt against evil in the world**: We're living in a world filled with evil, and some people might not believe in the Gospel because they're not convinced that God is actively working to bring about change.\n2. **Religious ignorance or indifference**: Many people don't know much about the Gospel, and they might not see the value in it. They might be more interested in material success or worldly pleasures.\n3. **The cares and riches of this world**: In today's society, people are often focused on accumulating wealth and material possessions, and they might not see the Gospel as relevant to their lives.\n4. **The scandal of bad example on the part of believers**: Unfortunately, some people might not believe in the Gospel because they see bad behavior on the part of believers, such as hypocrisy or selfishness.\n5. **Currents of thought hostile to religion**: The world is full of ideas and perspectives that might not align with the Gospel, and some people might not be receptive to these ideas.\n\n**Personal Perspective: Relating to the Five Reasons**\n\nAs someone who has struggled with these reasons, I can relate to them. I was not convinced by the Gospel because I was indifferent to it all. I didn't know much about it, and I didn't see the value in it. I was also focused on the cares and riches of the world, and I didn't see the Gospel as relevant to my life.\n\nHowever, as I learned more about the Gospel, I began to see the transformative power of God's love. I started to surrender my life to him, and I began to see the scandal of bad example on the part of believers. I realized that I had been hiding from God out of fear and fleeing his call, and I was grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Gospel is a message of good news that's full of hope and promise. It's not just about salvation; it's about a new and definitive intervention by God, with a transforming power that's equal and superior to his creation of the world. If you're struggling with these reasons, I encourage you to take a closer look at the Gospel and see if it's the message that's calling to you.\n\n**Comments:**\n\n1. I completely relate to the idea of being indifferent to the Gospel. I've struggled with this myself, and it's amazing how much of a difference it can make when we start to take it seriously.\n2. I was surprised to see that I related to the idea of being focused on the cares and riches of the world. I've always thought that this was a major obstacle to believing in the Gospel, but I guess it's not as simple as that.\n3. I'm glad to hear that you've been able to surrender your life to God. I've struggled with this myself, and it's a process that takes time and effort. But it's so worth it in the end.\n4. I'm curious, what was the most challenging part of your journey to surrender your life to God? Was there a specific moment or experience that helped you to see the Gospel in a new light?\n5. I'm not sure if I relate to the idea of bad example on the part of believers, but I do think that it's a major obstacle to believing in the Gospel.

In this video, I'll share with you my personal journey and the reasons why I didn't believe in the Gospel at first. I'll also ask you, in the comments below, if you've ever experienced one of these reasons firsthand.\n\n**The Gospel: Good News for Humanity**\n\nThe Church teaches that the Gospel is Good News for humanity, proclaiming the Kingdom of God with a transforming power equal and even superior to his creation of the world. It's a message that liberates us from sin and the evil one, and brings us gladness and trust in God.\n\n**5 Reasons I Didn't Believe:**\n\n1. **Religious Indifference:** I didn't believe in the Gospel because I was indifferent to it. I didn't know much about it, and I didn't care. I was more focused on the cares and riches of the world, and my sinful desires.\n2. **The Cares and Riches of the World:** I was so focused on the material world that I didn't see the Gospel as a message of liberation from sin and the evil one. I was more concerned with the world's problems and my own desires.\n3. **The Scandal of Bad Example on the Part of Believers:** I was aware of the scandals and bad examples on the part of believers, but I didn't see it as a reason to believe. I thought that believers were more concerned with their own sins than with the Gospel.\n4. **The Currents of Thought Hostile to Religion:** I was influenced by negative attitudes towards religion, which made it harder for me to believe.\n5. **The Attitude of Sinful Man:** I hid from God out of fear and fled his call. I thought that if I didn't believe, I could avoid the evil in the world and the scandal of bad example.\n\n**Your Thoughts:**\n\nNow, it's your turn! In the comments below, share with us which reason you think relates to you the most. Was it religious indifference, the cares and riches of the world, the scandal of bad example, or something else? Let's discuss a passage from Scriptures and get your thoughts on it.\n\n**Take a Moment to Reflect:**\n\nTake a moment to reflect on which reason applies to you. Ask yourself, \"What was my attitude towards the Gospel at first?\" and \"How have I changed since then?\" Let's discuss this further in the comments below.\n\n**Join the Conversation:**\n\nLet's start a conversation about why we believe in the Gospel.

This formulation does not imply that the individual explicitly\nderives his preferences from a value function, but only that his preferences can\nbe derived from such a function. Preferences with this property are said to be\nrepresented by the value function. We refer to a value function that represents\npreferences as a utility function.\nDefinition 1.6: Utility function\nFor any set X and preference relation \u00bc on X, the function u : X \u2192 R\nrepresents \u00bc if\nx \u00bc y if and only if u(x) \u2265 u(y ).\nWe say that u is a utility function for \u00bc.\nExample 1.1\nConsider the preference relation \u00bc on the set {a,b, c,d } for which a \u001f b \u223c\nc \u001f d. The function u for which u(a) = 5, u(b) = u(c ) = \u22121, and u(d ) =\n\u221217 is a utility function for \u00bc.\nUnder what conditions can a preference relation be represented by a utility\nfunction? To answer this question, we need another definition.\nDefinition 1.7: Minimal and maximal alternatives\nFor any set X and preference relation \u00bc on X, the alternative x \u2208 X is minimal with respect to \u00bc in X if y \u00bc x for all y \u2208 X and is maximal with respect\nto \u00bc in X if x \u00bc y for all y \u2208 X.\n10 Chapter 1. Preferences and utility\nThe next result shows that every preference relation on a finite set has minimal and maximal members.\nLemma 1.1: Existence of minimal and maximal alternatives\nLet X be a nonempty finite set and let \u00bc be a preference relation on X. At\nleast one member of X is minimal with respect to \u00bc in X and at least one\nmember is maximal.\nProof\nWe prove the result for minimality; the argument for maximality is analogous. We use induction on the number n of members of X. If n = 1 the\nsingle member of X is minimal with respect to \u00bc in X. Assume the result is\ntrue for n \u2212 1; we prove it is true for n. Let y be an arbitrary member of X\nand let x be minimal with respect to \u00bc in X \\{y } (a set with n\u22121 members).\nIf y \u00bc x then x is minimal in X. If not, then x \u00bc y. Take any z \u2208 X \\ {y }.\nBecause x is minimal in X \\ {y }, we have z \u00bc x, so by transitivity z \u00bc y.\nThus y is minimal in X.\nProblem 2b asks you to give an example of a preference relation on an infinite\nset for which there is no minimal or maximal member.\nWe can now show that any preference relation on a finite set can be represented by a utility function.\nProposition 1.1: Representing preference relation by utility function\nEvery preference relation on a finite set can be represented by a utility\nfunction.\nProof\nLet X be a finite set and let \u00bc be a preference relation on X. Let Y0 = X and\ndefine M1 to be the set of alternatives minimal with respect to \u00bc in Y0. By\nLemma 1.1, Y0 is not empty. For k \u2265 1 inductively define Yk = Yk\u22121 \\ Mk\nas long as Yk\u22121 is nonempty, and let Mk+1 be the (nonempty) set of alternatives minimal with respect to \u00bc in Yk. In other words, at every stage remove from the set of remaining alternatives the alternatives minimal with\nrespect to \u00bc.

This formulation does not imply that the individual explicitly\nderives his preferences from a value function, but only that his preferences can\nbe derived from such a function. Preferences with this property are said to be\nrepresented by the value function. We refer to a value function that represents\npreferences as a utility function.\nDefinition 1.6: Utility function\nFor any set X and preference relation \u00bc on X, the function u : X \u2192 R\nrepresents \u00bc if\nx \u00bc y if and only if u(x) \u2265 u(y ).\nWe say that u is a utility function for \u00bc.\nExample 1.1\nConsider the preference relation \u00bc on the set {a,b, c,d } for which a \u001f b \u223c\nc \u001f d. The function u for which u(a) = 5, u(b) = u(c ) = \u22121, and u(d ) =\n\u221217 is a utility function for \u00bc.\nUnder what conditions can a preference relation be represented by a utility\nfunction? To answer this question, we need another definition.\nDefinition 1.7: Minimal and maximal alternatives\nFor any set X and preference relation \u00bc on X, the alternative x \u2208 X is minimal with respect to \u00bc in X if y \u00bc x for all y \u2208 X and is maximal with respect\nto \u00bc in X if x \u00bc y for all y \u2208 X.\n10 Chapter 1. Preferences and utility\nThe next result shows that every preference relation on a finite set has minimal and maximal members.\nLemma 1.1: Existence of minimal and maximal alternatives\nLet X be a nonempty finite set and let \u00bc be a preference relation on X. At\nleast one member of X is minimal with respect to \u00bc in X and at least one\nmember is maximal.\nProof\nWe prove the result for minimality; the argument for maximality is analogous. We use induction on the number n of members of X. If n = 1 the\nsingle member of X is minimal with respect to \u00bc in X. Assume the result is\ntrue for n \u2212 1; we prove it is true for n. Let y be an arbitrary member of X\nand let x be minimal with respect to \u00bc in X \\{y } (a set with n\u22121 members).\nIf y \u00bc x then x is minimal in X. If not, then x \u00bc y. Take any z \u2208 X \\ {y }.\nBecause x is minimal in X \\ {y }, we have z \u00bc x, so by transitivity z \u00bc y.\nThus y is minimal in X.\nProblem 2b asks you to give an example of a preference relation on an infinite\nset for which there is no minimal or maximal member.\nWe can now show that any preference relation on a finite set can be represented by a utility function.\nProposition 1.1: Representing preference relation by utility function\nEvery preference relation on a finite set can be represented by a utility\nfunction.\nProof\nLet X be a finite set and let \u00bc be a preference relation on X. Let Y0 = X and\ndefine M1 to be the set of alternatives minimal with respect to \u00bc in Y0. By\nLemma 1.1, Y0 is not empty. For k \u2265 1 inductively define Yk = Yk\u22121 \\ Mk\nas long as Yk\u22121 is nonempty, and let Mk+1 be the (nonempty) set of alternatives minimal with respect to \u00bc in Yk. In other words, at every stage remove from the set of remaining alternatives the alternatives minimal with\nrespect to \u00bc. (Figure 1.2 illustrates the construction.)\nAs long as Yk is not empty, by Lemma 1.1 the set Mk+1 is not empty.\nBecause X is finite, for some value of K the set YK is empty (but the set1.4 Utility functions)\n\nMany preference relations on infinite sets can also be represented by utility\nfunctions. A simple example is the preference relation \u00bc on the set of nonnegative real numbers defined by x \u00bc y if and only if x \u2265 y, which is represented by\nthe utility function u defined by u(x) = x. However, not all preference relations\non infinite sets can be represented by utility functions. An example is the lexicographic preference relation over the unit square X = {(x1,x2) : x1,x2 \u2208 [0, 1]} for\nwhich the first priority is the first coordinate and the second priority is the second coordinate (so that, for example, (0.3, 0.1) \u001f (0.2, 0.9) \u001f (0.2, 0.8)). (Figure 1.4\nshows the set of alternatives preferred to a given alternative.)\nProposition 1.2: Preference relation not represented by utility function\nThe (lexicographic) preference relation \u00bc on {(x1,x2) : x1,x2 \u2208 [0, 1]} defined by (x1,x2) \u001f (y1,y2) if and only if either (i) x1 > y1 or (ii) x1 = y1 and\nx2 > y2 is not represented by any utility function.\nThe proof of this result requires more mathematical knowledge than the other\narguments in the book.\nProof\nAssume, contrary to the claim, that the function u represents \u00bc. For each\nx \u2208 [0, 1], we have (x, 1) \u001f (x, 0), so that u(x, 1) > u(x, 0). Define a function\nf that assigns to every number x \u2208 [0, 1] a rational number in the interval (u(x, 0),u(x, 1)). Such a number exists because between any two real\nnumbers there is a rational number. The function f is one-to-one since\nif a > b then (a, 0) \u001f (b, 1), so that u(a, 0) > u(b, 1), and hence the interval (u(a, 0),u(a, 1)) from which f (a) is selected does not intersect the\ninterval (u(b, 0),u(b, 1)) from which f (b) is selected. The contradiction igure 1.4 The set of alternatives preferred to (z 1,z 2) according to the lexicographic\npreference relation described in the text is the area shaded blue, excluding the part of\nthe boundary indicated by a dashed line.\nnow follows from Cantor\u2019s diagonal argument, which shows that there is\nno one-to-one function from the set [0, 1] into a countable set (like the set\nof rational numbers).\nIf a utility function represents a given preference relation, then many other\nutility functions do so too. For example, if the function u represents a given preference relation then so does the function 3u \u2212 7 or any other function of the\nform a u + b where a is a positive number. Generally, we have the following result. Note that we define a function f to be increasing if f (x) > f (y ) whenever\nx > y (and nondecreasing if f (x) \u2265 f (y ) whenever x > y ).\nProposition 1.3: Increasing function of utility function is utility function\nLet f : R \u2192 R be an increasing function. If u represents the preference\nrelation \u00bc on X, then so does the function w defined by w(x) = f (u(x)) for\nall x \u2208 X.\nProof\nWe have w(x) \u2265 w(y )", "longest_response": "To answer the question of under what conditions can a preference relation be represented by a utility function, we need to analyze the properties of utility functions and preference relations.\n\n**Definition 1.7: Minimal and maximal alternatives**\n\nFor any set X and preference relation \u00bc on X, the alternative x \u2208 X is minimal with respect to \u00bc in X if y \u00bc x for all y \u2208 X and is maximal with respect to \u00bc in X if x \u00bc y for all y \u2208 X.\n\n**Proposition 1.1: Representing preference relation by utility function**\n\nEvery preference relation on a finite set can be represented by a utility function.\n\n**Proposition 1.2: Preference relation not represented by utility function**\n\nThe (lexicographic) preference relation \u00bc on {(x1,x2) : x1,x2 \u2208 [0, 1]} defined by (x1,x2) \u001f (y1,y2) if and only if either (i) x1 > y1 or (ii) x1 = y1 and x2 > y2 is not represented by any utility function.\n\n**Proposition 1.3: Increasing function of utility function is utility function**\n\nLet f : R \u2192 R be an increasing function.

I was responsible in facilitating team meetings, completing the final project report, and assisting with research and developing a binary search algorithm to satisfy specific conditions provided by the problem. This 4-week project provided me with the opportunity to work with a group of like-minded individuals and utilize my analytical skills to solve problems and showcase my project management skills. During the quarantine in 2021, I took the initiative to complete the CS50 Series Course by Harvard University to learn various programing languages. Using the knowledge from this course, I was able to develop my own version of Black- Jack, Tic Tac Toe, and Hangman using Java and Python. During the winter 2022 semester, I was able to develop a merge sort algorithm (garbage collection included) with C using the knowledge learned from data structures and linked lists.\nThanks to my academic background in electronics and my hands on experience using lab hardware such as oscilloscopes, function generators, and spectrum analyzers, knowledge regarding analog/digital circuit analysis, reading schematics, software architecture, design and debugging, concept regarding power and performance are a few things I crave to learn more about. Additionally, being part of Toronto Met Formula Racing gave me an insight into hardware engineering and gaining technical experience by engaging with other sub-team members within the electrical drivetrain sub-team.\nOverall, I am confident that I will easily transition into the Summer Student role for Human Resources and effectively contribute to the team at METROLINX. I look forward to the opportunity to meet with you personally and arrange a time to further discuss my qualifications. Thank you for your time and consideration.

This method likely retrieves the contents of the local experiment settings file.\n\n**Store Strong Reference**\n\nThe code then calls the `storeStrong` method on the `ExperimentServiceController` class, passing the contents of the file as an argument. This method likely stores the contents of the file as a strong reference.\n\n**Retain Autoreleased Reference**\n\nThe code then calls the `retainAutoreleasedReturnValue` method on the `ExperimentServiceController` class, passing the contents of the file as an argument. This method likely retains the contents of the file as an autoreleased reference.\n\n**Release Autoreleased Reference**\n\nThe code then calls the `release` method on the `ExperimentServiceController` class, passing the contents of the file as an argument. This method likely releases the autoreleased reference.\n\n**Store Strong Reference (again)**\n\nThe code then calls the `storeStrong` method on the `ExperimentServiceController` class, passing the contents of the file as an argument. This method likely stores the contents of the file as a strong reference.\n\n**Autorelease Return Value**\n\nThe code then calls the `autoreleaseReturnValue` method on the `ExperimentServiceController` class, passing the contents of the file as an argument. This method likely returns an autoreleased reference to the contents of the file.\n\n**Cleanup**\n\nThe code then pops the stack frame back onto the stack, effectively cleaning up the stack.\n\nIn summary, this code appears to be a part of an Objective-C implementation that retrieves and stores the local experiment settings for the current application, and then releases the contents of the file as an autoreleased reference.", "input_size": 2064, "output_sizes": [1775, 15001, 15001, 539, 15001, 1777, 15001, 15001, 15001, 10538], "output_mean": 10463.5, "output_std": 6107.21, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 3967.25, "p50": 15001.0, "p75": 15001.0, "p99": 15001.0}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 574.53643}, {"sample_id": "e65cb98e9123fcf7", "prompt_id": "61962d9e534da37e", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "It did not make a new chat in my chat history.", "longest_response": "I'm here to help, and I'm sorry to hear that I didn't make a new chat in your chat history.

However, you'll need to create a custom solution to handle the payment processing and account creation logic, as WordPress plugins don't directly support these features.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the steps you can take:\n\n1. **Integrate a payment gateway**: Choose a payment gateway that supports WordPress, such as Stripe, PayPal, or Square. You'll need to set up a payment gateway API key and configure it in your WordPress plugin.\n2. **Create a custom plugin**: Create a custom WordPress plugin that handles account creation and payment processing. This plugin will need to interact with your Next.js 13 headless CMS to store user data and handle payment processing.\n3. **Use Next.js API routes**: Use Next.js API routes to handle user requests, such as creating a new account or processing payments. You can use the `next/api` API to create new users and process payments.\n4. **Integrate with WordPress**: Use the WordPress REST API to interact with your WordPress plugin and store user data. You can use the `wp_create_user` and `wp_update_user` functions to create new users and update existing user data.\n\nHere's an example of how you can create a custom plugin to handle account creation and payment processing:\n```javascript\n// accountCreation.js\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';\nimport { WordPress } from 'wp-core';\nimport { Stripe } from'stripe';\n\nconst wordpress = new WordPress();\nconst stripe = new Stripe('YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY');\n\nexport default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  if (req.method === 'POST') {\n    const { name, email, password } = req.body;\n\n    // Create a new user in WordPress\n    const createUser = async () => {\n      try {\n        const user = await wordpress.createUser({\n          name,\n          email,\n          password,\n        });\n        return user;\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error(error);\n        return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error creating user' });\n      }\n    };\n\n    // Create a new payment in Stripe\n    const createPayment = async () => {\n      try {\n        const payment = await stripe.createPayment({\n          amount: 100, // Example amount\n          currency: 'usd',\n          payment_method_types: ['card'],\n        });\n        return payment;\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error(error);\n        return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error creating payment' });\n      }\n    };\n\n    // Create a new user and add them to the database\n    const user = await createUser();\n    const payment = await createPayment();\n    await wordpress.updateUser(user.id, {\n      email: user.email,\n    });\n    await wordpress.addPayment(user.id, payment.id);\n\n    res.status(201).json({ message: 'User created and payment added' });\n  } else {\n    res.status(405).json({ message: 'Method not allowed' });\n  }\n}\n```\n```javascript\n// paymentProcessing.js\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';\nimport { WordPress } from 'wp-core';\nimport { Stripe } from'stripe';\n\nconst wordpress = new WordPress();\nconst stripe = new Stripe('YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY');\n\nexport default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  if (req.method === 'POST') {\n    const { amount, currency, paymentMethod } = req.body;\n\n    // Create a new payment in Stripe\n    const payment = await stripe.createPayment({\n      amount,\n      currency,\n      payment_method_types: [paymentMethod],\n    });\n\n    // Store the payment in the database\n    const paymentId = payment.id;\n    await wordpress.addPayment(paymentId);\n\n    res.status(201).json({ message: 'Payment created' });\n  } else {\n    res.status(405).json({ message: 'Method not allowed' });\n  }\n}\n```\n```javascript\n// accountCreationHandler.js\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';\nimport { WordPress } from 'wp-core';\nimport { Stripe } from'stripe';\n\nconst wordpress = new WordPress();\nconst stripe = new Stripe('YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY');\n\nexport default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  if (req.method === 'POST') {\n    const { name, email, password } = req.body;\n\n    // Create a new user in WordPress\n    const createUser = async () => {\n      try {\n        const user = await wordpress.createUser({\n          name,\n          email,\n          password,\n        });\n        return user;\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error(error);\n        return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error creating user' });\n      }\n    };\n\n    // Create a new payment in Stripe\n    const createPayment = async () => {\n      try {\n        const payment = await stripe.createPayment({\n          amount: 100, // Example amount\n          currency: 'usd',\n          payment_method_types: ['card'],\n        });\n        return payment;\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error(error);\n        return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error creating payment' });\n      }\n    };\n\n    // Create a new user and add them to the database\n    const user = await createUser();\n    const payment = await createPayment();\n    await wordpress.updateUser(user.id, {\n      email: user.email,\n    });\n    await wordpress.addPayment(user.id, payment.id);\n\n    res.status(201).json({ message: 'User created and payment added' });\n  } else {\n    res.status(405).json({ message: 'Method not allowed' });\n  }\n}\n```\nTo use this custom plugin in your Next.js 13 headless CMS, you'll need to:\n\n1. Create a new WordPress plugin that uses the `accountCreation.js` file.\n2. Install the `stripe` plugin in WordPress.\n3. Configure the `stripe` plugin to use the `accountCreation.js` file.\n4. Create a new endpoint in your Next.js 13 headless CMS that calls the `accountCreationHandler.js` file to create a new user and add a payment.\n\nHere's an example of how you can create a new endpoint in your Next.js 13 headless CMS:\n```javascript\n// pages/api/users.js\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';\nimport { WordPress } from 'wp-core';\nimport { Stripe } from'stripe';\n\nconst wordpress = new WordPress();\nconst stripe = new Stripe('YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY');\n\nexport default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  if (req.method === 'POST') {\n    const { name, email, password } = req.body;\n\n    // Create a new user in WordPress\n    const createUser = async () => {\n      try {\n        const user = await wordpress.createUser({\n          name,\n          email,\n          password,\n        });\n        return user;\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error(error);\n        return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error creating user' });\n      }\n    };\n\n    // Create a new payment in Stripe\n    const createPayment = async () => {\n      try {\n        const payment = await stripe.createPayment({\n          amount: 100, // Example amount\n          currency: 'usd',\n          payment_method_types: ['card'],\n        });\n        return payment;\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error(error);\n        return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error creating payment' });\n      }\n    };\n\n    // Create a new user and add them to the database\n    const user = await createUser();\n    const payment = await createPayment();\n    await wordpress.updateUser(user.id, {\n      email: user.email,\n    });\n    await wordpress.addPayment(user.id, payment.id);\n\n    res.status(201).json({ message: 'User created and payment added' });\n  } else {\n    res.status(405).json({ message: 'Method not allowed' });\n  }\n}\n```\n```javascript\n// pages/api/users.js\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';\nimport { WordPress } from 'wp-core';\nimport { Stripe } from'stripe';\n\nconst wordpress = new WordPress();\nconst stripe = new Stripe('YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY');\n\nexport default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  if (req.method === 'POST') {\n    const { amount, currency, paymentMethod } = req.body;\n\n    // Create a new payment in Stripe\n    const payment = await stripe.createPayment({\n      amount,\n      currency,\n      payment_method_types: [paymentMethod],\n    });\n\n    // Store the payment in the database\n    const paymentId = payment.id;\n    await wordpress.addPayment(paymentId);\n\n    res.status(201).json({ message: 'Payment created' });\n  } else {\n    res.status(405).json({ message: 'Method not allowed' });\n  }\n}\n```\nThis is just a basic example to get you started. You'll need to modify the code to fit your specific requirements and handle errors and edge cases. Additionally, you'll need to configure the `stripe` plugin to use the `accountCreationHandler.js` file.", "shortest_response": "To manage users creating their account and making payments using WordPress plugins in a Next.js 13 application, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Use a WordPress REST API wrapper**: You can use a WordPress REST API wrapper like WP REST API (WP-REST) or WordPress REST API (WP-REST) to interact with the WordPress API and perform actions like creating users and making payments. These wrappers provide a set of APIs that allow you to interact with the WordPress API without requiring WordPress to be installed on your Next.js app.\n\n2. **Use a third-party payment gateway**: You can use a third-party payment gateway like Stripe, PayPal, or Square to handle payments directly within your Next.js app. These gateways provide APIs that allow you to process payments and handle transactions.\n\n3. **Use a custom Next.js API**: You can create a custom API endpoint in your Next.js app that interacts with the WordPress REST API or uses a third-party payment gateway. This approach requires more development effort, but it allows you to manage user account creation and payments directly within your app.\n\n4. **Use a Headless CMS with a WordPress REST API**: If you're already using a Headless CMS like Strapi or Prismic, you can use the WordPress REST API to interact with the WordPress API. This approach requires integrating the Headless CMS with the WordPress API, which can be more complex.\n\nIn general, it's recommended to use a WordPress REST API wrapper or a third-party payment gateway to manage user account creation and payments, as they provide a more straightforward and secure way to handle these tasks. However, if you have a specific use case or requirements, using a custom API or Headless CMS with a WordPress REST API might be a viable option.\n\nHere are some pros and cons of each approach:\n\n**WordPress REST API wrapper:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Easy to use and integrate\n* Provides a set of APIs for various actions\n* Can be used with other WordPress plugins and themes\n\nCons:\n\n* May require additional setup and configuration\n* Limited control over the WordPress API\n\n**Third-party payment gateway:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Provides a secure and reliable payment processing system\n* Can be integrated with other payment gateways\n* Offers various payment methods and options\n\nCons:\n\n* Requires additional setup and configuration\n* May have additional fees or charges\n\n**Custom API:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Allows for more control over the API and its interactions with the WordPress API\n* Can be used to create a custom API endpoint for specific use cases\n* May require less setup and configuration\n\nCons:\n\n* Requires more development effort and expertise\n* May be more complex to integrate with the WordPress API\n\nUltimately, the choice of approach depends on your specific use case, requirements, and expertise. If you're new to Next.js and WordPress, using a WordPress REST API wrapper or a third-party payment gateway might be a good starting point. If you have more advanced requirements or need more control over the API, using a custom API or Headless CMS with a WordPress REST API might be a better option.", "input_size": 75, "output_sizes": [895, 743, 1139, 632, 1057, 619, 1123, 1057, 1280, 1950], "output_mean": 1049.5, "output_std": 368.1, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 781.0, "p50": 1057.0, "p75": 1135.0, "p99": 1889.7}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 21.57605}, {"sample_id": "418dbc2f0387b3ba", "prompt_id": "364d699254d55eaf", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "What kind of code is this? \n\nprecision highp float;\nuniform float time;\nuniform vec2 resolution;\nvarying vec3 fPosition;\nvarying vec3 fNormal;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n gl\\_FragColor = vec4(fNormal, 1.0);\n}", "longest_response": "This code is written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) and is specifically designed for rendering 3D graphics on the GPU.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n- `precision highp float;`: This line specifies the precision of the floating-point numbers being used in the code.

This comes down to two main problems for users: Do they have permission to use that underlying work, and will the artist or writer be compensated for that use.\nIn an interview [at the Upfront Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-ffIaLq1RQ&list=PLavjJa4-6tbpl3YYLMbulQSTDtThEr6X9&index=9) earlier this month, [Adobe\u2019s Scott Belsky](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/02/adobes-scott-belsky-talks-generative-ai-and-why-its-not-going-to-end-up-like-web3/) talked about the concerns that enterprise clients have around using content generated with this technology. \u201cA lot of our very big enterprise customers are very concerned about using generative AI without understanding how it was trained. They don\u2019t see it as viable for commercial use,\u201d he said at the time.\nThat was before Adobe had announced its own generative AI product. Just this morning the company released a beta of a new generative AI product [called Firefly](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/21/adobe-firefly-generative-ai/), and Adobe\u2019s president of digital media, David Wadhwani promised that companies needn\u2019t worry about the sourcing, and that artists would be taken care of, as well.\nIn an interview with [CNBC\u2019s Jon Fortt this morning](https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:7043929300810559488/), Wadhwani stated that the images being used in Firefly come from the company\u2019s own library. \u201cWe have the ability now to train on hundreds of millions of pieces of content that are fully licensed and are going to produce generative output that is safe for commercial use,\u201d he said.\nThe flip side of that is how the artist whose work is being used will be compensated.\n\u201cWe want to be very clear that we are doing this in a way that will ultimately be commercially good for them. And we\u2019re committing to making sure that we compensate them for revenues generated from Firefly \u2013 and we\u2019ll be releasing more of those details as we come out of the Firefly beta in the months ahead,\u201d Wadhwani told Fortt.\nThe devil will surely be in the details there, and artists will be watching closely to see if the company does indeed compensate them fairly. Wadhwani indicated they are working directly with the artists who contribute to Adobe Stock to figure out how this going to work in practice.\n\u201cFirst and foremost we want to do this in concert and in conversation with every one that is a contributor to the Adobe Stock. So we are reaching out. We\u2019ve already started conversations with the broad base of creators that are contributing, and we\u2019re not ready to state what we\u2019re going to do when we come out of beta because we\u2019re still learning. The most important thing is that we\u2019re committed to making sure that as we go through this process, we want to create more opportunity for the breadth of people who are contributing. And we think we can do that across the large contributors and the long tail,\u201d he said.\n\n> [Is generative AI really ready for the enterprise?](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/12/is-generative-ai-really-ready-for-the-enterprise/)\n> \n> \n\nHe says that ultimately, everybody should win because there will be so much more demand for content, and he believes that this can be good for both Adobe to attract new customers with less artistic skill to its platform, as well as the stock artists whose work is being used as a basis to generate new pieces.\n\u201cSo in that world where content becomes such a fuel for growth, we think that there\u2019s an opportunity to leverage generative technology and Adobe Stock and the broad base of contributors to make sure that they are making more money and being compensated for the incredible work that they\u2019re doing for this entire supply chain of content.\u201d\nTime will tell if that\u2019s the case.", "longest_response": "**L'avenir de l'artiste et l'acc\u00e8s aux contenus g\u00e9n\u00e9ratifs : un d\u00e9fi \u00e0 relever**\n\nLa technologie de g\u00e9n\u00e9ration d'images a d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9volutionn\u00e9 l'industrie artistique et la cr\u00e9ation de contenus.

In front of me there were gigantic mountains covered with green trees and a lot of the whitest snow I've seen. In the dark water I could see the reflection of what was in front of me. That day the sky was pretty clear but still I could see some little clouds on the big blue surface.

Here's a breakdown of what you've done well and some suggestions for improvement:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Imagery:** You've created a strong visual image with your description of the mountains, trees, and snow. Your use of sensory details like \"green trees\" and \"whitest snow\" helps the reader visualize the scene.\n2. **Emotional connection:** Your description conveys a sense of awe and wonder, making the reader feel like they're experiencing the same moment.\n3. **Details:** You've included specific details like the \"little clouds on the big blue surface\" and the \"sharp top of the mountains,\" which add depth and texture to your description.\n\n**Suggestions for improvement:**\n\n1. **Transitions:** Consider adding transitional phrases or sentences to connect your ideas between paragraphs. This will help the reader follow your narrative and create a smoother flow.\n2. **Sentence structure:** Your text is mostly simple sentences, which can make it feel a bit flat. Try mixing in some compound or complex sentences to create more interest and variety.\n3. **Specificity:** While your description is engaging, it's a bit vague. Consider adding more specific details about the weather, the water conditions, or the sensations you experienced while kayaking.\n4. **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying \"I could of sit there for hours and hours,\" try to show the reader what you mean through descriptive language. For example, \"As I paddled, the warm sun on my skin, the gentle lapping of the water against the canoe, and the sound of birds chirping in the trees created a sense of serenity.\"\n5. **Tone:** While your description is descriptive, it's also a bit introspective and contemplative. Consider adding more dialogue or a sense of excitement to create a more dynamic tone.\n\nHere's an example of how you could revise your text to address these suggestions:\n\n\"As I sat on the stairs, I gazed out at the breathtaking landscape unfolding before me. The sky above was a brilliant blue, with just a few wispy clouds drifting lazily across the horizon. The mountains, towering above me, seemed to stretch up to the heavens, their peaks hidden in a veil of white snow. The trees, a vibrant green, stood tall and proud, their leaves rustling softly in the breeze. As I paddled through the calm waters, the orange and gray lifesaver floating beside me, I felt a sense of peace wash over me.

Try to show these emotions and sensations through your descriptions instead of stating them outright.\n2. **Use more descriptive language:** While your descriptions are generally good, there are a few places where you could use more descriptive language to make the scene feel even more vivid. For example, instead of saying \"the sky was pretty clear,\" you could say \"the sky was a brilliant blue, with just a few wispy clouds scattered across its surface.\"\n3. **Vary sentence structure:** Your text is written mainly in simple sentences, which can make it feel a bit flat at times. Try mixing in some more complex sentences or using different sentence structures to create more interest and variety.\n4. **Consider a stronger opening:** Your opening sentence is a great start, but you might want to consider making it a bit more impactful.

In PHP, the Worker Limit is indeed the number of concurrent requests that the server can handle simultaneously. This is typically implemented through a combination of PHP's built-in features, such as the `exec` function and the `fopen` function, and the operating system's limits.\n\nWhen you use `exec` to execute a PHP script, it spawns a new process, which is then executed by the operating system. Each new process is a separate thread, and the operating system limits the number of threads it can create. This is known as the \"thread pool\" or \"worker pool\".\n\nThe Worker Limit is usually implemented as a per-process limit, meaning that each process has its own limit. This means that even if you have multiple PHP scripts running concurrently, the total number of concurrent requests is still capped by the Worker Limit per process.\n\nFor example, if your PHP script uses `exec` to execute another script, and that script uses `exec` again, the total number of concurrent requests is still limited by the Worker Limit per process.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate this:\n```php\n// Create two PHP scripts\n$script1 = \"echo 'Hello World!';\";\n$script2 = \"echo 'Hello World!';\";\n\n// Execute the scripts concurrently\n$worker = new Worker($script1);\n$worker->onmessage = function($event) {\n  echo $event.data;\n};\n\n$worker2 = new Worker($script2);\n$worker2->onmessage = function($event) {\n  echo $event.data;\n};\n\n// Wait for both workers to finish\n$worker->onmessage = function($event) {\n  $worker->close();\n};\n\n$worker2->onmessage = function($event) {\n  $worker->close();\n};\n```\nIn this example, the total number of concurrent requests is limited by the Worker Limit per process. Even if we have two PHP scripts running concurrently, the total number of requests is still limited to 2.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Worker Limit can be adjusted by setting the `php_worker_limit` environment variable or by using the `worker_threads` extension in PHP 7.2 and later versions.", "shortest_response": "No, it's not exactly the number of requests the server can handle concurrently. The PHP Worker Limit is actually the maximum number of worker threads that can be used to handle a single request. \n\nWhen you use the `worker` or `worker_threads` extension in PHP, it creates multiple worker threads to handle requests. Each worker thread can handle a single request concurrently, but the total number of requests that can be handled concurrently is limited by the number of available CPU cores and the PHP Worker Limit.\n\nThe PHP Worker Limit is usually set to a value between 2 and 20, depending on the PHP version and the web server configuration. When the worker limit is reached, the web server will start to reject new requests and may slow down or even crash the application.\n\nSo, while the worker limit is related to the number of concurrent requests, it's not the same thing. The worker limit is a separate concept that controls the number of worker threads used to handle requests, whereas the PHP Worker Limit is a limit on the total number of concurrent requests that can be handled.", "input_size": 65, "output_sizes": [347, 447, 216, 447, 224, 354, 247, 292, 417, 389], "output_mean": 338.0, "output_std": 84.39, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 258.25, "p50": 350.5, "p75": 410.0, "p99": 447.0}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 4.5808}, {"sample_id": "802dada8eb24b931", "prompt_id": "5cbb45b63a86d256", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "The most recent ad (released January 2023) is set in an fictional time where people are struggling to define what it means to be Australian but, ironically, some find it very easy to define what is Un-Australian", "longest_response": "In this alternate reality, the struggle to define what it means to be Australian is a pressing concern.

This extension uses the `chrome extension` API to access the browser's URL bar and perform a search.\n\n**manifest.json**\n```json\n{\n  \"manifest_version\": 2,\n  \"name\": \"Tezos Address Linker\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"description\": \"Links Tezos addresses to tzkt.io\",\n  \"content_scripts\": [\n    {\n      \"matches\": [\"*://*/*\"],\n      \"js\": [\"contentScript.js\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"permissions\": [\"activeTab\"]\n}\n```\n\n**contentScript.js**\n```javascript\n// Get the URL bar\nconst urlBar = document.querySelector('body > #urlBar');\n\n// Add an event listener to the URL bar\nurlBar.addEventListener('input', function() {\n  // Get the input value\n  const inputValue = this.value;\n\n  // Use a regular expression to match Tezos addresses\n  const regex = /^[0-9a-f]{40,42}$/;\n  if (regex.test(inputValue)) {\n    // Get the Tezos address\n    const address = inputValue;\n\n    // Use the `fetch` API to make a GET request to tzkt.io\n    fetch(`https://tzkt.io/${address}`)\n     .then(response => response.text())\n     .then(text => {\n        // Update the URL bar with the linked address\n        this.value = text;\n      })\n     .catch(error => {\n        console.error(error);\n      });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The extension adds a content script to the page, which listens for changes to the URL bar.\n2. When the URL bar changes, the content script gets the new input value.\n3. The content script uses a regular expression to match Tezos addresses in the input value.\n4. If a match is found, the content script makes a GET request to tzkt.io using the `fetch` API.\n5. The response from tzkt.io is then updated in the URL bar.\n\n**Note:** This extension only links addresses that are exactly 40 characters long. If you want to link addresses of any length, you'll need to modify the regular expression accordingly.\n\n**Example use case:**\n\n1. Open a browser with the Tezos extension installed.\n2. Type a Tezos address in the URL bar, such as `1Bw4dR5xP3iX7eZr9c8aF9vJGkT7i`.\n3. The address will be linked to tzkt.io in real-time.\n\nPlease note that this is a basic example and may not work for all Tezos addresses. You may need to modify the regular expression or add additional checks to suit your specific use case. Additionally, tzkt.io may have usage limits or restrictions on external links, so be sure to check their terms of service before using this extension.", "input_size": 61, "output_sizes": [908, 662, 860, 938, 975, 630, 622, 661, 826, 697], "output_mean": 777.9, "output_std": 130.49, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 661.25, "p50": 761.5, "p75": 896.0, "p99": 971.67}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 9.99792}, {"sample_id": "a7c1abca83e6a7ef", "prompt_id": "4e45675286fbb6eb", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "i need to prepare for software engineering interviews. can you break it down to smaller tasks so it's easier for me to follow?", "longest_response": "Preparing for software engineering interviews can be a challenging but rewarding process.

Here's a high-level overview of how you can achieve this:\n\n**Step 1: Create a Dockerfile for each Vhost**\n\nCreate a separate Dockerfile for each Vhost, which will contain the necessary configuration for that specific Vhost. You can use the `docker run` command to create a new container for each Vhost.\n\n```dockerfile\n# Create a new Vhost container\nFROM nginx:alpine\n\n# Set the Vhost configuration\nCOPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\nCOPY vhost.conf /etc/nginx/vhost.conf\n\n# Set the port to listen on\nEXPOSE 80\n\n# Run the Nginx web server\nCMD [\"nginx\", \"-g\", \"daemon off;\"]\n```\n\nCreate a `nginx.conf` file inside the Vhost directory with the following contents:\n```nginx\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name example.com;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://example-vhost:80;\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCreate a `vhost.conf` file inside the Vhost directory with the following contents:\n```nginx\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name example.com;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://example-vhost:80;\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2: Create an ingress resource for each Vhost**\n\nCreate an ingress resource for each Vhost using the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io` resource type. You can use the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io` resource type to create a custom ingress resource for each Vhost.\n\n```yml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: example-vhost-ingress\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - host: example.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        backend:\n          serviceName: example-vhost\n          servicePort: 80\n```\n\nCreate an `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io` resource for each Vhost using the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io` resource type. You can use the following command to create an ingress resource for each Vhost:\n\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f example-vhost-ingress.yaml\n```\n\n**Step 3: Create a service for each Vhost**\n\nCreate a service for each Vhost using the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io` resource type. You can use the following command to create a service for each Vhost:\n\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f example-vhost-service.yaml\n```\n\n**Step 4: Create a route for each Vhost**\n\nCreate a route for each Vhost using the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io` resource type. You can use the following command to create a route for each Vhost:\n\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f example-vhost-route.yaml\n```\n\nHere is the complete example:\n```yml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: example-vhost-ingress\nspec:\n  rules:\n  -

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n**Step 1: Create a Dockerfile**\n\nCreate a new file named `Dockerfile` in the root of your project. This file will contain the instructions to build your Docker image.\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM nginx:alpine\n\n# Set the working directory inside the container\nWORKDIR /var/www/html\n\n# Copy the static files from the host machine\nCOPY. /var/www/html\n\n# Expose the port for the ingress\nEXPOSE 80\n\n# Run the command to start the ingress\nCMD [\"nginx\", \"-g\", \"daemon off;\"]\n```\n\nThis Dockerfile uses the official Nginx image and sets the working directory inside the container, copies the static files from the host machine, exposes port 80 for the ingress, and runs the command to start the ingress.\n\n**Step 2: Create a Docker Compose file**\n\nCreate a new file named `docker-compose.yml` in the root of your project. This file will contain the instructions to build and run your Docker containers.\n\n```yml\nversion: '3'\n\nservices:\n  nginx:\n    image: nginx:alpine\n    ports:\n      - \"80:80\"\n    volumes:\n      -./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro\n      -./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.default:ro\n```\n\nThis Docker Compose file uses the official Nginx image and exposes port 80 for the ingress. It also mounts the `nginx.conf` file to the container as a volume.\n\n**Step 3: Create a nginx.conf file**\n\nCreate a new file named `nginx.conf` in the root of your project. This file will contain the configuration for the Nginx server.\n\n```nginx\nhttp {\n    server {\n        listen 80;\n        server_name example.com;\n\n        location / {\n            proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;\n            proxy_set_header Host $host;\n            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis `nginx.conf` file sets up a proxy server that forwards requests from the local network to the container at port 8080.\n\n**Step 4: Run the Docker containers**\n\nRun the following command to start the Docker containers:\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\nThis command starts the Docker containers in detached mode.\n\n**Step 5: Access the containers via the ingress**\n\nYou can access the containers via the ingress using a local network. To do this, you need to create a service in your local network. Here's an example using the `docker-compose` command:\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\nThis command starts the Docker containers in detached mode. You can then access the containers via the ingress using a local network:\n\n```bash\nhttp://localhost:8080\n```\n\nReplace `example.com` with the domain name of your application.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a tool like `docker-compose exec` to access the containers:\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose exec -t my-app nginx\n```\n\nThis command starts the Docker containers in detached mode and allows you to access them using the `nginx` command.\n\nBy following these steps, you can have multiple VHosts inside a Docker container and create ingress for each account to access them via a local network.", "input_size": 63, "output_sizes": [903, 15001, 1075, 1420, 933, 15001, 1246, 2933, 716, 949], "output_mean": 4017.7, "output_std": 5523.29, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 937.0, "p50":

Without the actual code, it's difficult to provide an exact Big O efficiency.\n\nHowever, based on the method's name and the typical structure of such methods, here are some possible Big O complexities:\n\n1. **Simple comparison**: If the `hasMatchingData` method involves a simple comparison (e.g., checking if two values are equal), the time complexity would be O(1) or O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the set.\n\n2. **String matching**: If the method uses a string matching algorithm (e.g., substring matching), the time complexity would be O(n), where n is the length of the longer string.\n\n3. **Hash-based lookup**: If the method uses a hash-based lookup (e.g., using a hash table), the time complexity would be O(1) or O(n), where n is the number of elements in the set.\n\n4. **Sorting**: If the method sorts the data before checking for matches, the time complexity would be O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the set.\n\n5. **Nested loops**: If the method involves nested loops (e.g., iterating over the data and another data set), the time complexity would be O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the data sets.\n\nTo provide a more accurate estimate, I'd need the actual code for the `hasMatchingData` method. However, here's a simple example of how you might implement it:\n\n```python\ndef hasMatchingData(data1, data2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if data1 and data2 have any matching elements.\n\n    Args:\n        data1 (list): The first data set.\n        data2 (list): The second data set.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if data1 and data2 have any matching elements, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a set from data1 for O(n) time complexity\n    data1_set = set(data1)\n    \n    # Iterate over data2 and check for matches\n    for item in data2:\n        # If an item is found in data1_set, return True\n        if item in data1_set:\n            return True\n    \n    # If no matches are found, return False\n    return False\n```\n\nIn this example, the time complexity of the `hasMatchingData` method is O(n) because it iterates over the data set `data2` once. The time complexity of creating a set from `data1` is also O(n) because sets are typically implemented as hash tables, which have an average time complexity of O(1) for lookup operations.", "shortest_response": "The Big O efficiency of the `hasMatchingData` method in the provided context is likely to be O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `data` array.\n\nThis is because the `hasMatchingData` method likely iterates over the entire `data` array to check for each element if it matches the given data. In the worst-case scenario, it would have to iterate over all elements in the array.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps involved in the `hasMatchingData` method:\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the `data` array, respectively.\n2. Initialize a variable `match` to store the result (true or false).\n3. While `low` is less than or equal to `high`:\n   a. Compare the current element in the `data` array (`data[low]`) with the given data (`data[match]`).\n   b. If they match, set `match` to true and break the loop.\n   c. Otherwise, increment `low` by 1.\n4. Return the value of `match`, which indicates whether any element in the `data` array matches the given data.\n\nIn terms of Big O notation, the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `data` array. This is because the algorithm iterates over the entire array once.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the `low`, `high`, and `match` variables.", "input_size": 48, "output_sizes": [451, 563, 445, 436, 399, 382, 392, 337, 437, 473], "output_mean": 431.5, "output_std": 57.99, "output_percentiles":

"longest_response": "In Lua, you can't directly access the parent of a table using `v.ParentName`. This is because tables in Lua are not objects, and objects have a `__index` property that allows you to access their parent.\n\nHowever, you can use a workaround by using a table as a proxy to access the parent. Here's an example:\n\n```lua\nlocal v = { a = 1, b = 2 }\n\nlocal proxy = v.__index\nlocal parent = v.__proto__\n\nprint(proxy.a)  -- prints 1\nprint(parent.b)  -- prints 2\n```\n\nIn this example, `v.__index` is a proxy that allows you to access the parent of `v`. `v.__proto__` is the parent of `v` in the Lua stack.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a metatable to access the parent:\n\n```lua\nlocal v = { a = 1, b = 2 }\n\nlocal m = v.__metatable\nlocal parent = m.__proto__\n\nprint(parent.a)  -- prints 1\nprint(parent.b)  -- prints 2\n```\n\nNote that this approach assumes that `v` is a table that has a `__metatable` property.
