It uses a 2-level bid to show a strong hand with a 5-card major, and a 1-level bid to show a strong hand with a 5-card minor. The 2-level bid also forces a partner to bid a major, while the 1-level bid does not.\n2. **Acol**: This system is a variation of the 2/1 system, but it uses a 1-level bid to show a strong hand with a 5-card major.

These techniques created a sense of drama and tension, which added to the film's impact.\n3. **Themes and Social Commentary**: Citizen Kane is a powerful commentary on the corrupting influence of power, the decay of the American Dream, and the media's role in shaping public opinion. The film's themes are still relevant today, making it a timeless classic.\n4. **Performances**: The film features outstanding performances from Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, Everett Sloane, and Dorothy Comingore, among others. Welles's portrayal of Charles Foster Kane is particularly notable, as he brings depth and nuance to the character.\n5. **Technical Achievements**: Citizen Kane was a technical marvel in its time, with innovative use of sound, lighting, and editing.

Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. **Innovative Storytelling**: Citizen Kane was a pioneering film in terms of narrative structure. Director Orson Welles and writer Herman J. Mankiewicz employed a non-linear storytelling style, using multiple narrators and flashbacks to tell the story of Charles Foster Kane. This innovative approach has influenced countless films since.\n\n2. **Visual and Cinematographic Style**: Citizen Kane was a groundbreaking film in terms of visual and cinematographic style. Welles and his cinematographer, Gregg Toland, used deep focus, low-angle shots, and innovative camera movements to create a visually stunning and immersive experience.\n\n3. **Themes and Social Commentary**: Citizen Kane explores themes of power, corruption, and the American Dream, which were highly relevant to the time period in which it was made. The film's critique of capitalism and the excesses of the wealthy elite resonated with audiences and continues to be relevant today.\n\n4. **Influence on Film Industry**: Citizen Kane's influence on the film industry cannot be overstated.

It has been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry and has won numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.\n\n7. **Timeless Relevance**: Despite being released over 80 years ago, Citizen Kane remains a timeless and thought-provoking film that continues to resonate with audiences today. Its themes of power, corruption, and the search for meaning are as relevant now as they were in the 1940s.\n\nOverall, Citizen Kane's status as the \"best film\" is due to its innovative storytelling, visual and cinematographic style, themes and social commentary, influence on the film industry, cultural significance, awards and recognition, and timeless relevance.", "input_size": 44, "output_sizes": [647, 619, 619, 590, 542, 555, 588, 583, 548, 580], "output_mean": 587.1, "output_std": 32.08, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 561.25, "p50": 585.5, "p75": 611.75, "p99": 644.48}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 15.26542}, {"sample_id": "19a3b7009ac96260", "prompt_id": "ffc2991b2034be42", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What is a wallet used for?", "longest_response": "A wallet is a small, portable container used to carry and store various types of personal items, including:\n\n1. **Money**: Cash, bills, and coins.\n2. **Credit cards**: Debit cards, credit cards, and prepaid cards.\n3. **Identification**: Driver's license, passport, or other government-issued ID.\n4. **Photos**: Personal photos or identification cards.\n5. **Business cards**: For professional or networking purposes.\n6. **Membership cards**: Loyalty cards, rewards cards, or membership cards for clubs or organizations.\n7. **Receipts**: Temporary storage for receipts from purchases.\n8. **Other documents**: Insurance cards, health cards, or other important documents.\n\nA wallet serves several purposes:\n\n1. **Organization**: It helps keep your personal items organized and easily accessible.\n2. **Security**: A wallet provides a secure place to store your valuables, protecting them from loss or theft.\n3. **Convenience**: It allows you to carry your essential items with you, making it easier to access them when needed.\n\nWallets come in various styles, materials, and designs, including:\n\n1. **Leather wallets**: Traditional, high-quality wallets made from leather.\n2. **Folding wallets**: Simple, compact wallets that fold up for easy storage.\n3. **Money clips**: Small, metal clips used to hold cash and cards together.\n4. **Card holders**: Slim, minimalist wallets designed to hold only a few cards.\n5. **Digital wallets**: Virtual wallets that store digital versions of your credit cards, IDs, and other documents.\n\nOverall, a wallet is a practical and essential item for everyday use, helping you stay organized, secure, and convenient.", "shortest_response": "A wallet is a small, portable container used to carry various financial and identification cards, as well as cash.

Hari Seldon, a mathematician and psychologist, has developed psychohistory, a new field of science and psychology that treats all possibilities in large societies by mathematics, allowing for the probabilistic prediction of future events.\n\nBy means of psychohistory, Seldon has discovered the decline and eventual fall of the Empire, angering the aristocratic members of the Commission of Public Safety, the de facto rulers of the Empire.

Seldon is tried by the Commission; he defends his beliefs, explaining his theories and predictions, including his belief that the Empire will collapse in 300 years and while a Second Empire will eventually rise it will only come after a 30,000-year dark age. He informs the Commission that an alternative to this future is attainable and explains to them that creating a compendium of all human knowledge, the Encyclopedia Galactica, may not prevent the inevitable fall of the Empire but would reduce the dark age to one millennium.\n\nThe skeptical Commission, not wanting to make Seldon a martyr, offers him exile to a remote world, Terminus, with others who could help him create the Encyclopedia.

Seldon informs Dornick that, despite the Empire's belief it won by exiling Seldon, the outcome was exactly what he had intended and hoped for.

A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by John of Aviz (later King John I of Portugal) and commanded by General Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira defeated the Castilians in the Battle of Aljubarrota. With this battle, the House of Aviz became the ruling house of Portugal.\n\nThe new ruling dynasty would proceed to push Portugal to the limelight of European politics and culture, creating and sponsoring works of literature, like the Cr\u00f3nicas d'el Rei D. Jo\u00e3o I by Fern\u00e3o Lopes, the first riding and hunting manual Livro da ensinan\u00e7a de bem cavalgar toda sela and O Leal Conselheiro both by King Edward of Portugal and the Portuguese translations of Cicero's De Oficiis and Seneca's De Beneficiis by the well traveled Prince Peter of Coimbra, as well as his magnum opus Tratado da Vertuosa Benfeytoria. In an effort of solidification and centralization of royal power the monarchs of this dynasty also ordered the compilation, organization and publication of the first three compilations of laws in Portugal: the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es d'el Rei D. Duarte, which was never enforced; the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Afonsinas, whose application and enforcement was not uniform across the realm; and the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Manuelinas, which took advantage of the printing press to reach every corner of the kingdom. The Avis Dynasty also sponsored works of architecture like the Mosteiro da Batalha (literally, the Monastery of the Battle) and led to the creation of the manueline style of architecture in the 16th century.\n\nPortugal also spearheaded European exploration of the world and the Age of Discovery. Prince Henry the Navigator, son of King John I of Portugal, became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour. During this period, Portugal explored the Atlantic Ocean, discovering the Atlantic archipelagos the Azores, Madeira, and Cape Verde; explored the African coast; colonized selected areas of Africa; discovered an eastern route to India via the Cape of Good Hope; discovered Brazil, explored the Indian Ocean, established trading routes throughout most of southern Asia; and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to China and Japan.\n\nIn 1415, Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering Ceuta, the first prosperous Islamic trade centre in North Africa. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: Madeira and the Azores, which led to the first colonization movements.\n\nIn 1422, by decree of King John I, Portugal officially abandoned the previous dating system, the Era of Caesar, and adopted the Anno Domini system, therefore becoming the last catholic realm to do so.\n\n\nThroughout the 15th century, Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for several common types of tradable commodities at the time, ranging from gold to slaves, as they looked for a route to India and its spices, which were coveted in Europe.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas, intended to resolve the dispute that had been created following the return of Christopher Columbus, was made by Pope Alexander VI, the mediator between Portugal and Spain. It was signed on 7 June 1494, and divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two countries along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa).\n\n\nIn 1498, Vasco da Gama accomplished what Columbus set out to do and became the first European to reach India by sea, bringing economic prosperity to Portugal and its population of 1.7 million residents, and helping to start the Portuguese Renaissance. In 1500, the Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real reached what is now Canada and founded the town of Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, Newfoundland and Labrador, long before the French and English in the 17th century, and being just one of many Portuguese colonizations of the Americas.\n\nIn 1500, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral discovered Brazil and claimed it for Portugal. Ten years later, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Goa in India, Muscat and Ormuz in the Persian Strait, and Malacca, now a state in Malaysia. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic. Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe, landing in such places as Taiwan, Japan, the island of Timor, and in the Moluccas.\n\nAlthough for a long period it was believed the Dutch were the first Europeans to arrive in Australia, there is also some evidence that the Portuguese may have discovered Australia in 1521. From 1519 to 1522, Ferdinand Magellan (Fern\u00e3o de Magalh\u00e3es) organized a Spanish expedition to the East Indies which resulted in the first circumnavigation of the globe. Magellan never made it back to Europe as he was killed by natives in the Philippines in 1521.\n\nThe Treaty of Zaragoza, signed on 22 April 1529 between Portugal and Spain, specified the anti-meridian to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas.\n\nAll these factors made Portugal one of the world's major economic, military, and political powers from the 15th century until the late 16th century.", "longest_response": "The Treaty of Tordesillas was a treaty signed on June 7, 1494, by Pope Alexander VI, which divided the newly discovered lands outside of Europe between Portugal and Spain.

The key components of Hadoop are:\n\n1. **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)**: HDFS is the primary storage system in Hadoop. It allows for storing and processing large amounts of data across a cluster of nodes. HDFS is designed to handle the storage and retrieval of massive datasets, making it an ideal choice for big data processing.\n\n2. **MapReduce**: MapReduce is a programming model and software framework for processing large data sets in parallel across a cluster of computers. It consists of two main components:\n   - **Mapper**: The mapper takes input data, breaks it down into smaller chunks, and applies a mapping function to each chunk. The output of the mapper is then stored in an intermediate output file.\n   - **Reducer**: The reducer takes the output from the mapper and applies a reduction function to each chunk of data. The output of the reducer is the final output of the MapReduce job.\n\n3. **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)**: YARN is a resource management layer that sits on top of HDFS. It is responsible for managing the resources (memory, CPU, etc.) required by MapReduce jobs. YARN allows multiple applications to run on the same Hadoop cluster, making it a more flexible and scalable framework.\n\n4. **Hadoop Common**: Hadoop Common is a collection of libraries and utilities that provide a common set of functionality for Hadoop applications. It includes tools such as the Hadoop command-line interface, the Hadoop configuration system, and the Hadoop logging system.\n\n5. **Hadoop Streaming**: Hadoop Streaming is a utility that allows users to write MapReduce jobs in languages other than Java, such as Python, Perl, or Ruby. It uses the stdin/stdout mechanism to pass data between the mapper and reducer.\n\n6. **Hadoop Tools**: Hadoop Tools are a set of command-line utilities that provide a simple way to interact with Hadoop. They include tools such as the Hadoop fs (file system) command, the Hadoop job (job management) command, and the Hadoop dfsadmin (DFS administration) command.\n\n7. **HBase**: HBase is a NoSQL database that is built on top of HDFS. It is designed to handle large amounts of structured and semi-structured data. HBase provides a flexible schema and supports high-performance data processing.\n\n8. **Pig**: Pig is a high-level data processing language that is built on top of Hadoop. It provides a simple way to write data processing jobs using a SQL-like syntax. Pig is designed to handle large amounts of data and provides a flexible and scalable framework for data processing.\n\n9. **Hive**: Hive is a data warehousing and SQL-like query language for Hadoop. It provides a simple way to write data processing jobs using a SQL-like syntax. Hive is designed to handle large amounts of data and provides a flexible and scalable framework for data processing.\n\n10. **Flume**: Flume is a data ingestion tool that is designed to handle large amounts of data from various sources. It provides a flexible and scalable framework for data ingestion and is commonly used to collect data from log files, social media, and other sources.\n\n11. **Squid**: Squid is a caching proxy that is designed to improve the performance of Hadoop applications. It provides a caching layer that can reduce the load on HDFS and improve the performance of MapReduce jobs.\n\n12. **ZooKeeper**: ZooKeeper is a coordination service that is designed to manage the configuration and state of Hadoop applications.

It is mentioned in a Sydney Morning Herald restaurant column published in 1978. It is not mentioned in encyclopedias and dictionaries of the 1970s, first appearing in an Italian dictionary in 1980, and in English in 1982. It is mentioned in a 1983 cookbook devoted to cooking of the Veneto.\n\nObituaries for the restaurateur Ado Campeol (1928\u20132021) reported that it was invented at his restaurant Le Beccherie in Treviso on 24 December 1969 by his wife Alba di Pillo (1929\u20132021) and the pastry chef Roberto Linguanotto. The dish was added to its menu in 1972. Accounts by Carminantonio Iannaccone claim the tiramisu sold at Le Beccherie was made by him in his bakery, created on 24 December 1969.\n\nIt has been claimed that tiramisu has aphrodisiac effects and was concocted by a 19th-century Treviso brothel madam, as the Accademia Del Tiramis\u00f9 explains, to \"solve the problems they may have had with their conjugal duties on their return to their wives\".\n\nThere is evidence of a \"Tiremes\u00f9\" semi-frozen dessert served by the Vetturino restaurant in Pieris, in the Friuli Venezia Giulia, since 1938. This may be the name's origin, while the recipe for Tiramisu may have originated as a variation of another layered dessert, Zuppa Inglese.

There are several reasons why cycling is so popular in the Netherlands:\n\n1. **Flat terrain**: The Netherlands is a relatively flat country, making it easy to ride a bike. The landscape is dominated by low-lying plains, canals, and polders (reclaimed land), which reduces the need for hills and steep inclines.\n2. **Infrastructure**: The Dutch have invested heavily in building a comprehensive network of bike paths, bike lanes, and bike-friendly roads. These dedicated cycling infrastructure make it safe and convenient for people to ride their bikes.\n3. **Cycling-friendly culture**: Cycling is deeply ingrained in Dutch culture. From a young age, children are encouraged to ride bikes, and it's seen as a normal mode of transportation. This cultural acceptance of cycling contributes to its popularity.\n4. **Practicality**: Cycling is a practical way to get around in the Netherlands, especially in urban areas like Amsterdam, Utrecht, and Rotterdam. It's a quick and efficient way to navigate through congested city streets.\n5. **Environmental concerns**: The Dutch have a strong focus on sustainability and environmental protection. Cycling is a low-carbon mode of transportation, which aligns with the country's goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n6. **Historical influence**: The Netherlands has a long history of cycling. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, cycling became a popular mode of transportation, especially among the working class.

Studies have shown that dog owners are more likely to meet their daily physical activity goals than non-dog owners.\n2. **Reduced blood pressure**: Studies have found that dog owners tend to have lower blood pressure levels than non-dog owners, which can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n3. **Improved cardiovascular health**: Dog ownership has been linked to lower levels of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and overall cardiovascular disease risk.\n4. **Increased social connections**: Dogs can help their owners meet new people and form social connections, which is essential for physical and mental health.\n5. **Reduced stress and anxiety**: Interacting with dogs has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety levels in people, which can have a positive impact on physical health.\n6. **Improved mental health**: Dog ownership has been linked to improved mental health outcomes, including reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n7. **Increased vitamin D levels**: Some studies suggest that dog owners may have higher levels of vitamin D, which is essential for bone health and immune function.\n8. **Reduced risk of obesity**: Studies have found that dog owners are less likely to be obese than non-dog owners, which can reduce the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.\n9. **Improved immune system function**: Interacting with dogs has been shown to boost the immune system and reduce inflammation in people.\n10. **Increased sense of purpose**: Caring for a dog can give people a sense of purpose and responsibility, which can have a positive impact on physical and mental health.\n\nIt's essential to note that these benefits can vary depending on individual circumstances, such as the type of dog, the owner's lifestyle, and the level of interaction.

This can lead to improved cardiovascular health, weight management, and reduced risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.\n2. **Social Support**: Dogs are social animals that thrive on interaction with their human family members. This can lead to increased social support, which is linked to better mental and physical health outcomes. Studies have shown that dog owners are more likely to have a strong social network and engage in community activities.\n3. **Stress Reduction**: Interacting with dogs has been shown to reduce stress levels, lower blood pressure, and decrease symptoms of anxiety and depression. This is thought to be due to the release of oxytocin, a hormone associated with feelings of relaxation and bonding.\n4. **Improved Sleep**: Dog owners are more likely to have regular sleep patterns and improved sleep quality, which is essential for physical health and overall well-being.\n5. **Increased Vitamin D**: Studies have found that dog owners are more likely to have higher levels of vitamin D, which is essential for bone health and immune function.\n6. **Lower Blood Pressure**: Regular dog ownership has been linked to lower blood pressure and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.\n7. **Improved Immune Function**: Interacting with dogs has been shown to boost the immune system and reduce inflammation, which can help protect against illnesses like the common cold and flu.\n\nIt's essential to note that these benefits can vary depending on individual circumstances, such as the owner's lifestyle, the type of dog, and the amount of time spent with the dog.

Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995, Vapnik et al., 1997[citation needed]) SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods, being based on statistical learning frameworks or VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974). Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n\nIn addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\nThe support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data.[citation needed] These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data to groups and, then, to map new data according to these clusters.", "longest_response": "A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model used for classification and regression analysis.

The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.\n\nRadiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in 1993. Their debut single, \"Creep\", became a worldwide hit. Radiohead's popularity and critical standing rose with the release of The Bends in 1995. Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music.\n\nRadiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though Kid A divided listeners, it was later named the best album of the decade by multiple outlets. It was followed by Amnesiac (2001), recorded in the same sessions. Hail to the Thief (2003), with lyrics addressing the War on Terror, blended the band's rock and electronic sides, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI.\n\nRadiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway, and O'Brien have released solo albums; in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.\n\nBy 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart: \"Creep\" (1992), \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" (1996), \"Paranoid Android\" (1997), \"Karma Police\" (1997), \"No Surprises\" (1998), \"Pyramid Song\" (2001), and \"There There\" (2003). \"Creep\" and \"Nude\" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Rolling Stone named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and Rolling Stone readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s.

Boehm in the 1980s. It's a widely used model in the field of software engineering to estimate the effort and cost required to develop a software project.\n\nThe COCOMO model is based on a set of parameters that are derived from historical data from various software projects. The model uses a regression formula to estimate the effort and cost required for a new project based on these parameters.\n\nThere are three versions of the COCOMO model:\n\n1. **COCOMO 81**: This is the original version of the model, developed in 1981. It's based on data from 63 historical projects.\n2. **COCOMO II**: This is an updated version of the model, developed in 2000. It's based on data from 163 historical projects.\n3. **COCOMO III**: This is the latest version of the model, developed in 2000. It's based on data from 163 historical projects and is an extension of COCOMO II.\n\nThe COCOMO model estimates the effort required for a software project based on several parameters, including:\n\n* **Application size**: The size of the software application, measured in thousands of lines of code (KLOC).\n* **Development time**: The time required to develop the software, measured in months.\n* **Person-months**: The number of person-months required to develop the software.\n* **Effort**: The total effort required to develop the software, measured in person-hours.\n\nThe COCOMO model also takes into account various factors that affect software development, such as:\n\n* **Precedence**: The complexity of the software, measured on a scale of 0 to 5.\n* **Resourcing**: The availability of resources, such as people, equipment, and materials.\n* **Risk**: The level of risk associated with the project, measured on a scale of 0 to 5.\n\nBy using the COCOMO model, software project managers and developers can estimate the effort and cost required to develop a software project, which can help them plan and manage the project more effectively.\n\nHere's a simple example of how the COCOMO model works:\n\nSuppose we want to estimate the effort required to develop a software project with an application size of 10 KLOC, a development time of 6 months, and a precedence of 3 (moderate complexity). Using the COCOMO model, we can estimate the effort required as follows:\n\n* Effort = (10 KLOC) x (6 months) x (3) = 180 person-months\n* Person-hours = 180 person-months x 160 hours/month = 28,800 hours\n* Total cost = 28,800 hours x $100/hour = $2,880,000\n\nThis is a very simplified example, but it illustrates how the COCOMO model can be used to estimate the effort and cost required to develop a software project.", "shortest_response": "COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) is a software cost estimation model developed by Barry W.

It is an example of cannibalization.\nThe term alludes to the Osborne Computer Corporation, whose second product did not become available until more than a year after it was announced. The company's subsequent bankruptcy was widely blamed on reduced sales after the announcement.\nThe Osborne Effect states that prematurely discussing future, unavailable products damages sales of existing products. The name comes from the planned replacement of the Osborne 1, an early personal computer first sold by the Osborne Computer Corporation in 1981. In 1983, founder Adam Osborne pre-announced several next-generation computer models (the Osborne Executive and Osborne Vixen), which were only prototypes, highlighting the fact that they would outperform the existing model as the prototypes dramatically cut down assembly time. A widely held belief was that sales of the Osborne 1 fell sharply as customers anticipated those more advanced systems, leading to a sales decline from which Osborne Computer was unable to recover. This belief appeared in the media almost immediately after the company's September 1983 bankruptcy:\n\nTo give the jazzy $2,495 Osborne Executive a running start, Adam began orchestrating publicity early in 1983. We, along with many other magazines, were shown the machine in locked hotel rooms. We were required not to have anything in print about it until the planned release date in mid-April. As far as we know, nothing did appear in print, but dealers heard about the plans and cancelled orders for the Osborne 1 in droves. In early April, Osborne told dealers he would be showing them the machine on a one-week tour the week of 17 April, and emphasized that the new machine was not a competitor for the Osborne 1. But dealers didn't react the way Osborne expected; said Osborne, \"All of them just cancelled their orders for the Osborne 1.\"\n\nOsborne reacted by drastically cutting prices on the Osborne 1 in an effort to stimulate cash flow. But nothing seemed to work, and for several months sales were practically non-existent.\n\nPre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, with the revenue drop for the current product being offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available. However, when the Osborne effect occurs, the quantity of unsold goods increases and the company must react by discounting and/or lowering production of the current product, both of which depress cash flow.", "longest_response": "The price of the Osborne 1 is mentioned in the passage as $2,495 is the price of the Osborne Executive, and there is no direct mention of the price of the Osborne 1.

However, it reflects light in the green part of the spectrum, which is why it appears green to our eyes.\n\nThere are several reasons why chlorophyll is green:\n\n1. **Energy absorption**: Chlorophyll absorbs light energy in the blue and red parts of the spectrum, but reflects light in the green part. This is because the energy from blue and red light is more easily absorbed and used for photosynthesis, while the energy from green light is not as useful.\n2. **Evolutionary advantage**: The green color of chlorophyll may have evolved as an advantage for plants. Green is a wavelength that is not easily absorbed by water or other substances, so it is less likely to be scattered or absorbed by the environment, allowing more light to reach the plant's photosynthetic cells.\n3. **Structural requirements**: Chlorophyll has a specific molecular structure that requires a particular arrangement of atoms to absorb and reflect light. This structure is consistent with the green color we see.\n\nIn addition to chlorophyll, other pigments such as carotenoids and anthocyanins can also be present in plant leaves, contributing to their color. However, chlorophyll is the dominant pigment responsible for the green color of most plants.\n\nIt's worth noting that not all plants are green.

Compute the average of x and the number you're trying to find the square root of (let's call it n).\n3. Replace x with this new average.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the value of x converges to the square root of n.\n\nHere's the mathematical explanation behind why this method works:\n\nLet's say we're trying to find the square root of n. We'll call this square root \"s\". We start with an initial guess, x.\n\nWe want to find a better approximation of s by using the average of x and n/x. This is based on the following mathematical relationship:\n\ns \u2248 (x + n/x) / 2\n\nThis relationship can be derived from the following steps:\n\n1. s^2 = n\n2. s^2 = (x + n/x)^2 (by squaring both sides)\n3. s^2 \u2248 x^2 + 2x(n/x) + (n/x)^2 (using the binomial theorem)\n4. s^2 \u2248 x^2 + 2n + (n/x)^2\n5. Since s^2 = n, we can substitute n for s^2:\n   n \u2248 x^2 + 2n + (n/x)^2\n6. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n   n - x^2 - 2n \u2248 (n/x)^2\n   -(n - x^2) \u2248 (n/x)^2\n7. Taking the square root of both sides (and ignoring the negative sign), we get:\n   sqrt(-(n - x^2)) \u2248 n/x\n8. Using the fact that s^2 = n, we can rewrite the left-hand side as:\n   sqrt(-(n - s^2)) \u2248 n/x\n9. Since s^2 = n, we can substitute n for s^2:\n    sqrt(-(n - n)) \u2248 n/x\n10. Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:\n    sqrt(0) \u2248 n/x\n11. Since sqrt(0) = 0, we can rewrite the equation as:\n    0 \u2248 n/x\n12. Finally, we can multiply both sides by x to get:\n    0x \u2248 n\n    0x \u2248 n/x\n13. This equation is equivalent to:\n    x \u2248 (x + n/x) / 2\n\nSo, the divide and average method is based on the mathematical relationship s \u2248 (x + n/x) / 2. This method iteratively refines the estimate of the square root, s, by using the average of the current estimate, x, and n/x.\n\nThe reason why this method converges to the square root of n is that the average of x and n/x is always closer to the square root of n than x itself. This is because the average of two numbers is always closer to their midpoint than either of the numbers themselves.

In other words, (x + y)^2 = n, where y is the difference between the actual square root and our guess.\n\nExpanding the equation (x + y)^2 = n using the binomial theorem, we get:\nx^2 + 2xy + y^2 = n\n\nSince we're looking for the square root, we want to find the value of y. Rearranging the equation, we get:\ny = (n - x^2) / (2x)\n\nNow, we can update our guess 'x' by averaging it with the actual square root.

We'll also use the fact that y is very small compared to x, so we can neglect the y^2 term.\n\nSo, we update our guess 'x' as follows:\nx_new = (x + n/x) / 2\n\nThis is the divide and average method for computing square roots. It works by repeatedly dividing the guess by 2 and averaging it with the original guess, which is equivalent to updating the guess using the formula above.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the method works:\n\n1. Start with an initial guess 'x'.\n2. Calculate x_new = (x + n/x) / 2.\n3. Replace 'x' with 'x_new'.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until 'x_new' converges to the actual square root.\n\nThis method works because it uses the fact that the square root of 'n' is a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives us 'n'. By repeatedly updating our guess using the formula above, we're effectively narrowing down the range of possible values for the square root until we converge to the actual value.", "input_size": 48, "output_sizes": [654, 584, 629, 664, 483, 609, 484, 577, 472, 679], "output_mean": 583.5, "output_std": 74.68, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 507.25, "p50": 596.5, "p75": 647.75, "p99": 677.65}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 16.15836}, {"sample_id": "1e3428286e9f49f3", "prompt_id": "3c03855fd21f1cec", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What are 6 different reasons to go on vacation?", "longest_response": "Here are six different reasons to go on vacation:\n\n1. **Relaxation and Stress Relief**: A vacation can provide a much-needed break from the stresses of daily life, allowing you to recharge and refocus.

As the largest optical telescope in space, it is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars, the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.\n\nThe U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led JWST's design and development and partnered with two main agencies: the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Maryland managed telescope development, while the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore on the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University currently operates JWST. The primary contractor for the project was Northrop Grumman. The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana, and arrived at the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point in January 2022. The first JWST image was released to the public via a press conference on 11 July 2022.\n\nJWST's primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated beryllium, which combined create a 6.5-meter-diameter (21 ft) mirror, compared with Hubble's 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). This gives JWST a light-collecting area of about 25 square meters, about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet and visible (0.1 to 0.8 \u03bcm), and near infrared (0.8\u20132.5 \u03bcm) spectra, JWST observes a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light (red) through mid-infrared (0.6\u201328.3 \u03bcm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below 50 K (\u2212223 \u00b0C; \u2212370 \u00b0F), such that the infrared light emitted by the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. It is deployed in a solar orbit near the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point, about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 mi) from Earth, where its five-layer sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\n\nInitial designs for the telescope, then named the Next Generation Space Telescope, began in 1996. Two concept studies were commissioned in 1999, for a potential launch in 2007 and a US$1 billion budget. The program was plagued with enormous cost overruns and delays; a major redesign in 2005 led to the current approach, with construction completed in 2016 at a total cost of US$10 billion. The high-stakes nature of the launch and the telescope's complexity were remarked upon by the media, scientists, and engineers.", "longest_response": "Here's a summary of the James Webb Space Telescope:\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is a cutting-edge space telescope designed for infrared astronomy, capable of observing objects that are too old, distant, or faint for other telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope.

Revenue and expense should be kept separate from personal expenses.\nGoing Concern: assumes that the business will be in operation indefinitely. This validates the methods of asset capitalization, depreciation, and amortization. Only when liquidation is certain this assumption is not applicable. The business will continue to exist in the unforeseeable future.\nMonetary Unit principle: assumes a stable currency is going to be the unit of record. The FASB accepts the nominal value of the US Dollar as the monetary unit of record unadjusted for inflation.\nTime-period principle: implies that the economic activities of an enterprise can be divided into artificial time periods.\nPrinciples\nHistorical cost principle: requires companies to account and report assets and liabilities acquisition costs rather than fair market value. This principle provides information that is reliable (removing opportunity to provide subjective and potentially biased market values), but not very relevant. Thus there is a trend to use fair values. Most debts and securities are now reported at market values.\nRevenue recognition principle: holds that companies should record revenue when earned but not when received. The flow of cash does not have any bearing on the recognition of revenue. This is the essence of accrual basis accounting. Conversely, however, losses must be recognized when their occurrence becomes probable, whether or not it has actually occurred. This comports with the constraint of conservatism, yet brings it into conflict with the constraint of consistency, in that reflecting revenues/gains is inconsistent with the way in which losses are reflected.\nMatching principle: expenses have to be matched with revenues as long as it is reasonable to do so. Expenses are recognized not when the work is performed, or when a product is produced, but when the work or the product actually makes its contribution to revenue. Only if no connection with revenue can be established, cost may be charged as expenses to the current period (e.g., office salaries and other administrative expenses). This principle allows greater evaluation of actual profitability and performance (shows how much was spent to earn revenue). Depreciation and Cost of Goods Sold are good examples of application of this principle.\nFull disclosure principle: Amount and kinds of information disclosed should be decided based on trade-off analysis as a larger amount of information costs more to prepare and use. Information disclosed should be enough to make a judgment while keeping costs reasonable. Information is presented in the main body of financial statements, in the notes or as supplementary information\nConstraints\nObjectivity principle: The company financial statements provided by the accountants should be based on objective evidence.\nMateriality principle: The significance of an item should be considered when it is reported. An item is considered significant when it would affect the decision of a reasonable individual.\nConsistency principle: The company uses the same accounting principles and methods from period to period.\nConservatism principle: When choosing between two solutions, the one which has the less favorable outcome is the solution which should be chosen (see convention of conservatism)\nCost Constraint: The benefits of reporting financial information should justify and be greater than the costs imposed on supplying it.", "longest_response": "The four basic principles of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) are:\n\n1. **Historical Cost Principle**: Requires companies to account and report assets and liabilities at their acquisition costs, rather than their fair market value.

This principle is based on the accrual basis of accounting and ensures that revenue is recognized when it is earned, regardless of when cash is received.\n\n3. **Matching Principle**: Expenses should be matched with revenues as long as it is reasonable to do so. This principle ensures that expenses are recognized in the same period as the revenue they help to generate, allowing for a more accurate evaluation of profitability and performance.\n\n4. **Full Disclosure Principle**: Requires companies to disclose sufficient information about their financial activities, while also considering the costs of providing that information. The amount and type of information disclosed should be based on a trade-off analysis between the benefits of disclosure and the costs of providing that information.\n\nThese principles provide a framework for accounting and financial reporting, and are used in conjunction with the assumptions and constraints of GAAP to ensure that financial statements are accurate, reliable, and useful to stakeholders.", "shortest_response": "The four basic principles of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) are:\n\n1. **Historical Cost Principle**: Requires companies to account and report assets and liabilities at their acquisition costs, rather than their fair market value.

Raw chicken: 2 hours maximum. Due to bacterial growth, it's likely to be spoiled after 6 days at room temperature. It's best to err on the side of caution and discard it.\n\n2. Jar of olives: Olives are typically pickled in a brine solution, which has a high acidity level (pH 4.6 or lower). This acidity helps to preserve the olives and prevent bacterial growth. As a result, a jar of olives can be safely stored at room temperature for an extended period. However, always check the jar for any signs of spoilage, such as mold, sliminess, or an off smell. If the olives look and smell fine, they should be safe to eat.\n\n3. Hard cheese: Hard cheeses, such as cheddar or parmesan, have a lower moisture content, which makes them more resistant to bacterial growth. However, it's still essential to check the cheese for any signs of spoilage. If the cheese has developed an off smell, mold, or an unusual texture, it's best to discard it.\n\n4. Milk: Milk is a dairy product that can support bacterial growth, especially at room temperature. Generally, milk can be safely stored at room temperature for 6-8 hours, but not for 6 days. It's best to discard the milk to avoid any potential health risks.\n\n5. Fruit jelly: Fruit jelly is a high-acid food, similar to the olives. The acidity helps to preserve the jelly and prevent bacterial growth. As a result, a fruit jelly can be safely stored at room temperature for an extended period. However, always check the jelly for any signs of spoilage, such as mold, sliminess, or an off smell. If the jelly looks and smells fine, it should be safe to eat.\n\nIn summary, the safest options from your list would be the jar of olives and the hard cheese (if they show no signs of spoilage).

These animals are:\n\n1. **Lion** (Panthera leo): Known for their powerful roars and sharp claws.\n2. **Elephant** (Loxodonta africana): The largest land animal, with a massive body and a long tusk.\n3. **Buffalo** (Syncerus caffer): A large and aggressive bovine with a thick hide and sharp horns.\n4. **Leopard** (Panthera pardus): A sleek and agile predator with a distinctive coat pattern and sharp claws.\n5. **Rhino** (Diceros bicornis): A large and powerful herbivore with a distinctive horn and a tough hide.\n\nThese animals were considered the \"Big Five\" because they were the most challenging to hunt due to their size, strength, and aggressive behavior. However, in recent years, the term has taken on a new meaning, and many tour operators and wildlife enthusiasts now use it to refer to a safari experience where visitors can see these animals in their natural habitat.\n\nIn this context, the \"Big Five\" refers to the thrill of spotting these incredible creatures in the wild, and the experience is often considered a highlight of any African safari.", "input_size": 44, "output_sizes": [312, 348, 311, 311, 326, 373, 274, 313, 331, 347], "output_mean": 324.6, "output_std": 25.8, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 311.25, "p50": 319.5, "p75": 343.0, "p99": 370.75}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "brainstorming", "gen_time": 8.1516}, {"sample_id": "c7a40abf41f230fd", "prompt_id": "ff142759d58fe55d", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Was Furze Hill an established community in the 19th century?\nContext: Furze Hill (or Furzehill) is a hamlet situated in the New Forest National Park of Hampshire, England.

The main differences between them are:\n\n1. **Purpose:** \n   - **Putter:** A putter is used for rolling the ball on the green, typically within a short distance (usually under 50 feet) from the hole. Its primary function is to help the ball roll smoothly and accurately towards the hole.\n   - **Driver:** A driver is used for hitting the ball off the tee, usually on the first shot of a hole or when trying to reach a long distance. Its primary function is to propel the ball as far as possible down the fairway.\n\n2. **Clubhead design:**\n   - **Putter:** Putters have a flat, broad clubhead with a face that is usually weighted to help the ball roll smoothly. The clubhead is designed to strike the ball with a glancing blow, allowing it to roll rather than fly.\n   - **Driver:** Drivers have a large, flat clubhead with a face that is designed to hit the ball with a high-speed, low-angle blow. This design allows the ball to fly far and straight.\n\n3. **Loft and angle:**\n   - **Putter:** Putters have a very low loft (usually around 3-5\u00b0), which means the clubhead is almost parallel to the ground. This allows the ball to roll smoothly on the green.\n   - **Driver:** Drivers have a high loft (usually around 8-14\u00b0), which helps the ball fly higher and farther.\n\n4. **Swing style:**\n   - **Putter:** The putter is typically swung with a smooth, gentle motion, using a pendulum-like motion to strike the ball.\n   - **Driver:** The driver requires a more powerful swing, using the legs, core, and arms to generate speed and distance.\n\nIn summary, a putter is used for short, accurate shots on the green, while a driver is used for long-distance shots off the tee.

Her genre-spanning discography, songwriting abilities and artistic reinventions have received critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country artist to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.\nSwift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\nExiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021\u2014Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her 2022 album Midnights and single \"Anti-Hero\" broke all-time streaming records. Swift has directed music videos and films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and played supporting roles in others.\nHaving sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians in history. She is the most streamed woman on Spotify and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards; and 92 Guinness World Records. Swift has been featured in rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment.

Isn't it possible that the listener would associate \"pencil\" with \"wood\"? Maybe the listener would associate the word \"pencil\" with \"round\" instead (as pencils are, usually, in fact, round!). Wittgenstein writes regarding several possible \"interpretations\" which may arise after such a lesson. The student may interpret your pointing at a pencil and saying \"pencil\" to mean the following: (1) This is a pencil; (2) This is round; (3) This is wood; (4) This is one; (5) This is hard, etc., etc.", "longest_response": "Ludwig Wittgenstein views the problem with learning a language using \"ostensive defining\" as the potential for multiple, ambiguous interpretations of the definition. This is often referred to as the \"private language argument.\" \n\nWhen a teacher uses ostensive defining, such as pointing to a pencil and saying \"pencil,\" the learner may not necessarily understand the intended meaning. Instead, the learner may associate the word \"pencil\" with various characteristics of the object being pointed to, such as its shape (round), material (wood), size (one), or texture (hard).\n\nWittgenstein argues that this ambiguity arises because words and definitions are not fixed or determinate, but rather are subject to various interpretations. He contends that meaning is not a matter of private mental states or associations, but rather is a product of shared social and cultural practices.\n\nIn the example you provided, Wittgenstein would likely argue that the learner's interpretation of \"pencil\" as \"round\" or \"wood\" is not necessarily a mistake or a misinterpretation, but rather a legitimate and possible meaning of the word. This highlights the problem of how we can establish a shared understanding of language, and how we can ensure that our words and definitions have a common meaning.\n\nWittgenstein's solution to this problem is to emphasize the importance of language games and shared practices in establishing meaning. He argues that meaning is not something that can be defined or determined in isolation, but rather emerges from the social and cultural context in which language is used. By participating in language games and shared practices, speakers can develop a shared understanding of words and definitions, and avoid the ambiguities and misunderstandings that arise from ostensive defining.", "shortest_response": "According to Wittgenstein, the problem with learning a language using \"ostensive defining\" is that it is ambiguous and open to multiple interpretations. When teaching someone a word by pointing to an object and saying the word, there is no guarantee that the learner will understand the intended meaning. The learner may associate the word with various characteristics of the object, such as its shape (round), material (wood), size (one), or hardness, rather than the intended meaning of the word (pencil).\n\nWittgenstein's point is that the ostensive definition is not a reliable method for establishing a shared understanding of a word's meaning. The learner's interpretation of the word may be based on their own experiences, perceptions, and associations, which may not align with the teacher's intended meaning. This ambiguity highlights the challenges of language acquisition and the importance of social and cultural context in shaping our understanding of words and their meanings.", "input_size": 272, "output_sizes": [342, 280, 230, 277, 325, 293, 317, 344, 186, 304], "output_mean": 289.8, "output_std": 47.4, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 277.75, "p50": 298.5, "p75": 323.0, "p99": 343.82}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "information_extraction", "gen_time": 8.52071}, {"sample_id": "0884468f02b377f5", "prompt_id": "2678b784a17d61a6", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Write a letter to your friend expressing your feelings about earning your first wage.", "longest_response": "Dear [Friend's Name],\n\nI hope this letter finds you well.
