The base case is set where `dp[0][0] = 1`, as there is one permutation (the empty permutation) when both `n` and `k` are zero.\n3. We fill the `dp` table using the recurrence relation for Entringer numbers:\n   - For `dp[i][0]`, it equals `dp[i-1][i-1]` because the first element must be the smallest and the remaining elements form a permutation counted by `e(i-1, i-1)`.\n   - For `dp[i][j]` where `j > 0`, it is the sum of `dp[i-1][i-1-j]` and `dp[i][j-1]`. This accounts for permutations starting with a value less than or equal to `j` and those starting with a value greater than `j`.\n4.
