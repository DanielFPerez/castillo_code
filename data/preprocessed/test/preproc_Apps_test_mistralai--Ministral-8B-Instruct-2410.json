The input includes the weights of the packages and the number of days (D) within which all packages must be shipped.\n\nWe can use binary search to determine the minimum capacity. The idea is to check if a given capacity allows the packages to be shipped within D days. If the capacity is too small, increase the capacity. If it's too large, decrease it. This ensures we find the smallest capacity that meets the requirements.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define the search space**: The left bound of the search space is the largest weight since even if you could ship only the heaviest packet each day, the ship would need to be able to carry at least the heaviest packet. The right bound could initially be the sum of all weights since technically any ship could carry all the packages in a single day.\n\n2. **Binary search**: Iterate by halving the search space and checking if a given capacity allows the packages to be shipped within D days.\n\n3. **Check Feasibility**: For a given capacity, check if the packages can be shipped within D days. This involves iterating through the packages and accumulating the total weight until it exceeds the capacity or all packages are loaded, and then incrementing the number of days accordingly.\n\nHere is the complete solution in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:\n        # Calculate the total weight of all packages\n        total_weight = sum(weights)\n\n        # Binary search for the minimum capacity\n        left, right = max(weights), total_weight\n\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            current_weight = 0\n            days_needed = 1\n\n            for weight in weights:\n                if current_weight + weight > mid:\n                    current_weight = 0\n                    days_needed += 1\n                current_weight += weight\n\n                if days_needed > D:\n                    right = mid  # Mid is not feasible, try a smaller capacity\n                    break\n\n            if days_needed > D:\n                left = mid + 1  # Increase the capacity\n            else:\n                right = mid  # Mid is feasible, may need a smaller capacity\n\n        return left  # left will be the minimal capacity at the end\n\n# Example usage:\nsolution = Solution()\nprint(solution.shipWithinDays([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 5))  # Output: 15\nprint(solution.shipWithinDays([3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4], 3))  # Output: 6\nprint(solution.shipWithinDays([1, 2, 3, 1, 1], 4))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: We start with the maximum of the single package weights as the minimum capacity (left bound) and the total weight of all packages as the maximum capacity (right bound).\n- **Binary Search Loop**: While the left bound is less than the right bound:\n  - Calculate the midpoint of the current search space.\n  - Reset the accumulated weight and the count of days at the start of each iteration.\n  - For each package, check if adding the package exceeds the current capacity. If it does, reset the accumulated weight and increase the day count. Otherwise, add the package weight to the accumulated weight.\n  - Check if the number of days needed exceeds D. If so, adjust the right bound to mid (since the current mid capacity is insufficient). If not, adjust the right bound to mid (since further checks are unnecessary as mid might be the minimum feasible capacity).\n- **Final Capacity**: After exiting the loop, the left bound will be the minimum capacity required to ship all packages within D days.\n\nThis approach ensures we efficiently find the minimal shipping capacity.", "shortest_response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum cargo capacity of a ship that can transport all packages within the specified number of days. The cargo must be shipped in the order given, and no splitting of packages is allowed.\n\nWe can solve this problem using a binary search approach. The low bound for the capacity will be the maximum weight of the packages alone, and the high bound will be the sum of all the package weights. By applying binary search, we can efficiently narrow down the required capacity.\n\nHere is the Python code for the solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:\n        def is_possible(capacity: int) -> bool:\n            current_weight = 0\n            days_remaining = D\n\n            for weight in weights:\n                current_weight += weight\n                days_remaining -= 1\n                if current_weight > capacity:\n                    return False\n\n            return True\n\n        low, high = max(weights), sum(weights)\n\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if is_possible(mid):\n                high = mid\n            else:\n                low = mid + 1\n\n        return low\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Helper Function `is_possible(capacity)`**:\n   - This function checks if a given capacity can transport all packages within D days.\n   - `current_weight` keeps track of the total weight loaded on the ship per day.\n   - `days_remaining` tracks the number of days left to reach `D`.\n   - For each `weight` in `weights`, we add it to `current_weight`.\n   - If `current_weight` exceeds the `capacity`, return `False` as the capacity is insufficient.\n   - If all weights are loaded within D days, return `True`.\n\n2. **Binary Search**:\n   - Initialize `low` as the maximum weight of any single package.\n   - Initialize `high` as the sum of all weights.\n   - While `low` is less than `high`, calculate `mid`.\n   - If `is_possible(mid)` is `True`, update `high` to `mid` (narrow down the capacity).\n   - If `is_possible(mid)` is `False`, update `low` to `mid + 1` (increase the capacity).\n\n3. **Return**:\n   - When the loop ends, `low` will be the least weight capacity of the ship required to transport all packages within D days.\n\nThis approach ensures we find the minimum required cargo capacity efficiently using binary search.", "input_size": 555, "output_sizes": [683, 862, 560, 734, 546, 715, 802, 803, 795, 638], "output_mean": 713.8, "output_std": 101.59, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 649.25, "p50": 724.5, "p75": 800.25, "p99": 856.69}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 29.22441}, {"sample_id": "f22287d690cd5352", "prompt_id": "52840a4d06a14326", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "Apps", "prompt_text": "QUESTION: Given an\u00a0integer n, add a dot (\".\")\u00a0as the thousands separator and return it in\u00a0string format.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 987\nOutput: \"987\"\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 1234\nOutput: \"1.234\"\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 123456789\nOutput: \"123.456.789\"\n\nExample 4:\nInput: n = 0\nOutput: \"0\"\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= n < 2^31\n\nYour code should start with the following: \n\nclass Solution:\n    def thousandSeparator(self, n: int) -> str:\n        \nThe following is the standard input and output format: \nInputs:\n[987]\nOutputs:\n987", "longest_response": "To solve the problem of adding a dot (\".\") as the thousands separator to an integer `n`, you can follow these steps:\n\n1.

This way, we can efficiently get the index of the pile with the most stones.\n   - Iterate while there are still piles with one or more stones remaining.\n3. **Count Occurrences**: After constructing the sequence, count the occurrences of each index in the sequence and output the results.\n\nHere's the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef count_lexicographic_sequence():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    N = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+N]))\n    rest = [(i, 1) for i in range(1, N+1)]\n\n    # Creating a max heap to keep track of remaining stones\n    heapq.heapify(rest)\n\n    seq = []\n\n    # Construct the sequence\n    while rest:\n        # Pop the smallest index pile, then push it back with decremented stone count\n        idx, stones = heapq.heappop(rest)\n        seq.append(idx)\n        heapq.heappush(rest, (idx, stones - 1))\n\n        # If stones reach 0, don't add to heap\n        while rest and rest[0][1] == 0:\n            heapq.heappop(rest)\n\n    # Count occurrences\n    count = [0] * (N + 1)\n    for number in seq:\n        count[number] += 1\n\n    # Output result\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        print(count[i])\n\n# Example:\n# Input:\n# N (number of piles) followed by a_1 a_2 ... a_N\n# e.g.:\n# 2\n# 1 2\n# or\n# 10\n# 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 8 1\n\n# Output the result for each integer (i) occurrence count in the lexicographical smallest sequence.\n\ncount_lexicographic_sequence()\n```\n\n> Note: For competitive programming platforms, you should use the `sys.stdin.read` method to read entire input at once if you expect large inputs and to avoid performance issues with frequent reads.\n\n## Explanation:\n- **Input Handling**: Reads and parses the input data efficiently.\n- **Heap Usage**: Efficiently picks the pile with the smallest index among the heaviest piles.\n- **Sequence Construction**: Constructs the sequence by always choosing the smallest index from the heaviest remaining piles.\n- **Counting Occurrences**: After constructing the sequence, counts occurrences of each integer index and prints the results.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle both the constraints and the logic required to produce the lexicographically smallest sequence efficiently.", "shortest_response": "To solve this problem, follow these steps for constructing the lexicographically smallest sequence and then determining the occurrences of each index i:\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of piles \\( N \\) and the stone counts for each pile \\( a_i \\).\n\n2. **Simulate the Construction Process**:\n    - Maintain a list to track the number of remaining stones in each pile.\n    - Continuously select the pile with the smallest index from the piles with the largest remaining stones, and remove one stone from that pile.\n    - Track the order in which these piles are removed.\n\n3. **Track Removals**: Keep track of which index is removed and in what order.

However, when the array contains duplicates, this straightforward binary search might fail because the elements are not unique and won't guarantee a strict division of the search space into distinct parts.\n\n### Handling Duplicates\nBecause duplicates can appear, the array can't always be split into two halves where each half is sorted. This can potentially cause extra complexity in binary search.\n\n### Solution\nWe can use a modified binary search algorithm that handles the duplicates by ensuring that we ignore the duplicates in the decision-making process of the binary search. Specifically, while checking if \\( \\text{nums}[low] \\) and \\( \\text{nums}[mid] \\) are equal (to avoid infinite loops), we skip one of the duplicates to proceed correctly with the binary search.\n\nHere is the code implementing the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> bool:\n        if not nums:\n            return False\n\n        low, high = 0, len(nums) - 1\n\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n            if nums[mid] == target:\n                return True\n\n            # skip duplicates\n            while low < mid and nums[low] == nums[mid]:\n                low += 1\n            while high > mid and nums[mid] == nums[high]:\n                high -= 1\n\n            # Determine which part to continue searching\n            if nums[low] <= nums[mid]:\n                # Left half is sorted\n                if nums[low] <= target < nums[mid]:\n                    high = mid - 1\n                else:\n                    low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                # Right half is sorted\n                if nums[mid] < target <= nums[high]:\n                    low = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    high = mid - 1\n\n        return False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Start with pointers `low` at the beginning and `high` at the end of the array.\n- **Main Loop**: Continue until `low` exceeds `high`.\n  - Calculate the middle index `mid`.\n  - If the target is found at `mid`, return `True`.\n  - **Skip Duplicates**: Move `low` and `high` to skip over any consecutive duplicates.\n  - **Determine the Sorted Part**: Check whether the left part (from `low` to `mid`) or the right part (from `mid` to `high`) is sorted.\n  - **Adjust Search Range**: Depending on which part is sorted and whether the target falls into that range, adjust the `low` or `high` pointers to continue the search in the correct part of the array.\n\n### Follow-up\nThe presence of duplicates does affect the complexity slightly because:\n- The binary search's efficiency might degrade to \\(O(n)\\) in the worst case where duplicates cause a linear traversal.\n- The while loop for skipping duplicates can degrade the binary search to \\(O(n \\log n)\\) since in the worst case with maximum duplicate elements, the search range gets linearly reduced.\n\nThis solution ensures the search remains efficient by skipping duplicates and leveraging the sorted nature of the rotated array segments effectively.", "shortest_response": "This problem can be solved using a modified binary search algorithm. The key idea is to narrow down the search space by checking if the left half of the array is sorted or not. If it is sorted, then you can easily determine if the target is in the left half of the array. Otherwise, the right half of the array must contain the target.\n\nHere's the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> bool:\n        left, right = 0, nums.length - 1\n\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if nums[mid] == target:\n                return True\n\n            if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:  # left half is sorted\n                if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:  # target is in the left half\n                    right = mid - 1\n                else:\n                    left = mid + 1\n            else:  # right half is sorted\n                if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:  # target is in the right half\n                    left = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    right = mid - 1\n\n        return False\n```\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the length of the array. This is because at each step, we are reducing the search space by half, leading to a logarithmic time complexity.\n\nHowever, the presence of duplicates in the array may slightly affect the time complexity. In the worst case, if there are multiple duplicates, we might end up iterating through all the elements in the array, leading to a linear time complexity. This happens when the target is one of the duplicated values and they are not in a sorted order, forcing us to check each element individually. However, this is an edge case and in practice, the binary search approach will still be efficient for most scenarios.", "input_size": 259, "output_sizes": [721, 691, 719, 687, 639, 707, 668, 662, 650, 405], "output_mean": 654.9, "output_std": 87.45, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 653.0, "p50": 677.5, "p75": 703.0, "p99": 720.82}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 20.53285}, {"sample_id": "0b429d7886de467f", "prompt_id": "ad034a45116e9691", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "Apps", "prompt_text": "QUESTION: # Task\n Pero has been into robotics recently, so he decided to make a robot that checks whether a deck of poker cards is complete.\n\n He\u2019s already done a fair share of work - he wrote a programme that recognizes the suits of the cards.

From each center, expand outwards while the substring remains a palindrome.\n2. **Store Results:**\n   - Maintain a list to store all found palindromic substrings.\n3. **Determine the Smallest:**\n   - After exploring all potential palindromic substrings, sort and select the smallest substring by length. If there are multiple substrings of the same length, choose the lexicographically smallest one.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Initialize and Define Functions:**\n   - Function to expand around centers for odd-length palindromes (single character).\n   - Function to expand around centers for even-length palindromes (pair of characters).\n   - Main loop to process each test case.\n\n2. **Input Parsing:**\n   - Read the input and determine how many test cases there are.\n\n3. **Process Each Test Case:**\n   - For each test case, initialize necessary data structures and check each character and each pair of adjacent characters for potential palindromic substrings.\n\n4. **Calculate Substrings:**\n   - Use two helper functions to calculate the length of palindromic substrings expanding around each character/pair center.\n\n5. **Select Optimal Substring:**\n   - After finding all potential palindromic substrings, choose the smallest one based on length and lexicographical order.\n\nLet's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef expand_around_center(s, left, right):\n    while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n        left -= 1\n        right += 1\n    return s[left + 1:right]\n\ndef find_smallest_palindrome(N, s):\n    smallest_palindrome = None\n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(i, N):\n            substring = expand_around_center(s, i, j)\n            if smallest_palindrome is None or (len(substring) < len(smallest_palindrome) or\n                                              (len(substring) == len(smallest_palindrome) and substring < smallest_palindrome)):\n                smallest_palindrome = substring\n    return smallest_palindrome\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nindex = 0\nT = int(data[index])\nindex += 1\n\nresults = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    s = data[index]\n    index += 1\n    result = find_smallest_palindrome(N, s)\n    results.append(result)\n\nindex += 1\nsys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Expand Around Center Function (`expand_around_center`):** This function takes a string and two indices and returns the shortest palindromic substring centered at those indices. It extends outwards while the characters match.\n- **Find Smallest Palindrome Function (`find_smallest_palindrome`):** This function generates all possible substrings by looping through all pairs of start and end indices, then uses `expand_around_center` to find the shortest palindromic substring centered around each pair. It keeps track of the smallest one encountered.\n- **Main Input Reading:** Standard input is read, processed, and results are accumulated.\n- **Output Handling:** Finally, results are printed in the required format.\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the smallest palindromic substring using a direct, brute-force method, which is feasible due to the constraints.", "shortest_response": "To solve the problem of finding the smallest palindromic substring of a given length \\( N \\) from a string, we need to break down the problem into a few key steps:\n\n1. **Check for Palindromes**: We need to check every possible substring of the given length \\( N \\) to see if it forms a palindrome. A palindrome is defined as a string that reads the same forward and backward.\n\n2. **Find the Smallest Palindromic Substring**: Among all the palindromic substrings of the given length \\( N \\), we need to find the smallest lexicographically. This means if there are multiple palindromic substrings of the same length, we need to select the one that appears first in the lexicographical order.\n\nLet's write the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_smallest_palindrome(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    smallest_palindrome = s[0] if s[0] else \"\"\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            substring = s[i:j + 1]\n            if len(substring) == n and substring == substring[::-1]:\n                if not smallest_palindrome:\n                    smallest_palindrome = substring\n                elif substring < smallest_palindrome:\n                    smallest_palindrome = substring\n\n    return smallest_palindrome\n\n# Reading inputs\nT = int(input().strip())\nresults = []\n\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input().strip())\n    s = input().strip()\n    result = find_smallest_palindrome(s)\n    results.append(result)\n\n# Printing the results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: `find_smallest_palindrome(s)` is defined to process a single string `s` and find the smallest palindromic substring of length \\( N \\).\n\n2. **Loop Through Substrings**: Nested loops are used to generate all possible substrings of length \\( N \\). These loops iterate through every possible starting index (`i`) and ending index (`j`), inclusive, of substrings.\n\n3. **Check for Palindromes**: For each substring, it checks if the substring is equal to its reverse. If it is, we check if it's the smallest palindromic substring encountered so far.\n\n4. **Comparison**: If multiple palindromic substrings are found, they are compared lexicographically.\n\n### Running the Code:\nWhen the code is run and the given inputs are processed, it will output the smallest palindromic substrings for each test case.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible substrings and find the smallest one among them.

Handle cases where characters have the same frequency by including the original order of their first appearance in the string.\n\nHere's the complete code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:\n        # Count the frequency of each character\n        frequency = Counter(s)\n\n        # Sort the characters by frequency (in decreasing order) and then by their first occurrence\n        sorted_chars = sorted(frequency.keys(), key=lambda x: (-frequency[x], s.index(x)))\n\n        # Create the result string by rebuilding it with sorted characters\n        result = \"\"\n        for char in sorted_chars:\n            result += char * frequency[char]\n\n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\nsolution = Solution()\nprint(solution.frequencySort(\"tree\"))    # Output: \"eetr\" or \"eert\"\nprint(solution.frequencySort(\"cccaaa\"))  # Output: \"cccaaa\"\nprint(solution.frequencySort(\"Aabb\"))    # Output: \"bbAa\" or \"bbaA\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Counting Frequencies**: We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to get the frequency of each character in the string.\n\n2. **Sorting Characters**: We sort the characters in two ways:\n   - By their frequency in decreasing order (`-frequency[x]` ensures it sorts by frequency in descending order).\n   - By their first occurrence in the string (`s.index(x)`). If two characters have the same frequency, their order of appearance in the string determines the order.\n\n3. **Building the Result String**: We rebuild the string by concatenating each character repeated by its frequency.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n\n**Example 1: \"tree\"**\n\n- Frequencies: `{'t': 1, 'r': 1, 'e': 2}`\n- Sorted characters based on frequency and original order: `['e', 'r', 't']`\n- Result string: \"eetr\"\n\n**Example 2: \"cccaaa\"**\n\n- Frequencies: `{'c': 3, 'a': 3}`\n- Sorted characters based on frequency and original order: `['c', 'a']`\n- Result string: \"cccaaa\"\n\n**Example 3: \"Aabb\"**\n\n- Frequencies: `{'A': 1, 'b': 2, 'a': 1}`\n- Sorted characters based on frequency and original order: `['b', 'A', 'a']`\n- Result string: \"bbAa\"\n\nThis solution ensures that the characters are sorted by decreasing frequency and maintains the relative order of characters with the same frequency based on their first occurrence in the string.", "shortest_response": "```python\nclass Solution:\n    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:\n        counter = {}\n        for char in s:\n            if char in counter:\n                counter[char] += 1\n            else:\n                counter[char] = 1\n        sorted_chars = sorted(counter.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        result = ''\n        for char, freq in sorted_chars:\n            result += char*freq\n        return result\n\nsolution = Solution()\nprint(solution.frequencySort('tree'))\nprint(solution.frequencySort('cccaaa'))\nprint(solution.frequencySort('Aabb'))\n```\nIn this task, our function should take care of each character's frequency by counting their occurrence.

This will give us the minimum possible sum.\n\n4. **Output the Result**.\n\n### Detailed Explanation\n- **Sorting**: Sorting helps in easily accessing the maximum and minimum elements in the array.\n- **Reduction**: Each larger element is reduced until it matches the minimum value, ensuring the sum is minimized because we are making elements as equal as possible.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\n#### Example Case 1:\n- Input: `1`, `1`\n- Array: `[1]`\n- Resulting Array: Already at minimum sum, which is `1`.\n\n#### Example Case 2:\n- Input: `2`, `1 1 2 4 6`\n- Sorted Array: `[1, 1, 2, 4, 6]`\n- Choose the target value as the minimum value in sorted array which is `1`.\n- We have to reduce all values to `1`:\n  - `4 -= 1` becomes `3`\n  - `3 -= 1` becomes `2`\n  - Already `1`\n  - Already `1`\n- Sum = `1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 6`\n\n### Code Implementation:\n\nHere's a Python function to perform the above steps:\n\n```python\ndef min_array_sum(t, cases):\n    result = []\n    for case in cases:\n        n = case[0]\n        array = sorted(case[1])\n        if len(array) == 1:\n            result.append(array[0])\n        else:\n            result_sum = 0\n            target = array[-1]  # Target value for reduction\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                while array[i] > target:\n                    array[i] -= target\n                result_sum += array[i]\n\n            result.append(result_sum)\n\n    return result\n\n# Reading input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nindex = 0\nt = int(data[index])\nindex += 1\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    array = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))\n    index += n\n    test_cases.append((n, array))\n\n# Get results\nresults = min_array_sum(t, test_cases)\n\n# Output results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n- **Input Handling**: Reading all input at once and splitting by space.\n- **Processing Test Cases**: Iterate through each test case, sort the array, determine the reduction process to target value, and calculate the resulting sum.\n- **Efficient Output**: Print each result for all test cases.\n\nThis solution ensures efficient processing and handles the constraints effectively.", "shortest_response": "```python\nt = int(input())\nresult = []\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    min_sum = sum(A) + 1\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if A[i] > A[j]:\n                A[i] -= A[j]\n    result.append(sum(A))\nfor r in result:\n    print(r)\n```", "input_size": 466, "output_sizes": [664, 592, 695, 768, 99, 661, 644, 541, 675, 625], "output_mean": 596.4, "output_std": 175.4, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 600.25, "p50": 652.5, "p75": 672.25, "p99": 761.43}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 24.52226}, {"sample_id": "746fd0d7009d3169", "prompt_id": "e42a22af447ee044", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "Apps", "prompt_text": "QUESTION: You are to write a function to transpose a guitar tab up or down a number of semitones. The amount to transpose is a number, positive or negative. The tab is given as an array, with six elements for each guitar string (fittingly passed as strings). Output your tab in a similar form.\n\nGuitar tablature (or 'tab') is an alternative to sheet music, where notes are replaced by fret numbers and the five lines of the staff are replaced by six lines to represent each of the guitar's strings. It is still read from left to right like sheet music, and notes written directly above each other are played at the same time.\n\nFor example, Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven begins:\n```\ne|-------5-7-----7-|-8-----8-2-----2-|-0---------0-----|-----------------|\nB|-----5-----5-----|---5-------3-----|---1---1-----1---|-0-1-1-----------|\nG|---5---------5---|-----5-------2---|-----2---------2-|-0-2-2-----------|\nD|-7-------6-------|-5-------4-------|-3---------------|-----------------|\nA|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-2-0-0---0--/8-7-|\nE|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n```\nTransposed up two semitones, it would look like this:\n```\ne|-------7-9-----9-|-10-----10-4-----4-|-2---------2-----|------------------|\nB|-----7-----7-----|----7--------5-----|---3---3-----3---|-2-3-3------------|\nG|---7---------7---|------7--------4---|-----4---------4-|-2-4-4------------|\nD|-9-------8-------|-7---------6-------|-5---------------|------------------|\nA|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-4-2-2---2--/10-9-|\nE|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n```\nNote how when the 8th fret note on the top string in bar 2 gets transposed to the 10th fret, extra '-' are added on the other strings below so as to retain the single '-' that originally separated that beat (i.e. column) from the following note \u2013 fret 7 on the B string.\n\nEach beat must retain at least one '-' separator before the next, to keep the tab legible. The inputted test tabs all obey this convention.\n\nElectric guitars usually have 22 frets, with the 0th fret being an open string. If your fret numbers transpose to either negative values or values over 22, you should return 'Out of frets!' (and probably detune your guitar).\n\nTests include some randomly generated guitar tabs, which come with no guarantee of musical quality and/or playability...!\n\nYour code should start with the

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Identify the constraints**:\n   - We have \\(N\\) sorcerers, one of whom is an evil sorcerer.\n   - We have \\(M\\) spells, each represented by \\(p_i\\), where \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_M\\) are distinct powers.\n   - We can cyclically assign living sorcerers to integers starting from yourself.\n   - We can cast a spell to kill the sorcerer assigned to the spell's power.\n   - We cannot kill ourselves.\n\n2. **Optimal Strategy**:\n   - To maximize the number of sorcerers killed, we ideally want to minimize the number of spell repetitions such that unique sorcerers are targeted each time.\n   - If \\(N \\geq M + 1\\), we can potentially kill all but one sorcerer, leveraging the cyclic assignment to always pick a different sorcerer.\n   - If \\(N < M + 1\\), we can only kill \\(N-1\\) sorcerers regardless of the powers.\n\n3. **Cyclic Assignment and Killing**:\n   - The cyclic nature means that repeatedly choosing a position \\(p_j\\) will always target a different sorcerer if the total number of remaining sorcerers is more than the number of distinct spells.\n   - Using powers \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_M\\) ensures distinct selections until we run out of sorcerers or spells.\n\n4. **Algorithm Implementation**:\n   - For each test case, we first check if \\(N \\geq M+1\\). If true, calculate the number of sorcerers to be killed as \\(N-1\\). If false, \\(N-1\\) sorcerers can be killed by clever positioning of spells without repeating.\n\nHere\u2019s the Python code implementing this logic efficiently:\n\n```python\ndef max_kill_sorcerers():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        M = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + M]))\n        index += M\n\n        if N >= M + 1:\n            results.append(N - 1)\n        else:\n            results.append(N - 1)\n\n    print(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)))\n\n# Reading input\n# Assuming input is given as a string of newline-separated input data\ninput_data = [\n    '5',\n    '4 1',\n    '5',\n    '6 2',\n    '2 4',\n    '1 4',\n    '7 16 8 29',\n    '1000000000 1',\n    '998244353',\n    '1 1',\n    '20201220'\n]\n\n# Process each test case individually and gather results\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        input.read()\n    except IndexError:\n        break\n\nimport sys\nsys.stdin = input_data\nmax_kill_sorcerers()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Reading Input**: This method reads the input from a list of strings simulating the input format.\n- **Iterating Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it checks if \\(N \\geq M + 1\\) and accordingly appends the maximum number of sorcerers that can be killed to the result list.\n- **Efficient Printing**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle the constraints efficiently and correctly determine the maximum number of sorcerers that can be killed in each test case.

If each bit position across the entire sequence has an even number of occurrences of `1`, we can choose $X$ such that all elements turn to zero.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Bit Position Parity Analysis**:\n   - Compute the parity count for each bit position in the sequence.

This observation leads to a strategy that eliminates the need to check every possible triple.\n\n### Detailed Strategy:\n1. For each number in the array, compute the XOR of the entire sequence to its right. This step requires \\(O(N)\\) time. To clarify, call this set of values \\( \\text{right\\_xor} \\) where \\( \\text{right\\_xor}[i] \\) is the XOR of all numbers from \\([i,N-1]\\).\n\n2. Use a hash table (dictionary in Python) to count the frequency of each XOR value in the sequence \\([1, N-1]\\). This allows checking for any value that occurs multiple times (which is necessary for the conditions given in the problem).\n\n3. Traverse the right_XOR array to find the count of valid \\([i, k]\\) pairs, based on whether the XOR of the left segment \\([i, j]\\) matches the XOR of the right segment. If the same value appears multiple times in this count, then the condition on \\((i, j, k)\\) has been met.\n\n### Implementation in Python:\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this solution:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    import collections\n\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        # Initialize right XOR array\n        right_xor = [0] * N\n\n        # Calculate right XOR values\n        for i in range(N):\n            if i == N-1:\n                right_xor[i] = A[i]\n            else:\n                right_xor[i] = A[i] ^ right_xor[i + 1]\n\n        # Dictionary to store frequency of each XOR value up to N-1\n        xor_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n        for i in range(N):\n            xor_count[A[i]] += 1\n\n        result = 0\n        for k in range(1, N + 1):\n            for i in range(1, k + 1):\n                # Check conditions on the triple (i, j, k)\n                left_xor = xor_count[A[i] ^ A[i - 1]] if 1 <= i - 1 < N else -1\n                right_result = 0\n                if right_xor[k - 1] in xor_count:\n                    right_result = xor_count[right_xor[k - 1]]\n                result += left_xor * right_result\n\n        print(result)\n\n# Input handling and solution execution\nsolve()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The number of test cases \\(T\\) and sequence length \\(N\\) are read.

This contraction helps in maintaining the current constraints of the problem.\n\n3. **Update Results**:\n    - Calculate the length of the longest repeating substring based on the current window configuration and update the result if the current length is greater.\n\nBelow is the complete implementation of this approach:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        max_frequency = 0\n        replacement_limit = k\n        start = 0\n        max_length = 0\n\n        # Character frequency counter for the current window\n        character_count = Counter()\n        unique_chars = 0\n\n        for end in range(len(s)):\n            char = s[end]\n            character_count[char] += 1\n\n            if char not in max_frequency:\n                unique_chars += 1\n                max_frequency = max(max_frequency, character_count[char])\n\n            # Number of replacements required to make all characters in the window the same\n            replacements_needed = 0\n            max_count_char = character_count[char]\n            if k >= 0:\n                replacements_needed = unique_chars - max_frequency\n\n            while replacements_needed > k - unique_chars:\n                start_char = s[start]\n                character_count[start_char] -= 1\n\n                if character_count[start_char] == 0:\n                    del character_count[start_char]\n\n                unique_chars -= 1\n                start += 1\n\n            max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)\n\n        return max_length\n\n# Example usage:\ns1 = \"ABAB\"\nk1 = 2\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.characterReplacement(s1, k1))  # Output: 4\n\ns2 = \"AABABBA\"\nk2 = 1\nprint(sol.characterReplacement(s2, k2))  # Output: 4\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to efficiently count the occurrences of each character in the current window.\n- The `max_frequency` keeps track of the highest frequency of any character in the current window.\n- The `replacement_limit` is calculated based on the number of distinct characters and their frequencies in the window.\n- The while loop ensures that the window maintains the maximum allowable replacements.\n- The result `max_length` stores the length of the longest possible repeating substring for the given constraints.\n\nThis solution is efficient with a time complexity of \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the length of the string. It ensures that we can handle large inputs within the given constraints (\\( \\leq 10^4 \\)).", "shortest_response": "To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach with a dictionary to keep track of the count of each character in the current window.

For example, RLE encoding of `\"aaaabbbbbbbbbbbcccccc\"` would give something like `4a 11b 6c`.\n\n(Look [here](http://www.codewars.com/kata/run-length-encoding/) for learning more about the run-length-encoding.)\n\nOf course, RLE is interesting only if the string contains many identical consecutive characters. But what bout human readable text? Here comes the Burrows-Wheeler-Transformation.\n\nTransformation\n-------------\nThere even exists a transformation, which brings equal symbols closer together, it is called the **Burrows-Wheeler-Transformation**. The forward transformation works as follows: Let's say we have a sequence with length n, first write every shift of that string into a *n x n* matrix:\n```\nInput: \"bananabar\"\n\nb a n a n a b a r\nr b a n a n a b a\na r b a n a n a b\nb a r b a n a n a\na b a r b a n a n\nn a b a r b a n a\na n a b a r b a n\nn a n a b a r b a\na n a n a b a r b\n```\nThen we sort that matrix by its rows. The output of the transformation then is the **last column** and the **row index** in which the original string is in:\n```\n               .-.\na b a r b a n a n\na n a b a r b a n\na n a n a b a r b\na r b a n a n a b\nb a n a n a b a r <- 4\nb a r b a n a n a\nn a b a r b a n a\nn a n a b a r b a\nr b a n a n a b a\n               '-'\n\nOutput: (\"nnbbraaaa\", 4)\n```\n\n```if:java\nTo handle the two kinds of output data, we will use the preloaded class `BWT`, whose contract is the following:\n\n    public class BWT {\n        \n        public String s;\n        public int n;\n        \n        public BWT(String s, int n)\n        \n        @Override public String  toString()\n        @Override public boolean equals(Object o)\n        @Override public int     hashCode()\n    }\n\n```\n\nOf course we want to restore the original input, therefore you get the following hints:\n\n1. The output contains the last matrix column.\n2. The first column can be acquired by sorting the last column.\n3. **For every row of the table:** Symbols in the first column follow on symbols in the last column, in the same way they do in the input string.\n4. You don't need to reconstruct the whole table to get the input back.\n\nGoal\n----\n\nThe goal of this Kata is to write both, the `encode` and `decode` functions. Together they should work as the identity function on lists. (*Note:* For the empty input, the row number is ignored.)\n\nFurther studies\n--------------\nYou may have noticed that symbols are not always consecutive, but just in proximity, after the transformation.

Consider a simplified view of a tennis game from directly above. The game will appear to be played on a 2 dimensional rectangle, where each player has his own court, a half of the rectangle. Consider the players and the ball to be points moving on this 2D plane. The ball can be assumed to always move with fixed velocity (speed and direction) when it is hit by a player. The ball changes its velocity when hit by the other player. And so on, the game continues.\nChef also enjoys playing tennis, but in n+1$n + 1$ dimensions instead of just 3. From the perspective of the previously discussed overhead view, Chef's court is an n$n$-dimensional hyperrectangle which is axis-aligned with one corner at (0,0,0,\u2026,0)$(0, 0, 0, \\dots, 0)$ and the opposite corner at (l1,l2,l3,\u2026,ln$(l_1, l_2, l_3, \\dots, l_n$). The court of his opponent is the reflection of Chef's court across the n\u22121$n - 1$ dimensional surface with equation x1=0$x_1 = 0$.\nAt time t=0$t=0$, Chef notices that the ball is at position (0,b2,\u2026,bn)$(0, b_2, \\dots, b_n)$ after being hit by his opponent. The velocity components of the ball in each of the n$n$ dimensions are also immediately known to Chef, the component in the ith$i^{th}$ dimension being vi$v_i$. The ball will continue to move with fixed velocity until it leaves Chef's court. The ball is said to leave Chef's court when it reaches a position strictly outside the bounds of Chef's court. Chef is currently at position (c1,c2,\u2026,cn)$(c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n)$. To hit the ball back, Chef must intercept the ball before it leaves his court, which means at a certain time the ball's position and Chef's position must coincide.\nTo achieve this, Chef is free to change his speed and direction at any time starting from time t=0$t=0$. However, Chef is lazy so he does not want to put in more effort than necessary. Chef wants to minimize the maximum speed that he needs to acquire at any point in time until he hits the ball. Find this minimum value of speed smin$s_{min}$.\nNote: If an object moves with fixed velocity \u2192v$\\vec{v}$ and is at position \u2192x$\\vec{x}$ at time 0$0$, its position at time t$t$ is given by \u2192x+\u2192v\u22c5t$\\vec{x} + \\vec{v} \\cdot t$.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line contains t$t$, the number of test cases. t$t$ cases follow.\n- The first line of each test case contains n$n$, the number of dimensions.\n- The next line contains n$n$ integers l1,l2,\u2026,ln$l_1, l_2, \\dots, l_n$, the bounds of Chef's court.\n- The next line contains n$n$ integers b1,b2,\u2026,bn$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$, the position of the ball at t=0$t=0$.\n- The next line contains n$n$ integers v1,v2,\u2026,vn$v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$, the velocity components of the ball.\n- The next line contains n$n$ integers, c1,c2,\u2026,cn$c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n$, Chef's position at t=0$t=0$.\n\n-----Output-----\n- For each test case, output a single line containing the value of smin$s_{min}$.

For Chef it is optimal to move along the blue line at a constant speed of 2 until he meets the ball at the boundary.\nCase 2: The court is 3-dimensional and the ball is coming straight at Chef.

Below is a step-by-step solution to derive the required minimum speed.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Setup**:\n   - We are given the dimensions of a court, initial position and velocity of the ball, and Chef's initial position.\n   - Chef's goal is to minimize the maximum speed required to intercept the ball within his court.\n\n2. **Calculate the Time When Ball Exits the Court**:\n   - For each dimension, compute the time at which the ball will hit the boundaries of the court. This is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{time} = \\frac{l_i - b_i}{v_i}\n     \\]\n     where \\( l_i \\) is the length of the court in dimension \\( i \\), \\( b_i \\) is the initial position of the ball in dimension \\( i \\), and \\( v_i \\) is the velocity component of the ball in dimension \\( i \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Closest Approach Boundary in Chef\u2019s Court**:\n   - We need to find the boundary in Chef's court where the ball\u2019s trajectory approaches the closest.\n   - The minimum time it takes for the ball to reach any boundary is the minimum among these calculated times.\n\n4. **Calculate the Speed Required for Chef**:\n   - The distance Chef needs to cover to reach the point where the ball will be can be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{required distance} = \\text{(current position of Chef)} - \\text{(position of the ball at minimum time)}\n     \\]\n   - The speed needed by Chef is the distance divided by the time taken, with time being the minimum time calculated above.\n   - This is the maximum speed Chef needs to achieve at any point in time to intercept the ball before it exits the court.\n\n5. **Handle Edge Cases**:\n   - If the ball is already in the opposite dimension from Chef, the optimal speed might be zero.\n   - Ensure the solution handles boundary conditions and different dimensions gracefully.\n\n### Implementation\n\nWe will implement this logic in Python, ensuring we take all constraints into account and calculate the speed requirements accurately.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef min_speed REQUIRED_SM (n, l, b, v, c):\n    # Calculate time to hit each boundary\n    time_to_boundaries = [max((l[i] - b[i]) / v[i] for i in range(n))]\n\n    # Calculate the position of the ball at the minimum time\n    time = time_to_boundaries[0]\n    ball_position_at_min_time = [(b[i] + v[i] * time) for i in range(n)]\n\n    # Calculate chef's required speed\n    distance_to_ball = [(c[i] - ball_position_at_min_time[i]) for i in range(n)]\n    chef_speed = math.sqrt(sum(dist ** 2 for dist in distance_to_ball))\n\n    # Calculate the maximum speed chef needs\n    return chef_speed\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    index = 0\n    t = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        l = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        b = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        v = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n        c = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n        index += n\n\n        min_speed_result = min_speed(n, l, b, v, c)\n        results.append(f\"{min_speed_result:.4f}\")\n\n    sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(results) + '\\n')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis program reads the input as specified, computes the minimum speed Chef needs to intercept the ball, and outputs the results.

Each queue will store tuples of the form (position, senator_role), where `position` is the index of the senator and `senator_role` is either 'R' or 'D'.\n2. **Simulate rounds** by picking senators from the front of the queues and having the winning senator ban the next senator from the front of either of the queues.\n3. **Check for victory conditions**:\n   - The winning senator announces victory when all remaining participants are from the same party.\n\nHere is the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def predictPartyVictory(self, senate: str) -> str:\n        # Queues for Radiant and Dire senators\n        radiant = deque()\n        dire = deque()\n\n        # Add all senators to the corresponding queues\n        for i, s in enumerate(senate):\n            if s == 'R':\n                radiant.append(i)\n            else:\n                dire.append(i)\n\n        # Simulate the voting rounds\n        while radiant and dire:\n            # Get the first senator from each queue\n            r_index = radiant.popleft()\n            d_index = dire.popleft()\n\n            # The senator who came first has the right to ban\n            if r_index < d_index:\n                radiant.append(r_index + len(senate))\n            else:\n                dire.append(d_index + len(senate))\n\n        return \"Radiant\" if radiant else \"Dire\"\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Initialization**: We use two `deque` objects to store the indices of `R` and `D` senators.\n2. **Loading Queues**: We iterate through the input string and add the indices and roles to respective queues.\n3. **Voting Simulation**:\n   - While both queues are not empty, we pick the senator from each front of the queues.\n   - The senator from the front of the queue that has the lower index has the right to ban the senator from the other queue.\n   - The banned senator is added back to the end of the respective queue with an index incremented by the length of the string, simulating that the next round will come after all senators.\n4. **Victory Condition**: If one of the queues is empty, the other party wins. \"Radiant\" wins if they are left, otherwise \"Dire\" wins.\n\nThis solution efficiently simulates the round-based voting process by leveraging queue operations, making it manageable even for the maximum input size of 10,000.", "input_size": 564, "output_sizes": [630, 777, 633, 681, 636, 686, 604, 733, 765, 667], "output_mean": 681.2, "output_std": 56.62, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 633.75, "p50": 674.0, "p75": 721.25, "p99": 775.92}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 26.00212}, {"sample_id": "1673617b863a3cb7", "prompt_id": "2c6463f3cf94b68e", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "Apps", "prompt_text": "QUESTION: Find the sum of the odd numbers within an array, after cubing the initial integers.

The text key can be of any perfect square length but for the sake of this kata we will focus on keys of length 4 forming a 2x2 matrix.\n\nTo encrypt a message using the hill cipher, first of all you need to convert the text key into a key matrix. To do that you will convert the key row wise into a 2x2 matrix. Then you will substitute the letters with their respective positions on the alphabet: A=0, B=1,C=2 and so on till Z=25. So for example if we get the key text as ```cats```, the key matrix will be:\n    \n    [[ 2  0]\n     [19 18]]\n     \nNow the next step is to break the text into pairs of two and convert those pairs into 2x1 matrices.

We use a loop that iterates over the array with a step of 2 (`for i in range(0, len(a)-1, 2)`), ensuring that we only look at pairs of adjacent elements.\n2. For each pair, we check if the current element is less than the next, and if the next element is less than the next of the next. If any of these conditions are true, it means the wave property is violated, and we perform a swap between the first pair elements to correct the order.\n\nHere is how you can test the function:\n\n```python\n# Test arrays\nprint(\"Before sorting:  \", [4, 1, 7, 5, 6, 2, 3])\nwave_sort([4, 1, 7, 5, 6, 2, 3])\nprint(\"After sorting:   \", [4, 1, 7, 5, 6, 2, 3])\n\nprint(\"Before sorting:  \", [1, 4, 5, 3])\nwave_sort([1, 4, 5, 3])\nprint(\"After sorting:   \", [1, 4, 5, 3])\n```\n\nNote that the test will likely demonstrate the local adjustment made by the sorting function rather than returning a sorted array in any global sense since the solution sorts the pairs locally in-place.\n\nSince the function performs in-place sorting, you'd need multiple iterations through the list to ensure all pairs fulfill the wave condition. However, the provided implementation focuses on the basic requirement of local pair adjustments.

We need to determine how many times a particular week repeat within each month.\n\n2. **Handling the first day of the year and week alignment**: The first day of the year is also the start of the week which helps in figuring out how the days of each month align with weeks.\n\n3. **Calculate the ambiguous pairs**: For each pair of months `(x, y)` where \\( x < y \\), we need to count the days that align in week positions.\n\n### Approach:\n\nLet \\( w \\) be the number of days in a Berland week, \\( m \\) be the number of months, and \\( d \\) be the number of days in each month.\n\n- The first day of each month can be represented relative to the first day of the year using modulo arithmetic. This will help in identifying cyclic repeats of days within a week.\n- We need to count pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that day \\( x \\) in month \\( y \\) and day \\( y \\) in month \\( x \\) fall on the same day of the week.\n\n### Key Concept:\n\n- **Day alignment within a week**:\n  If we treat the year as starting week \\( \\equiv 0 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ w) \\), this helps in determining the day alignment for the start of each month.\n  For each day in month \\( x \\) (where \\( x \\) ranges from 1 to \\( m-1 \\)), we need to find how they align with each other's weeks in different months.\n\n### Implementation:\n\nBelow is the Python solution based on the above logic:\n\n```python\ndef ambiguous_pairs(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        m, d, w = case\n        total_days = m * d\n        ambiguous_count = 0\n\n        # Calculate when we cross weeks in days for different months\n        week_cycle = [0] * w  # will store the remainders when days are divided by w (week length)\n        for i in range(1, m + 1):\n            for j in range(1, d + 1):\n                week_cycle[(j - 1) % w] = (week_cycle[(j - 1) % w] + i) % w\n\n        # Counting pairs where x < y and day x in month y is the same day of week as day y in month x\n        # for each day, find similar day in week of other months\n        for day in range(1, w + 1):\n            for month in range(1, m):\n                if (week_cycle[(day - 1) % w] == 0 and\n                    total_days % w == 0) or (week_cycle[(day - 1) % w] == week_cycle[0]):\n                    ambiguous_count += 2 * m - 1 + (total_days // w)  # +((d - (day - 1)) % w + 1)\n        results.append(ambiguous_count)\n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nt = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(t):\n    m, d, w = map(int, data[index:index + 3])\n    test_cases.append((m, d, w))\n    index += 3\n\n# Compute results\nresults = ambiguous_pairs(t, test_cases)\n\n# Print results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- We first read all input data and parse it.\n- For each test case, we compute the equivalent days modulo \\( w \\) to account for days in weeks.\n- We then count the pairs that qualify based on the logic explained above.\n- Finally, we output the results for each test case.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the number of ambiguous pairs given the constraints.", "shortest_response": "To solve the problem of counting ambiguous pairs \\((\\textit{x}, \\textit{y})\\) such that day \\(\\textit{x}\\) of month \\(\\textit{y}\\) is the same day of the week as day \\(\\textit{y}\\) of month \\(\\textit{x}\\), we need to analyze the weekly cycle and how days distribute across the year.\n\nHere's a detailed approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Week Cycle Concept**: Since the week repeats every \\(\\textit{w}\\) days, for each day \\(\\textit{d}\\) of a month, any day which is \\(\\textit{w}\\) times \\(\\textit{d}\\) modulo \\(\\textit{w}\\) would fall on the same day of the week.\n\n2. **Modulo Operation**: We need to calculate the difference days between any two months and the remainder of that difference when divided by \\(\\textit{w}\\). The ambiguous case happens when this remainder is zero.\n\n3. **Counting the Cases**:\n    - For each month, we should count how many days within a month fall on the same day of the week as another reference day in another month.\n    - Specifically, if \\(\\textit{d}\\) is within [0, \\(\\textit{w}-1\\)], then for each day \\(\\textit{d}\\) within the months, the other reference days will follow the modular equation based on \\(\\textit{w}\\).\n\nGiven the constraints, we cannot directly simulate each month and day to check the condition due to the large values of \\(\\textit{m}\\), \\(\\textit{d}\\), and \\(\\textit{w}\\).

For each pair of adjacent stones, if they are the same color, we count this pair and increment a removal counter.\n3. **Adjust for Balance:** For the minimal number of removals, we can consider the worst-case scenario by ensuring that each color is removed based on the balance of its counts to adjacent pairs of other colors.\n\nLet's implement the solution:\n\n```python\ndef solution(stones):\n    # Dictionary to hold the count of each color\n    color_count = {'R': 0, 'G': 0, 'B': 0}\n\n    # Create a copy of the stones string to work with\n    stones = list(stones)\n\n    # Count the number of each color in the string\n    for stone in stones:\n        color_count[stone] += 1\n\n    # Prepare our result\n    result = 0\n\n    # Find minimum color pairs to remove\n    for i in range(len(stones) - 1):\n        if stones[i] == stones[i + 1]:\n            # Both adjacent stones are the same color, adjust counts accordingly\n            color = stones[i]\n            color_count[color] -= 1\n            stones[i] = stones[i + 1] = ''\n\n    return color_count['R'] + color_count['G'] + color_count['B']\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Count the Colors:** We count each color in the input string.\n2. **Identify Misaligned Pairs:** We check each pair of adjacent stones and if they are the same color, we mark both for removal.\n3. **Adjust for Removed Stones:** After marking stones for removal, we sum the counts of each color after the potential removals to provide the minimum removals needed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we are considering the minimum number of stones needed to be removed to satisfy the condition.

Once a revisit is detected, we need to remove the invalid part and find a way to rearrange the remaining parts to keep the robot's path valid.\n\nHere is the Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef valid_sequence(s']:\n    n = len(s)\n    position = [0, 0]  # Initial robot position in (x, y)\n    visited = set()\n    i = 0\n\n    while i < n:\n        if (position[0], position[1]) == (0, 0):\n            visited.clear()\n        if (position[0], position[1]) in visited:\n            break\n        visited.add((position[0], position[1]))\n\n        if s[i] == 'L':\n            position[0] -= 1\n            i += 1\n        elif s[i] == 'R':\n            position[0] += 1\n            i += 1\n        elif s[i] == 'U':\n            position[1] += 1\n            i += 1\n        elif s[i] == 'D':\n            position[1] -= 1\n            i += 1\n\n    return s[:i]\n\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nq = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\nresults = []\n\nfor _ in range(q):\n    s = data[index]\n    index += 1\n    t = valid_sequence(s)\n    max_length = len(t)\n    results.append((max_length, t))\n\nfor result in results:\n    print(result[0])\n    print(result[1])\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Input Processing**: Read the sequence `s` for each test case and determine the maximum length of the valid path by removing invalid parts.\n\n- **Main Loop**: Iterate through the instructions, updating the robot's position and keeping track of the visited cells.\n\n- **Revised Sequence**: Once an invalid revisit is found, the loop terminates, and the valid part of the sequence up to that point is returned.\n\nThis solution ensures that the sequence is valid and minimalinvalid.

When a different character is encountered, increment the count.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Length**: After processing the entire string, the minimum length of the string will be the count of unique groups plus the length of the longest sequence of identical characters.\n\n### Algorithm\n\n1. Initialize a counter to keep track of groups.\n2. Initialize a character variable to store the current character.\n3. Initialize a group count variable to keep track of groups of characters.\n4. Traverse through the string.\n5. For each character, compare it with the current character, and if they are not the same, increment the group count.\n6.

The city that he lives in can be represented as a directed graph with n nodes and m edges. Each edge has a weight capacity. A delivery consists of a bear carrying weights with their bear hands on a simple path from node 1 to node n. The total weight that travels across a particular edge must not exceed the weight capacity of that edge.\n\nNiwel has exactly x bears.

This implies that if we take the bitwise XOR of a number with `0`, it remains the same. Thus, for finding the `sXORe` of `n`, we only need to compute the XOR of all odd numbers up to `n` since these contribute the most to the final result (they are not nullified by additional XOR operations).\n\nHere is a possible implementation approach:\n\n1. We will compute the `sXORe` for the range from `1` to `n`, since `0` does not contribute to the XOR calculation.\n2.

If the total count of '1's is not divisible by 3, it's impossible to split the string as required.\n\n2. **Use Sliding Window Technique**:\n   - Maintain a sliding window of size equal to the number of '1's per part (i.e., the result of dividing the total number of '1's by 3).\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:\n   - Use a dynamic programming (DP) table to keep track of the number of ways to split the string up to a given index.\n\nLet's go ahead and implement this in the `numWays` function:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def numWays(self, s: str) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n        n = len(s)\n        total_ones = s.count('1')\n\n        if total_ones % 3 != 0:\n            return 0\n\n        ones_per_part = total_ones // 3\n        dp = [0] * (ones_per_part + 1)\n        dp[0] = 1\n\n        for char in s:\n            if char == '1':\n                for i in range(ones_per_part, -1, -1):\n                    dp[i - 1] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i]\n                    dp[i - 1] %= MOD\n\n        return sum(dp)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Count Total '1's**:\n   - We use `total_ones = s.count('1')` to get the total number of '1's in the string.\n   - If the total number of '1's is not divisible by 3, we return 0 immediately.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:\n   - The DP table `dp` is used to count the number of ways to form groups of '1's such that each part has exactly `ones_per_part` '1's.\n   - Initialize `dp[0] = 1` because there's always one way to form a group with 0 '1's (an empty group).\n\n3. **Populate DP Table**:\n   - As we iterate through the string, for each '1' (since the '0's do not affect our count), we adjust the DP table to simulate adding one more '1' to all valid smaller groups.\n\n4. **Sum Up Results**:\n   - Finally, sum up all the elements in the DP table to get the total number of ways to split the string.\n\nThe given function efficiently handles the problem constraints and will provide the required result.", "input_size": 389, "output_sizes": [905, 664, 709, 953, 764, 828, 910, 768, 641, 748], "output_mean": 789.0, "output_std": 101.58, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 718.75, "p50": 766.0, "p75": 885.75, "p99": 949.13}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 30.55505}, {"sample_id": "ed2ca1aa203c0248", "prompt_id": "44cf5beeccbe779f", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "Apps", "prompt_text": "QUESTION: You are going to be given a word.

The steps to achieve this are:\n\n1. **Normalize the Case**: Convert the string to lowercase to compare letters uniformly.\n2. **Count Occurrences**: Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in the word.\n3. **Check Uniqueness**: Ensure that each character has the same count. Since the string can contain letters, digits, and symbols, counting all characters is necessary.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef validate_word(word):\n    # Convert the string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity\n    word = word.lower()\n\n    # Count the occurrences of each character\n    char_count = {}\n    for char in word:\n        if char in char_count:\n            char_count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_count[char] = 1\n\n    # Check if all characters have the same count\n    counts = list(char_count.values())\n    return len(set(counts)) == 1\n\n# Example usages:\nprint(validate_word(\"abcabc\"))        # True\nprint(validate_word(\"Abcabc\"))        # True\nprint(validate_word(\"AbcabcC\"))       # False\nprint(validate_word(\"AbcCBa\"))        # True\nprint(validate_word(\"pippi\"))         # False\nprint(validate_word(\"?!?!?!\"))        # True\nprint(validate_word(\"abc123\"))        # True\nprint(validate_word(\"abcabcd\"))       # False\nprint(validate_word(\"abc!abc!\"))      # True\nprint(validate_word(\"abc:abc\"))       # True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Converting to Lowercase**: The entire word is converted to lowercase using `word = word.lower()`. This simplifies the comparison since 'a' and 'A' should be treated as the same character.\n\n2. **Counting Characters**: We iterate through each character in the word and use a dictionary `char_count` to store the count of each character. If a character already exists in the dictionary, we increment its count; otherwise, we add it with a count of 1.\n\n3. **Checking Counts**: After counting the occurrences of each character, we extract the values (counts) from the `char_count` dictionary and check if all counts are the same. This can be done by converting the counts to a set and checking if its length is 1. If the length is 1, it means all counts are the same.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the function correctly identifies whether a word is composed of characters that each appear the same number of times.", "shortest_response": "To determine whether each character in a given word has the exact same number of occurrences, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Count the occurrences of each character in the word.\n2. Check if all the counts are equal.\n3. Return `true` if all counts are equal, otherwise return `false`.\n\nHere is the code to accomplish this:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef validate_word(word):\n    if not word:\n        return False\n\n    # Count the occurrences of each character\n    counter = Counter(word)\n\n    # Find the number of unique character counts\n    unique_counts = len(counter)\n\n    # Check if all counts are equal\n    if all(count == list(counter.values())[0] for count in counter.values()):\n        return True\n    return False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Importing Counter from `collections`**: We use `Counter` to count the occurrences of each character in the string.\n2. **Handling empty string**: If the word is empty, return `False` immediately.\n3. **Counting occurrences**: We use `Counter(word)` to get the counts of each character.\n4. **Finding unique counts**: The `values()` method of the `Counter` object returns a list of character counts. The `len` function on this list gives us the total number of unique counts.\n5. **Checking counts**: We check if all counts are equal by comparing each count from `counter.values()` to the first count in the list.\n\n### Examples:\n- For the string `\"abcabc\"`, all counts are 2 for `a`, `b`, and `c`, so it returns `True`.\n- For the string `\"abcabcd\"`, the counts differ (2, 2, 2, 1), so it returns `False`.\n- For the string `\"123abc!\"`, all counts are 1, so it returns `True`.\n\nThis solution efficiently checks the necessary conditions and handles various edge cases, ensuring it works correctly for the given constraints.", "input_size": 362, "output_sizes": [550, 464, 568, 515, 544, 415, 525, 520, 547, 555], "output_mean": 520.3, "output_std": 44.66, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 516.25, "p50": 534.5, "p75": 549.25, "p99": 566.83}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 16.45699}, {"sample_id": "cfe01edd09b202c2", "prompt_id": "d807b9dc67db93a3", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "Apps", "prompt_text": "QUESTION: Hi there! \nYou have to implement the \n\n`String get_column_title(int num) // syntax depends on programming language`\n\nfunction that takes an integer number (index of the Excel column) and returns the string represents the title of this column.\n\n#Intro\nIn the MS Excel lines are numbered by decimals, columns - by sets of letters.\n\nFor example, the first column has the title \"A\", second column - \"B\", 26th - \"Z\", 27th - \"AA\". \n\n\"BA\"(53) comes after \"AZ\"(52), \"AAA\" comes after \"ZZ\".\n\n\n\n\nExcel?

We then look up this extension in the dictionary to find the media type.\n   - If the extension is not found in the dictionary, \"unknown\" is returned.\n\n4. **Output:**\n   - The media types are collected in a list `media_types`, which is then printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently look up the media type for each file name and handle cases where the extension is not found by returning \"unknown\".", "shortest_response": "Here's a Python program that implements the described functionality:\n\n```python\ndef lookup_media_types():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().strip().split('\\n')\n\n    # Parse the input\n    N, Q = map(int, data[0].split())\n    associations = {ext: media_type for ext, media_type in (line.split() for line in data[1:N+1])}\n    files = data[N+1:]\n\n    # Lookup and print media types for each file\n    for file in files:\n        if '.' in file:\n            extension = file.split('.')[-1]\n            if extension in associations:\n                print(associations[extension])\n            else:\n                print(\"unknown\")\n        else:\n            print(\"unknown\")\n\n# Run the program\nlookup_media_types()\n```\n\nIn this program, the input is read from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` to handle all the data at once. Here\u2019s how the code works:\n\n1. **Parsing the Input**:\n   - The first line contains two integers `N` and `Q`, which represent the number of media type associations and the number of file names, respectively.\n   - The next `N` lines contain the media type associations in the format `extension media_type`.\n   - The remaining `Q` lines contain the file names.\n\n2. **Processing the File Names**:\n   - For each file name, the code checks if it contains a period (`'.'`). If it does, it extracts the file extension by splitting the file name by the period and taking the last part.\n   - The program then checks if the extension exists in the dictionary of associations. If it does, it prints the associated media type; otherwise, it prints \"unknown\".\n\n3. **Handling Files Without Extensions**:\n   - If a file name does not contain a period, it directly prints \"unknown\" since the media type cannot be determined.\n\nThis approach ensures that the program efficiently handles the given input constraints and correctly determines the media type for each file name.", "input_size": 595, "output_sizes": [672, 702, 761, 623, 784, 615, 516, 682, 425, 773], "output_mean": 655.3, "output_std": 109.49, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 617.0, "p50": 677.0, "p75": 746.25, "p99": 783.01}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 26.64088}, {"sample_id": "a159c74cd56b6d52", "prompt_id": "378b437230dc1b36", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "Apps", "prompt_text": "QUESTION: Two sisters, A and B, play the piano every day.

Since the problem states that the characters are arranged in a row from 'A' to 'Z' and starting with index 0, we can derive that each alphabetic character 'A' to 'Z' has a unique integer value from 0 to 26 inclusive.\n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Convert each character to the corresponding integer value based on A=27.**\n    - The character 'A' (uppercase) would correspond to 27.\n\n2. **Convert the entire string to the corresponding integer value based on the given sample.**\n    - The string 'AND' would correspond to 65.\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Character to Number Conversion:**\n    Given that A is assigned the decimal value 27, all the alphabets from A to Z would be:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{cccccccccc}\n    A & B & C & D & E & F & G & H & I &  \\\\\n    27 & 28 & 29 & 30 & 31 & 32 & 33 & 34 & 35 &  \\\\\n    J & K & L & M & N & O & P & Q & R &  \\\\\n    36 & 37 & 38 & 39 & 40 & 41 & 42 & 43 & 44 &  \\\\\n    S & T & U & V & W & X & Y & Z & &  \\\\\n    45 & 46 & 47 & 48 & 49 & 50 & 51 & 52 &  \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n\n    From this table, we can see that 'A' = 27, 'B' = 28, ..., 'Z' = 52.\n\n2. **Form the Encoded Integer Value:**\n    The encoded value would be the sum of the positions of each character in the given string. For example:\n    - For the string 'A', because 'A' is the 0-th position, its encoded value would be 27.\n    - For the string 'AND', the positions would be 'A' (27), 'N' (4), 'D' (51). So, the encoded value would be \\( 27 + 4 + 51 = 82 \\).\n\n### Algorithm\n\nGiven the constraints and the nature of the task, we can directly use the pre-defined information and create a simple algorithm to find the encoded value of each string.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\nUse Python to generate the output because of its ease of use and the standard library functions.\n\n```python\ndef char_to_value(char):\n    return ord(char) - ord('A') + 1 if 'A' <= char <= 'Z' else None\n\ndef encode_string(s):\n    return sum(ord(c) - ord('A') + 1 for c in s)\n\ndef main(inputs):\n    return [str(ord('A') - 2 + i) for i, group in enumerate(inputs, 1)]\n\n# Sample Inputs\ninputs = ['A', 'AND']\n\n# Main Function\noutputs = main(inputs)\nfor out in outputs:\n    print(out)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Code:\n\n1. **char_to_value function:** Converts a character to its corresponding value based on the position given by the ASCII value minus 'A'.\n\n2. **encode_string function:** For any string `s`, convert each character to its corresponding value and sum up all those values.\n\n3. **main function:** This function reads the given inputs, converts each string to its encoded integer value, and returns the result.\n\n### Sample Output:\n\nWhen the inputs `['A', 'AND']` are given, the outputs `['27', '65']` are printed, as expected.\n\n#### Note:\n\nPlease make sure to handle different inputs and ensure the constraints are met.

It calculates the daily evaporation amount as a fraction of the current content.\n2. It then checks each day whether the current content is greater than or equal to the threshold fraction.\n3.

If the cost of changing this window from s to t is less than or equal to maxCost, it tries to expand this window. If the cost exceeds maxCost, a while loop is used to shrink the left end of the window until the cost is less than or equal to maxCost.\n\nAt each iteration, the longest valid window found is updated. This process ensures that the maximum length of the substring that can be changed to t with a cost less than or equal to maxCost is returned. If no such substring exists, max_equal_length will be 0.\n\nFor example, given s = \"abcd\" t = \"bcdf\" and maxCost = 3, the algorithm will iterate through the string and find that the largest valid window is from index 1 to 3 forming the substring \"bc\", which can be changed to \"bcd\" for a cost of 3.", "input_size": 401, "output_sizes": [596, 558, 591, 378, 783, 693, 670, 688, 545, 730], "output_mean": 623.2, "output_std": 109.76, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 566.25, "p50": 633.0, "p75": 691.75, "p99": 778.23}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 24.3082}, {"sample_id": "35c4142fb8f6c03d", "prompt_id": "d2b9500539347ff3", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "Apps", "prompt_text": "QUESTION: Chef and his girlfriend are going to have a promenade.

She wants to schedule the event so that it will finish as early as possible. However, the Republic of Tutaria has only one computer, and, as a result, only one person can participate in the COBOL programming event at a time. However, any number of people may simultaneously participate in the pole vault and doughnut-eating competitions.\nThe event works as follows. The Supreme Leader fixes the order in which contestants get access to the computer. At time 0, the first citizen in the list starts writing his or her COBOL program, while the remaining citizens wait for the computer to be free. As soon as the first citizen is done, he or she proceeds to the pole vault, and the second citizen gets the computer for the programming round. In general whenever the computer becomes free, the next citizen gets to use it.

Citizens who take less time in COBOL should do that first, as this frees up the computer sooner.\n    - For pole vaults and doughnuts, while there are no hard dependencies post-COBOL, parallelism in these activities helps reduce the total time.\n\n5. **Implementation:**\n    - Sort the citizens based on their COBOL programming time.\n    - Use this order to calculate the end time for the entire event.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Read Input:**\n    - Read the number of citizens `N`.\n    - Read the time taken by each citizen in the COBOL programming, pole vault, and doughnut-eating tracks.\n\n2. **Sort Citizens by COBOL Time:**\n    - Sort the citizens based on their COBOL programming time in ascending order.\n\n3. **Calculate Completion Time for Each Citizen:**\n    - Calculate the time taken for each citizen to finish all tasks following the sorted order.\n\n4. **Determine the Earliest End Time:**\n    - Track the maximum end time among all citizens\u2019 calculated completion times.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the above algorithm:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    N = int(data[0])\n    citizens = []\n\n    index = 1\n    for i in range(N):\n        cobol = int(data[index])\n        pole_vault = int(data[index + 1])\n        doughnut = int(data[index + 2])\n        total = cobol + pole_vault + doughnut\n        citizens.append((cobol, pole_vault, doughnut, total))\n        index += 3\n\n    # Sort citizens based on COBOL time\n    citizens.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Compute the total time taken for each citizen's activity\n    max_finish_time = 0\n    for i in range(N):\n        cobol_time, pole_vault_time, doughnut_time, total_time = citizens[i]\n        max_finish_time = max(max_finish_time, cobol_time + pole_vault_time + doughnut_time)\n\n    print(max_finish_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Input Reading:**\n   - We read all inputs at once and split them into a list for easy access.\n\n2. **Citizen Time Structures:**\n   - Each citizen's times for COBOL, pole vault, and doughnuts are stored along with their total time.\n\n3. **Sorting:**\n   - Citizens are sorted by their COBOL time.\n\n4. **Calculating Minimum Overall Completion Time:**\n   - By sorting, the citizens with shorter COBOL times go first, freeing the computer quicker for the next citizen.\n   - For each citizen\u2019s total completion time, update `max_finish_time`.\n\n5. **Output:**\n   - The maximum completion time among all citizens is printed as the answer.\n\nThe code is efficient and handles the constraints effectively even for large inputs (up to 200,000 citizens).", "shortest_response": "To solve the problem where the event ends as early as possible for the Republic of Tutaria, we need to schedule the citizens in such a way that the last citizen finishes their activities just at the minimum amount of time required. The key observation is that in this problem, only one citizen can be at the computer at any point in time, but multiple citizens can be doing their pole vaults and doughnut-eating simultaneously.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how you can approach this problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Critical Constraints:**\n   - Only one citizen can program at a time.\n   - All citizens need to finish their pole vault and doughnut-eating activities sequentially, but these activities can overlap for different citizens.\n\n2. **Sorting the Citizens:**\n   - Sorting citizens primarily on the time taken for the programming track will ensure that the most efficient users get access to the computer first.\n   - Once sorted, we can compute the critical path length by considering the sequential nature of activities.\n\n### Key Idea:\n- The critical path in this problem will be determined by how efficiently the citizens use the shared computer.\n- Once citizens are sorted by their programming time, the next step is to calculate the end time by processing the activities in order to ensure the minimal total time for all citizens.\n\n### Implementation:\nHere's how you can implement the above approach:\n\n```python\ndef find_earliest_finish_time(citizens):\n    citizens.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Initialize the total time and the waiting time\n    total_time = 0\n    waiting_time = 0\n\n    # Each citizen needs to finish their programming, pole vault, and doughnut-eating\n    for time in citizens:\n        total_time += time[0]\n        waiting_time += time[1]\n        total_time = max(total_time, waiting_time + time[2])\n\n    return total_time\n\n# Input\nN = int(input())\ncitizens = []\nfor _ in range(N):\n    t = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    citizens.append(t)\n\n# Output\nprint(find_earliest_finish_time(citizens))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Implementation:\n1. **Sorting the Citizens:**\n   - Citizens are sorted based on the time taken for the programming activity, ensuring those who finish it quickly get priority.\n\n2. **Calculating the Total Time:**\n   - We iterate through each citizen and update the total time.\n   - The `total_time` starts with the first citizen's programming time.\n   - We then sequentially add the pole vault and doughnut-eating times, ensuring we pick the maximum cumulative time at each step to avoid underestimation.\n\nBy following this approach, the program efficiently computes the earliest finish time by leveraging the priority of the fastest programmers and the simultaneous execution of pole vaulting and doughnut-eating activities.

Usually, a caterpillar sits on leaf, eats as much of it as it can (or wants), then stretches out to its full length to reach a new leaf with its front end, and finally \"hops\" to it by contracting its back end to that leaf.\nWe have with us a very long, straight branch of a tree with leaves distributed uniformly along its length, and a set of caterpillars sitting on the first leaf. (Well, our leaves are big enough to accommodate upto $20$ caterpillars!). As time progresses our caterpillars eat and hop repeatedly, thereby damaging many leaves. Not all caterpillars are of the same length, so different caterpillars may eat different sets of leaves. We would like to find out the number of leaves that will be undamaged at the end of this eating spree. We assume that adjacent leaves are a unit distance apart and the length of the caterpillars is also given in the same unit.\nFor example suppose our branch had $20$ leaves (placed $1$ unit apart) and $3$ caterpillars of length $3, 2$ and $5$ units respectively. Then, first caterpillar would first eat leaf $1$, then hop to leaf $4$ and eat it and then hop to leaf $7$ and eat it and so on. So the first caterpillar would end up eating the leaves at positions $1,4,7,10,13,16$ and $19$. The second caterpillar would eat the leaves at positions $1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17$ and $19$. The third caterpillar would eat the leaves at positions $1,6,11$ and $16$. Thus we would have undamaged leaves at positions $2,8,12,14,18$ and $20$. So the answer to this example is $6$.\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $N$ and $K$, where $N$ is the number of leaves and $K$ is the number of caterpillars. Lines $2,3,...,K+1$ describe the lengths of the $K$ caterpillars.

This can be visualized as each caterpillar \u201cjumping\u201d every $L$ positions down the branch.\n\n3. **Mathematical Approach**:\n   - To find undamaged leaves, we should consider the combined effect of all caterpillars.\n   - The leaves that are undamaged are the leaves that are not visited by any caterpillar, meaning they are not multiples of any caterpillar's length.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   1. Parse the input to get $N$, the number of leaves, and $K$, the number of caterpillars.\n   2. Read the lengths of each caterpillar.\n   3. Calculate which leaves should be considered as potential damaged leaves by finding the set of positions $\\{L\\}$ where the length $L$ is among the caterpillar lengths.\n   4. Use an efficient algorithm to count how many positions are multiples of any of the length values, ensuring not to count positions that are multiples of more than one length twice.\n\n5. **Algorithm Implementation**:\n   - Use a set or a list to store the leaves that will be damaged.\n   - Iterate through all possible positions from 1 to $N$.\n   - For each caterpillar's length, add it and multiples of it (if any) that are within the range [1, N] to the set of damaged leaves.\n   - The remaining leaves are the undamaged ones.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef count_undamaged_leaves(N, caterpillars):\n    damaged_leaves = set()\n    for length in caterpillars:\n        # Add multiples of the caterpillar's length to the set\n        for i in range(1, N + 1, length):\n            damaged_leaves.add(i)\n    # The number of undamaged leaves is N minus the number of damaged leaves\n    return N - len(damaged_leaves)\n\n# Sample Input\nN = 20\nK = 3\ncaterpillars = [3, 2, 5]\n\n# Calculate undamaged leaves\nundamaged_leaves = count_undamaged_leaves(N, caterpillars)\nprint(undamaged_leaves)  # Output: 6\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- This algorithm goes through each possible length of a caterpillar.\n- For each length, it marks all positions in the leaf positions (from 1 to N) that are multiples of that length.\n- Finally, the number of undamaged leaves is the total number of leaves ($N$) minus the number of leaves that were marked as damaged.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly account for the overlaps by the use of a set to maintain the unique positions of the damaged leaves, avoiding double counting and ensuring the efficiency even for larger values of $N$.", "shortest_response": "```python\n# Given the example input and output:\nN, K = map(int, input().split())\ncat_lengths = [int(input()) for _ in range(K)]\n\n# Simulate the caterpillar's eating process\nleaves = set([i for i in range(1, N+1)])\nfor length in cat_lengths:\n    new_leaves = set()\n    for leaf in leaves:\n        if leaf + length <= N:\n            new_leaves.add(leaf + length)\n    leaves = new_leaves\n\n# Calculate the number of undamaged leaves\nundamaged_leaves = N - len(leaves)\n\nundamaged_leaves\n```", "input_size": 909, "output_sizes": [606, 242, 699, 184, 140, 700, 800, 653, 693, 694], "output_mean": 541.1, "output_std": 236.28, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 333.0, "p50": 673.0, "p75": 697.75, "p99": 791.0}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 30.95991}, {"sample_id": "f06145833f1a0d7f", "prompt_id": "9fb6274b19498769", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "Apps", "prompt_text": "QUESTION: ## Task\n\nComplete function `splitOddAndEven`, accept a number `n`(n>0), return an array that contains the continuous parts of odd or even digits.\n\nPlease don't worry about digit `0`, it won't appear ;-)\n\n## Examples\n\nYour code should start with the following: \n\ndef split_odd_and_even(n):\n\t\nThe following is the standard input and output format: \nInputs:\n[123]\n[223]\n[111]\n[13579]\n[2468642]\n[135246]\n[123456]\n[8123456]\n[82123456]\n[88123456]\nOutputs:\n[[1, 2, 3]]\n[[22, 3]]\n[[111]]\n[[13579]]\n[[2468642]]\n[[135, 246]]\n[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]]\n[[8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]]\n[[82, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]]\n[[88, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]]", "longest_response": "To solve the task of splitting the digits of a number `n` into continuous parts of odd and even digits, we need to iterate through the digits of the number and create separate lists of odd and even digits.

Each edge will be represented as a pair (vertex1, vertex2) with a weight of 1.\n\n3. **Sorting Edges**:\n    - Sort these edges by the sum of the vertices. This can be done efficiently using sorting algorithms.\n\n4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:\n    - Use a disjoint set union structure (also known as a union-find data structure) to keep track of which vertices are in the same subset.\n\n5. **Kruskal\u2019s Algorithm**:\n    - Iterate through the sorted edges and add each edge to the set if it connects two distinct sets. Keep a count of such edges added.\n    - Stop when enough edges (n-1) are selected to form the MST.\n\n6. **Output the Count**:\n    - The weight of the MST will be the number of edges added, since each edge has weight 1.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\nclass UnionFind:\n    def __init__(self, size):\n        self.parent = list(range(size))\n        self.rank = [0] * size\n\n    def find(self, x):\n        if self.parent[x] != x:\n            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])  # Path compression\n        return self.parent[x]\n\n    def union(self, x, y):\n        rootX = self.find(x)\n        rootY = self.find(y)\n        if rootX != rootY:\n            if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:\n                self.parent[rootY] = rootX\n            elif self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:\n                self.parent[rootX] = rootY\n            else:\n                self.parent[rootY] = rootX\n                self.rank[rootX] += 1\n        return rootX != rootY\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    edges = []\n\n    for i in range(2, 2 * m + 2, 2):\n        u = int(data[i]) - 1\n        v = int(data[i + 1]) - 1\n        edges.append((u, v))\n\n    # Sort edges by sum of vertices (since they are in increasing order of u)\n    edges.sort()\n\n    uf = UnionFind(n)\n    mst_weight = 0\n\n    for u, v in edges:\n        if uf.union(u, v):\n            mst_weight += 1\n\n    print(mst_weight)\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n- **Union-Find Implementation**:\n    - `find(x)`: Finds the root of the set containing `x` with path compression.\n    - `union(x, y)`: Unites the sets containing `x` and `y` if they are different.\n    - `parent` keeps the parent of each node.\n    - `rank` helps in union by rank to maintain balanced trees.\n\n- **Reading Input**:\n    - Using `sys.stdin.read` for efficient reading in competitive programming settings.\n\n- **Sorting**:\n    - Edges are sorted based on the first vertex `u` to ensure that in each step we pick minimum weight edges first.\n\n- **Kruskal\u2019s Algorithm**:\n    - The primary loop iterates through the sorted edges and uses union-find to check if the two vertices belong to different sets.\n    - If they do, the edge is added to the MST.\n\n- **Output**:\n    - Finally, the count of added edges gives the weight of the MST.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle the problem efficiently even for the maximum constraints.", "shortest_response": "To determine the weight of the minimum spanning tree in an undirected weighted graph, where each pair of vertices is connected by an edge (a complete graph) and each edge has a weight of either 0 or 1, we need to realize that the task simplifies considerably given the nature of the graph.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Completeness**: Since we are given that it is a complete graph, every pair of vertices is connected.\n2. **Edge Weights**: The edges either have a weight of 0 or 1, and there are exactly \\(m\\) edges with weight 1.\n3. **Number of Edges**: A complete graph \\(K_n\\) on \\(n\\) vertices has \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) edges, which simplifies to \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\).

In the game for developers, you should find the number of possible results of soccer for dogs.\nFind this number of possible results modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. Two results of soccer for dogs (sequences of dogs' numbers) are considered different if these sequences have different lengths or if there is a valid index i$i$ such that the i$i$-th dog in one sequence is different from the i$i$-th dog in the other sequence.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases.

We are given multiple test cases where we need to analyze the possible sequences of dogs receiving the ball before a goal is scored.\n\n### Explanation and Approach\n\nGiven the constraints and the complexity of calculating all permutations manually, an efficient algorithm is required. Here, we leverage the insight that the skill level of each dog dictates the range in which the ball can be passed, and strategically determine how far the ball can travel from a given point.\n\nThe problem can be approached by understanding how each dog's skill level affects its ability to pass the ball to other dogs within a certain range. By treating the skill levels and positions of the dogs, we can use dynamic programming to count the valid sequences.\n\n#### Key Observations:\n1. **Skill Levels Control Passes**: Each dog with skill level 1 can pass the ball only to an adjacent dog, and each dog with skill level 2 can pass it further.\n2. **Ball Passing from Start to End**: The ball starts with dog 1 and we need to consider all sequences that end with a goal scored by any dog.\n\n#### Dynamic Programming Approach:\n- We maintain a DP table where `dp[i]` can store the number of ways to cover the segment from position `1` to `i`.\n- For each position `i`, the number of ways to pass the ball to it and subsequently cover the segment from `i` to `k` up to the end can be computed based on the skill levels.\n\nBy iteratively updating the DP table based on the current dog's skill level, we can compute the number of ways to cover the sequence ending with each dog.\n\n### Implementation\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef count_results(N, skills):\n    dp = [0] * (N + 1)\n    dp[1] = 1  # Base case: there is exactly one way to complete the initial segment with dog 1\n\n    for i in range(2, N + 1):\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]\n        if i > 1 and dp[i - 1] > 0:\n            dp[i] += dp[i - 1]\n            if i > 2:\n                if dp[i - 2] > 0:\n                    dp[i] += dp[i - 2]\n\n        # Adjust for skill levels to ensure the sum doesn't exceed the modulo value\n        if dp[i] > MOD:\n            dp[i] = dp[i] % MOD\n        if dp[i] < 0:\n            dp[i] = 0  # To handle any overflow correctly\n\n    for i in range(1, N):\n        if skills[i] == 1 and dp[i + 1] > 0:\n            dp[i + 1] = 0  # Reset dp[i+1] since skill level 1 can only pass to adjacent dogs\n        if skills[i] == 1:\n            dp[i + 1] = 0\n\n    # Total ways for the game to end\n    total_results = dp[N]  # Number of sequences ending at dog N\n\n    if N > 2 and dp[N - 1] > 0:\n        total_results += dp[N - 1]\n        if total_results > MOD:\n            total_results = total_results % MOD\n\n    if dp[N - 1] == 0 and total_results > MOD:\n        total_results = total_results % MOD\n\n    return total_results % MOD\n\n# Main input processing\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().strip().split()\n\n# Parse the values\nT = int(data[0])\nindex = 1\nresults = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(data[index])\n    skills = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + N + 1]))\n    index += N + 1\n    result = count_results(N, skills)\n    results.append(result)\n\n# Output results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Code:\n- The `count_results` function processes each test case.\n- The DP array `dp[i]` builds up the count of ways the ball can be passed to dog `i` considering the skill levels.\n- We ensure every operation respects the modulo constraint to keep numbers within bounds.\n- The final result for each test case is the number of sequences from dog 1 to the end of the line considering modulo 10^9 + 7 constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired results even for the upper limits of the input constraints.", "shortest_response": "Here's a Python solution using a dynamic programming approach with memoization to efficiently compute the number of possible results for soccer for dogs.

Here is the approach:\n\n- We start at the southwest corner:\n  - Move `q` units east (X-axis).\n  - Move up until it hits the north wall or a receptor along the Y-axis.\n\nGiven that the receptor positions are `(0, p-1)`, `(1, 0)`, and `(2, p-1)`, we can determine which receptor the beam will first meet.\n\nLet's implement the code:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def mirrorReflection(self, p: int, q: int) -> int:\n        if p == 1:  # Special case when the room height is only 1\n            return 1 if q == 0 else 0\n\n        if q == 0:  # Beam starts from southwest corner\n            return 0\n        if q == p:  # Beam goes directly north hitting the top wall\n            return -1\n\n        # General case\n        # Number of steps to get to the north wall\n        steps_to_north_wall = (p - 1 - (p - 1)) // (2 * max(q, 1)) * 1000007 + 1\n\n        x = 1000000 // (q + (p - 1 - q) * 2) * (q + steps_to_north_wall)\n        # Receptor number is 0 if on the left wall, 1 if on the top wall, 2 if on the right wall\n        receptor_position = x % 3\n\n        return receptor_position\n\n# Example Usage:\n# p = 2, q = 1\nsolution = Solution()\nresult = solution.mirrorReflection(2, 1)  # Output should be 2\nprint(result)\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n\n1. **Special Cases**:\n   - If `p` is 1, the beam will either hit the zero or one receptor directly.\n   - If `q` is at the edges (i.e., 0 or `p`), the laser will hit specific receptors based on its initial direction.\n\n2. **General Calculation**:\n   - Calculate the number of vertical or horizontal steps required for the laser to reflect.\n   - Determine the receptor number based on the coordinates derived from reflections.\n\nThis approach ensures we correctly determine the receptor the laser beam will first meet after a series of reflections in the square room.\n\n**Note**: The example usage demonstrates how this code applies to the sample input `[2, 1]` and should return `2` as specified.", "shortest_response": "Here's the solution written in Python:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def mirrorReflection(self, p: int, q: int) -> int:\n        if q > p - q:  # Laser ray first interacts with the north wall\n            return 2\n        else:  # Laser ray first interacts with the west wall\n            return 0\n\n# Example usage:\nsolve = Solution()\nprint(solve.mirrorReflection(2, 1))  # Output: 2\n```\n\n### Explanation\nLet's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Determine which wall the laser first interacts with:**\n   - The key observation is that the laser is emitted from the southwest corner of the room.\n   - Initially, the laser moves towards the east wall.\n\n2. **Case when the laser goes closer to the north wall:**\n   - If `q` (the distance from the southwest corner to the point where the laser first hits the east wall) is greater than half the width of the room (`p/2`), then the laser's distance to the north wall is shorter than its distance to the west wall. Thus, it will first hit the north wall and we return 2.\n\n3. **Case when the laser goes closer to the west wall:**\n   - If `q` is less than or equal to half the width of the room (`p/2`), the laser's distance to the west wall is shorter. Thus, it will first hit the west wall and we return 0.\n\nThis solution works because the laser\u2019s path forms a symmetrical pattern when reflecting off the walls.\n\n### Usage\nYou can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `mirrorReflection` method with the appropriate arguments to get the receptor number the laser hits first.\n\nFor example, the input `[p=2, q=1]` will output `2`, indicating the laser first hits receptor 2 on the north wall.", "input_size": 234, "output_sizes": [592, 563, 603, 624, 542, 640, 697, 723, 593, 402], "output_mean": 597.9, "output_std": 84.1, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 570.25, "p50": 598.0, "p75": 636.0, "p99": 720.66}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 20.30265}, {"sample_id": "cf4aa135d4cbbc37", "prompt_id": "05da69c0dae68765", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "Apps", "prompt_text": "QUESTION: A *[Hamming number][1]* is a positive integer of the form 2*i*3*j*5*k*, for some non-negative integers *i*, *j*, and *k*.\n\nWrite a function that computes the *n*th smallest Hamming number. \n\nSpecifically:\n\n  - The first smallest Hamming number is 1 = 2^(0)3^(0)5^(0)\n  - The second smallest Hamming number is 2 = 2^(1)3^(0)5^(0)\n  - The third smallest Hamming number is 3 = 2^(0)3^(1)5^(0)\n  - The fourth smallest Hamming number is 4 = 2^(2)3^(0)5^(0)\n  - The fifth smallest Hamming number is 5 = 2^(0)3^(0)5^(1)\n\nThe 20 smallest Hamming numbers are given in example test fixture.\n\nYour code should be able to compute all of the smallest 5,000 (Clojure: 2000, NASM: 13282) Hamming numbers without timing out.\n\n[1]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_number\n\nYour code should start with the following: \n\ndef hamming(n):\n\t\nThe following is the standard input and output format: \nInputs:\n\nOutputs:\n", "longest_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the \\( n \\)th smallest Hamming number.

The goal is to generate a list of these numbers in ascending order until we find the \\( n \\)th smallest one.\n\nA straightforward approach to solve the problem involves using a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently keep track of the smallest numbers at each step of the generation process.

This requires efficiently determining and counting such pairs. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this solution:\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Dynamic Calculation of XOR Subarrays**:\n    - For each possible substring, precalculate the XOR of its elements.\n    - Use a segment tree or a hash map to efficiently query and update XOR values.\n\n2. **Finding Funny Pairs**:\n    - For each starting index \\( l \\) and ending index \\( r \\) where \\( r - l + 1 \\) is even:\n        - Calculate the mid-point.\n        - Compute the required XOR conditions.\n        - Utilize the precomputed XOR values to quickly check the funny pair condition.\n\n### Detailed Explanation\n\n1. **Data Structures**:\n    - Given that \\( n \\) can be quite large (\\( 2 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5 \\)), using segment trees or binary indexed trees (BIT) are recommended for efficient updates and queries.\n    - Alternatively, dynamic programming (DP) technique using precomputed values can also be used effectively.\n\n2. **Segment Tree or BIT Implementation**:\n    -

The data is split into a list of strings for easy access.\n2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the initial values of potions are parsed and converted into lists.\n3. **Helper Function**: `reduce_potions` is a helper function to implement the reduction mechanism for the potions.\n4. **Simulating Magic Tricks**: The main loop runs for `M` steps, where we perform the reduction by half on the largest potion values available and keep track of the maximum remaining value.\n5. **Output**: The results for each test case are collected and printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all potential states for the potions after each magic trick are considered, and the minimum possible maximum value of liquid is efficiently calculated.", "shortest_response": "```python\ndef min_max_liquid(R, G, B, M, r, g, b):\n    r.sort(reverse=True)\n    g.sort(reverse=True)\n    b.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    R = len(r)\n    G = len(g)\n    B = len(b)\n\n    tR, tG, tB = 0, 0, 0\n\n    if M >= R + G + B:\n        tR = R\n        tG = G\n        tB = B\n\n        while len(r) > 1:\n            r.pop()\n            R -= 1\n        while len(g) > 1:\n            g.pop()\n            G -= 1\n        while len(b) > 1:\n            b.pop()\n            B -= 1\n    else:\n        for _ in range(M):\n            r.pop()\n            R -= 1\n            g.pop()\n            G -= 1\n            b.pop()\n            B -= 1\n\n        r = [i//2 for i in r]\n        g = [i//2 for i in g]\n        b = [i//2 for i in b]\n\n    return max(max(r), max(g), max(b))\n\nT = int(input())\nresults = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    R, G, B, M = map(int, input().split())\n    r = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    g = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    result = min_max_liquid(R, G, B, M, r, g, b)\n    results.append(result)\n\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```", "input_size": 713, "output_sizes": [749, 1003, 740, 801, 355, 971, 822, 779, 778, 869], "output_mean": 786.7, "output_std": 167.06, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 756.25, "p50": 790.0, "p75": 857.25, "p99": 1000.12}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 37.30361}, {"sample_id": "428a39012f30828a", "prompt_id": "70e36a245f514785", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "Apps", "prompt_text": "QUESTION: # Task\n let F(N) be the sum square of digits of N.

If so, it updates the exclusive time of the previous function based on the timestamp difference.\n   - It then pushes the current function onto the stack.\n   - If the event is \"end\", it calculates the exclusive time for the current function, pops it from the stack, and updates `prev_time`.\n\n3. **Return the Result:**\n   - Finally, the exclusive times are returned for each function.\n\nThis solution works by breaking down the logs into \"start\" and \"end\" events, keeping track of the active functions using a stack, and calculating the exclusive time by accounting for the time spent within the nested function calls correctly.", "input_size": 448, "output_sizes": [730, 624, 484, 732, 640, 577, 643, 599, 612, 760], "output_mean": 640.1, "output_std": 78.74, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 602.25, "p50": 632.0, "p75": 708.25, "p99": 757.48}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 24.03117}, {"sample_id": "516e1c70a1c281d2", "prompt_id": "6b15a3069f8ed303", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "Apps", "prompt_text": "QUESTION: From wikipedia  \n\nIn number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive integer n, also called an integer partition, \nis a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers. \nTwo sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the **same** partition.\n\nFor example, 4 can be partitioned in five distinct ways:\n\n`4, 3 + 1, 2 + 2, 2 + 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1`.\n\nWe can write:\n\n`enum(4) -> [[4],[3,1],[2,2],[2,1,1],[1,1,1,1]]` and\n\n`enum(5) -> [[5],[4,1],[3,2],[3,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]`.\n\nThe number of parts in a partition grows very fast.\nFor n = 50 number of parts is `204226`, for 80 it is `15,796,476`\nIt would be too long to tests answers with arrays of such size.

A green number is one where its square ends with the same digits as the number itself. For the function to return the nth green number, we need to identify and count such numbers until we reach the nth green number.\n\nGiven the constraints for different programming languages, let's dive into building the solution.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Detailed Calculation:** We should calculate \\( N^2 \\) for each number and check if the last `len(N)` digits (or effectively the same digits as \\( N \\)) are the same in both \\( N \\) and \\( N^2 \\).\n2. **Handling Edge Cases:** Particularly, very large integers may need specific handling if we're working in a language that doesn't handle arbitrary-precision integers natively.\n3. **Efficiency:** We should aim for an efficient approach given the upper limit on \\( n \\).\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Loop through numbers starting from 1, calculating \\( N^2 \\) and comparing.**\n2. **Keep track of the green numbers and return the nth one.**\n\nHere's the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef green(n):\n    # Define a function to get the last N digits of a number\n    def last_n_digits(num, n):\n        # Using string conversion for easier slicing\n        return str(num)[-n:]\n\n    # Start with 1st green number\n    g_number = 1\n    green_count = 1\n\n    # Iterate to find the nth green number\n    while green_count < n:\n        g_number += 1\n        if last_n_digits(g_number**2, len(str(g_number))) == str(g_number):\n            green_count += 1\n\n    # Return the nth green number as a string\n    return str(g_number)\n\n# Example usage\nprint(green(1))  # Output: \"1\"\nprint(green(2))  # Output: \"5\"\nprint(green(3))  # Output: \"6\"\nprint(green(4))  # Output: \"25\"\nprint(green(5))  # Output: \"2890625\"\nprint(green(6))  # Output: \"7109376\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition:** `green(n)` is the function that finds the nth green number.\n2. **Helper Function:** `last_n_digits(num, n)` is a helper to get the last `n` digits of a number.\n3. **Main Loop:** We increment from 1 until we find the nth green number. For each number, we check if it is green by comparing its last `len(str(g_number))` digits to itself squared.\n4. **Output:** The function returns the nth green number as a string.\n\n### Optimization Note:\nGiven the large upper limit of \\( n \\) in JavaScript (\\( n \\leq 3000 \\)), the current simple solution should work, but for extremely high \\( n \\) values and more performance optimization, algorithmic enhancements or mathematical insights (possibly involving number theory) could be beneficial.", "shortest_response": "To solve the problem of finding the `n`th green number, we need to identify numbers whose squares end with the digits of the number itself.

Essentially, we need to look for numbers whose corresponding digits match up in \\( N^2 \\).\n\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: We can iterate through possible last digits of \\( N \\) and check if they satisfy the condition. The digits to check are from 0 to 9 because \\( N \\) must be a non-negative integer.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Since the constraint \\( N \\leq 5000 \\) in most cases, we can handle this with basic arithmetic operations without needing complex number theory.\n\n4. **Implementation**: The solution involves iterating through the required range and checking each number for the green property.\n\nHere's the Python implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef green(n):\n    def is_green(num):\n        power = str(num ** 2)\n        return power.endswith(str(num))\n\n    count = 0\n    num = 1\n    while count < n:\n        if is_green(num):\n            count += 1\n        num += 1\n\n    return str(num - 1)\n\n# Examples\nprint(green(1))  # Output may vary depending on the input\nprint(green(2))  # Output may vary depending on the input\nprint(green(3))  # Output may vary\nprint(green(5))  # Output may vary\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **is_green Function**: This function checks if a number `num` is green by calculating `num^2` and checking if it ends with the digits of `num`.\n- **Main Loop**: We initialize a counter `count` and start iterating through numbers.

This involves identifying and removing the words \"egg\" that have been inserted after each consonant.\n\nHere's how we can approach the problem:\n\n1. We need to define what a consonant is. Typically, consonants are any letter that is not a vowel.\n2. We'll use a regular expression (regex) to find occurrences of \"egg\" and remove them.\n3. By iterating over the characters and removing the \"egg\" words, we can construct the original string.\n\nLet's start by coding this approach using the `re` module to help with the regex operations.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef unscramble_eggs(eggcoded_str):\n    # Define the pattern to match \"egg\" following a consonant\n    pattern = r'(?<=')([bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ])(egg)'\n\n    # Use regex sub to find all instances of \"egg\" following a consonant and remove them\n    uncoded_str = re.sub(pattern, '', eggcoded_str)\n\n    return uncoded_str\n\n# Test cases\nprint(unscramble_eggs('ceggodegge heggeregge'))  # Output: ['code here']\nprint(unscramble_eggs('FeggUNegg KeggATeggA'))  # Output: ['FUN KATA']\nprint(unscramble_eggs('egegggegg'))  # Output: ['egg']\nprint(unscramble_eggs('Heggeleggleggo weggoreggleggdegg'))  # Output: ['Hello world']\nprint(unscramble_eggs('seggceggreggameggbeggleggedegg egegggeggsegg'))  # Output: ['scrambled eggs']\nprint(unscramble_eggs('egegggeggyegg beggreggeadegg'))  # Output: ['eggy bread']\nprint(unscramble_eggs('veggegeggyeggmeggitegge onegg teggoaseggtegg'))  # Output: ['vegymite on toast']\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We're using a regex pattern `(?<=')([bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ])(egg)` which matches the sequence:\n  1. A lookbehind `(?<=\u2026)` ensuring there is a consonant before.\n  2. The exact word \"egg\".\n- The `re.sub()` function replaces all such matches with an empty string, effectively removing the \"egg\".\n\nHowever, the way \"egg\" is inserted (every consonant followed by \"egg\") is a bit different. To cater to that, the solution has to be tailored specifically. Here\u2019s a refined version that handles this:\n\n```python\ndef unscramble_eggs(eggcoded_str):\n    result = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(eggcoded_str):\n        if eggcoded_str[i:i+4] == 'egg':\n            i += 4\n        else:\n            result.append(eggcoded_str[i])\n            i += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(unscramble_eggs('ceggodegge heggeregge'))  # Output: ['code here']\nprint(unscramble_eggs('FeggUNegg KeggATeggA'))  # Output: ['FUN KATA']\nprint(unscramble_eggs('egegggegg'))  # Output: ['egg']\nprint(unscramble_eggs('Heggeleggleggo weggoreggleggdegg'))  # Output: ['Hello world']\nprint(unscramble_eggs('seggceggreggameggbeggleggedegg egegggeggsegg'))  # Output: ['scrambled eggs']\nprint(unscramble_eggs('egegggeggyegg beggreggeadegg'))  # Output: ['eggy bread']\nprint(unscramble_eggs('veggegeggyeggmeggitegge onegg teggoaseggtegg'))  # Output: ['vegymite on toast']\n```\n\n### Simplified Approach:\n- Traverse the string character by character.\n- If a substring of 4 characters (i.e., 'egg') is found, skip it and increment the index by 4.\n- Otherwise, add the character to the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that each \"egg\" inserted after a consonant is correctly identified and removed, reconstructing the original uncoded string.", "shortest_response": "To solve this problem, we need to remove the string \"egg\" after each consonant in the given word.

This approach ensures efficient and accurate calculation of operations required.", "shortest_response": "To solve the problem of determining how many operations it will take for Limak to destroy all towers, we need to focus on the concept of internal and boundary blocks.\n\nIn each operation, Limak destroys all boundary blocks. The key observation is that a block is called internal if it has all four neighbors. Therefore, after each operation, the only remaining blocks are those in the center (which have four neighbors).\n\nTo determine the number of operations needed to destroy all towers, we can use the following insight:\n\n### Key Insight:\n1. For a block to be completely destroyed, it must eventually lose all its neighboring four blocks.\n2. Each operation removes all boundary blocks. So, each operation transforms the structure.\n\n### Solution Strategy:\n1. **Initial Observation**:\n   - The smallest value of all blocks sizes (heights of towers) in the input gives the number of operations needed. This is because each operation reduces the height by the lowest height possible.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. Read the number of towers \\( n \\).\n2. Read the heights \\( h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_n \\).\n3. Find the minimum height among \\( h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_n \\).\n4. This minimum height essentially tells us how many operations are required to destroy all towers. Each operation will reduce the height of the remaining structures by the minimum height.\n\n### Example:\nIf \\( h \\) represents the minimum height among all blocks, after \\( h \\) operations, all height \\( 1 \\) blocks would be destroyed, because they would be the boundary blocks in the subsequent operations until they are all gone.\n\n### Python Implementation:\nHere's the Python code that realizes this logic:\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    n = int(data[0])\n    h = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, n + 1)]\n\n    result = min(h)\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input Handling**:\n   - We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once efficiently.\n2. **Data Parsing**:\n   - Convert the list of heights into integers.\n3. **Finding the Minimum Height**:\n   - Use the `min` function to find the smallest height.\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   -

Here\u2019s a step-by-step explanation for the approach:\n\n1. **Calculate the spacing between horizontal cuts and boundaries**:\n   - Include the top and bottom boundaries.\n   - Sort the horizontal cuts to easily calculate the maximum spacing between consecutive cuts (including the boundaries at 0 and h).\n   - Find the maximum spacing between consecutive cuts and the height of the cake.\n\n2. **Calculate the spacing between vertical cuts and boundaries**:\n   - Similar to the horizontal cuts, include the left and right boundaries.\n   - Sort the vertical cuts and compute the maximum spacing between consecutive cuts (including the boundaries at 0 and w).\n   - Find the maximum spacing between consecutive cuts and the width of the cake.\n\n3. **Multiply the maximum spacings to get the maximum area**.\n   - Since the maximum area can be very large, we compute the product of the maximum heights and widths modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nHere's how the code can be implemented:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxArea(self, h: int, w: int, horizontalCuts: List[int], verticalCuts: List[int]) -> int:\n\n        def max_distance(cuts, size):\n            cuts = sorted(cuts)\n            max_distance = max(cuts[-1] - cuts[0], cuts[-1] - cuts[-2])\n            for i in range(1, len(cuts)-1):\n                max_distance = max(max_distance, max(cuts[i] - cuts[i-1], cuts[i] - cuts[i+1]))\n            return max_distance\n\n        max_horizontal_space = max_distance(horizontalCuts + [0, h], h)\n        max_vertical_space = max_distance(verticalCuts + [0, w], w)\n\n        max_area = (max_horizontal_space * max_vertical_space) % (10**9 + 7)\n        return max_area\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **max_distance function**:\n   - Takes a list `cuts` and a `size` to determine the maximum distance.\n   - Sorts the cuts.\n   - Computes the maximum spacing between cuts.\n   - The function accounts for the distances at the edges by including the boundary values in the cuts list.\n\n2. **maxArea function**:\n   - Calls `max_distance` for both the horizontal and vertical cuts to find the maximum widths of the resulting pieces.\n   - Computes the final area as the product of these maximum widths and uses the modulo operation to keep the result within the constraints.\n   - Returns the maximum area modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis algorithm ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum spacing, given the boundaries and the cuts, and handle the large value constraints effectively.", "input_size": 510, "output_sizes": [832, 663, 693, 702, 699, 690, 590, 830, 780, 755], "output_mean": 723.4, "output_std": 72.04, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 690.75, "p50": 700.5, "p75": 773.75, "p99": 831.82}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 27.47784}, {"sample_id": "fdff78f3975bfea8", "prompt_id": "bccf0b446876853f", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "Apps", "prompt_text": "QUESTION: Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).\n\nExample:\n\n\nInput: S = \"ADOBECODEBANC\", T = \"ABC\"\nOutput: \"BANC\"\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n       If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string \"\".\n       If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.\n\nYour code should start with the following: \n\nclass Solution:\n    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n        \nThe following is the standard input and output format: \nInputs:\n['\"ADOBECODEBANC\"', '\"ABC\"']\nOutputs:\n\"ADOBECODEBANC\"", "longest_response": "To solve the problem of finding the minimum window in string S that contains all the characters in string T with a time complexity of O(n), you can use a sliding window approach.

Finally, we'll convert the result into a formatted string by joining the elements with commas.\n\nHere's the complete solution in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solution(args):\n    result = []\n    i = 0\n    n = len(args)\n\n    while i < n:\n        if i + 2 < n and (args[i+2] - args[i]) == 2:\n            start = args[i]\n            end = args[i+2]\n            result.append(f\"{start}-{end}\")\n            i += 3\n        else:\n            result.append(str(args[i]))\n            i += 1\n\n    return ','.join(result)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(solution([-6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20]))\n# Output: \"-6,-3-1,3-5,7-11,14,15,17-20\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty list `result` to store our formatted ranges or individual integers. We also get the length of the input list `args` as `n` for convenience.\n2. **Iteration**: We use a while loop to iterate through the input list.\n3. **Checking for Ranges**: For each element, we check if it is possible to form a range by looking forward two more elements. If it is, we format the start and end of the range as a string separated by a dash, e.g., \"start-end\".\n4. **Adding Elements to Result**: If a range is found, we add it to `result` and increment the index by three (to skip the three numbers in the current range). If no range is found, we add the current number as a string to the result and increment the index by one.\n5. **Final Formatting**: Convert the list `result` into a single formatted string by joining all elements with commas.\n\nThis solution efficiently builds the range-extraction format by iterating through the list of integers only once, ensuring that the desired format is correctly produced.", "input_size": 563, "output_sizes": [587, 672, 637, 603, 619, 573, 679, 542, 723, 676], "output_mean": 631.1, "output_std": 53.53, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 591.0, "p50": 628.0, "p75": 675.0, "p99": 719.04}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 23.92449}, {"sample_id": "e42ac58c2f6d57f8", "prompt_id": "dff479d6135b3854", "model": "mistralai--Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410", "dataset": "Apps", "prompt_text": "QUESTION: Write a function that takes an array/list of numbers and returns a number such that \n\nExplanation\ntotal([1,2,3,4,5]) => 48\n\n1+2=3--\\ 3+5 =>     8 \\\n2+3=5--/ \\            ==  8+12=>20\\     \n          ==>5+7=> 12 / \\           20+28 => 48\n3+4=7--\\ /            == 12+16=>28/\n4+5=9--/ 7+9 =>     16  /\n\n\nif total([1,2,3]) => 8 then \n\n\nfirst+second => 3 \\\n                   then 3+5 => 8\nsecond+third => 5 /\n\n\n### Examples\n```python\ntotal([-1,-1,-1]) => -4\ntotal([1,2,3,4])  => 20\n```\n\n**Note:** each array/list will have at least an element and all elements will be valid numbers.\n\nYour code should start with the following: \n\ndef total(arr):\n\t\nThe following is the standard input and output format: \nInputs:\n[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]\n[[1, 2, 3, 4]]\n[[1, 2, 3]]\n[[4, 4, 52, 23, 32, 1, -1]]\n[[4, 4, 5, -1]]\n[[-1, -1, -1]]\n[[-1, -1, -10, 42, 92, 1, 23, 6, -3]]\n[[-1, 1, -1, 1]]\n[[42]]\nOutputs:\n[48]\n[20]\n[8]\n[1753]\n[30]\n[-4]\n[9248]\n[0]\n[42]", "longest_response": "To solve the problem where you need to achieve a specific total given an array of numbers, let's break down the process.

Here is the Python function to compute the Hofstadter Q sequence:\n\n```python\ndef hofstadter_Q(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n\n    # Base case: the first two values of the sequence\n    sequence = [1, 1]\n\n    # Compute the sequence up to the n-th term\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        # Determine the two previous indices to sum\n        idx1 = i - sequence[-1]\n        if idx1 < 0:\n            idx1 = 0\n        idx2 = i - sequence[-2]\n\n        # Sum the corresponding values from the sequence\n        new_value = sequence[idx1] + sequence[idx2]\n        sequence.append(new_value)\n\n    return sequence\n\n# Test cases\nprint(hofstadter_Q(1))  # Output: [1]\nprint(hofstadter_Q(3))  # Output: [1, 1, 2]\nprint(hofstadter_Q(7))  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(hofstadter_Q(10))  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7]\nprint(hofstadter_Q(100))  # Output might be very large if run in interpreter, check the sequence length\nprint(hofstadter_Q(1000))  # Output might be very large if run in interpreter, check with an appropriate environment\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We start with the base values `[1, 1]`.\n2. **Recursive Calculation**: For each subsequent term `i`, we determine the indices `idx1` and `idx2` of the two terms we need to sum. These indices are calculated based on the formula `i - sequence[-1]` and `i - sequence[-2]` respectively.\n3. **Base Case Handling**: If the computed indices `idx1` or `idx2` are less than 0, they are reset to 0.\n4. **Appending New Value**: Compute the sum of the two terms at the retrieved indices and append the result as the new term in the sequence.\n\nThis function successfully computes the Hofstadter Q sequence up to the n-th term based on the described rules.", "shortest_response": "To implement the Hofstadter Q sequence, we need to understand its recursive construction.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n- Motu initially has 1 red ball and 1 black ball.\n- He needs to buy `x - 1` more red balls and `y - 1` more black balls.\n- The condition is that if Motu has `R` red balls and `B` black balls, he can buy `B` red balls or `R` black balls in one operation.\n- This operation can occur an arbitrary number of times.\n\n### Analysis and Conditions\n- Initially, Motu has 1 red ball and 1 black ball, i.e., `R = 1`, `B = 1`.\n- The goal is to eventually have `x` red balls and `y` black balls.\n\n#### Scenario to Check\nGiven the operation rules and the fact that both red and black balls can be purchased in one of the two operations:\n- `B = R` and `B = x - 1`\n- `R = B` and `R = y - 1`\n\nThus the possible scenarios are:\n1. `B` should be equal to `R` ultimately, because we can balance the number of red and black balls by repeated operations.\n2. Each time we perform an operation, we are increasing one type by the total number of the other type.\n\nConsidering Motu needs specific numbers of balls:\n\n- If `x - 1` and `y - 1` differ in parity (one is odd the other is even), it will not be possible to achieve the desired number of balls since the operation would maintain the balance between `R` and `B`.\n\n### Algorithmic Approach\nTo check whether the task is possible or not:\n- Simply compare the parity (odd/even nature) of `x - 1` and `y - 1`.\n- If both values have the same parity, then output `'YES'`.\n- If they have different parity, output `'NO'`.\n\n### Implementation\nBased on the above analysis, the algorithm is straightforward:\n1. Take the number of test cases.\n2. For each test case:\n   - Calculate `x - 1` and `y - 1`.\n   - Check the parity of both results.\n   - Output `'YES'` if their parities match, otherwise `'NO'`.\n\nHere's the Python code to accomplish this:\n\n```python\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\nindex = 0\nT = int(data[index])\nindex += 1\nresults = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    x = int(data[index])\n    y = int(data[index+1])\n    index += 2\n\n    if (x - 1) % 2 == (y - 1) % 2:\n        results.append('YES')\n    else:\n        results.append('NO')\n\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We read all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` to optimize handling the large number of test cases.\n- For each test case, we extract `x` and `y`, calculate the adjusted values `x - 1` and `y - 1`, and compare their parities.\n- We append the results to the `results` list and finally print all results after processing all test cases.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the possibility of completing the task as per the given conditions.", "shortest_response": "To solve the problem of determining whether Motu can meet the conditions set by the coach using only the given operations and number of balls, we need to carefully analyze the operations allowed. The allowed operations allow Motu to either:\n\n1. Add red balls up to the number of black balls he currently has, or\n2. Add black balls up to the number of red balls he currently has.\n\nBy understanding this, the approach becomes clear: we need to find a way to determine if Motu can eventually end up with exactly \\( x-1 \\) red balls and \\( y-1 \\) black balls.\n\nGiven the constraints, checking for each test case if the operations will suffice is the core of the solution. A detailed analysis shows that:\n- If \\( x-1 + y-1 \\) (which represents the total number of balls required beyond the initial one red and one black ball) is an even number (i.e., \\( (x + y - 2) \\) is even), then it can be achieved using the allowed operations.\n\nThe operations:\n- Add red balls \\( \\leq B \\).\n- Add black balls \\( \\leq R \\).\n\nThese operations can be considered as:\n1. Incrementing the number of red balls by up to the number of current black balls.\n2. Incrementing the number of black balls by up to the number of current red balls.\n\nIf we start from one red and one black, we can add reds using available blacks, and add blacks using available reds repeatedly until we have the required number of balls of each color.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n1. Calculate the difference \\( (x + y - 2) \\) for each test case.\n2. Check if this difference is even.\n3.

Use dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently count valid words.\n\n4. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**\n   Use a DP table where each entry `dp[i][j]` represents the number of reachable words ending with character `j` of length `i`.\n   - Initialize `dp[0][0]` as 1 since an empty word can be considered valid initially.\n   - Fill the DP table based on the adjacency matrix.\n\n5. **Result Calculation:**\n   Sum up the counts from the DP table to get the number of valid words of length `L` ending with `C`.\n\n6. **Modulo Operation:**\n   Since the result might be very large, return it modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Implementation\n\nHere's the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ndef count_valid_words(T, input_matrix, queries):\n    N = len(input_matrix)\n\n    dp = defaultdict(lambda: [0] * 2)\n    dp[0][0] = 1  # Initial state\n\n    for i in range(N):\n        dp.append([0] * 2)\n        for j in range(N):\n            if input_matrix[i][j] == 1:\n                dp[i + 1].append((dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % MOD)\n                dp[i + 1][2] = dp[i][2]  # carry\n\n    results = []\n    for C, L in queries:\n        if C == 'a':\n            C = 0\n        else:\n            C = ord(C) - ord('a')\n        word = dp[L + 1][2]\n        result = word % MOD\n        results.append(result)\n\n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = [\n        '0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0',\n        '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0'\n    ]\n\n    input_matrix = [[int(x) for x in row.split()] for row in input_data]\n    T = int(input_data[-1][-1])\n    queries = [tuple(input_data[-2][::2] + [list(ord(C) - ord('a') + 1) for C in input_data[-1].strip().split())) for _ in range(T)]\n\n    results = count_valid_words(T, input_matrix, queries)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input Handling:**\n   - Convert the input lines into an integer matrix.\n   - Parse the queries.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization:**\n   - Initialize the DP table considering all transitions according to the adjacency matrix.\n\n3. **Query Processing:**\n   - For each query, determine the valid paths and compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach ensures an efficient computation of the number of valid words up to the required length while keeping the solution manageable within the constraints.", "shortest_response": "Based on the problem description, we need to compute the number of possible words of length \\(L\\) ending with a character \\(C\\) given a grid of constraints specifying which characters can follow which other characters.\n\nThe key observation is that this problem can be mapped to graph traversal where each character is a node and the edges represent the possible transitions specified in the problem constraints.
