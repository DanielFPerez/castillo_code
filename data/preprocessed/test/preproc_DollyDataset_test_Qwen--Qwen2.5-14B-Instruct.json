There isn't a single \"best\" bidding system as it often depends on the players' preferences, strengths, and playing style. However, some systems are more popular and widely recognized for their effectiveness:\n\n1. **Standard American Yellow Card (SAYC):** This is one of the most common bidding systems used in Duplicate Bridge. It's relatively straightforward and provides a good balance between describing hand strength and shape. SAYC includes conventions such as Blackwood and Gerber for slam bidding, and Stayman for finding a 4-4 major suit fit.\n\n2. **2/1 Game Forcing:** A variant of SAYC, this system is known for its efficiency and flexibility. It uses strong, artificial 2-level openings and a 1-of-a-major response to show a 4-card or longer suit. The system is particularly praised for its handling of strong hands and its ability to find game contracts.\n\n3. **Five Card Majors:** Similar to SAYC but with a slightly different approach to opening bids. In this system, a 1-level bid of a major suit promises at least five cards in that suit. It's favored by many for its simplicity and directness in showing hand strength and distribution.\n\n4. **Acol System:** Popular in the UK and other parts of Europe, the Acol system is similar to SAYC but has some differences in how it handles weak two-bids and other conventions.\n\n5. **Precision Club:** This is a more aggressive and complex system, often preferred by experts. Precision involves strong, artificial 1-level openings and a highly structured rebidding scheme. It requires a high level of partnership understanding and practice but can be very effective when mastered.\n\nChoosing the \"best\" system really depends on what works best for you and your partner. Many pairs will choose a system based on their strengths and weaknesses, their communication style, and their goals in the game.

For example, a system like Precision might be better suited for pairs looking to exploit every opportunity, while SAYC might be more appropriate for those who prefer a simpler, less error-prone approach.\n\nUltimately, the \"best\" system is one that suits your partnership's playing style and that you and your partner can execute consistently and effectively.", "input_size": 39, "output_sizes": [412, 425, 440, 340, 464, 378, 337, 314, 365, 403], "output_mean": 387.8, "output_std": 46.54, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 346.25, "p50": 390.5, "p75": 421.75, "p99": 461.84}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 17.96388}, {"sample_id": "37871a1a1a9bb677", "prompt_id": "9bc4261296d6a7da", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What are recommendations for some European cities to visit.", "longest_response": "Europe is filled with cities that offer a unique blend of history, culture, and modernity.

Here are some steps and considerations to help you decide on the type of dog you want to purchase or adopt:\n\n1. **Lifestyle Compatibility**: Consider your daily routine and lifestyle. Are you active and looking for a running or hiking companion? Or do you prefer a more relaxed pet who enjoys cuddling on the couch? Active breeds like Border Collies and Retrievers may not be suitable if you have a sedentary lifestyle.\n\n2. **Living Space**: Think about the size of your home and yard. Larger dogs need more space and often require more exercise than smaller breeds. If you live in an apartment, a small dog breed might be a better fit.\n\n3. **Allergies**: If anyone in your household has allergies, consider hypoallergenic breeds such as Poodles, Portuguese Water Dogs, or Bichon Frises. However, remember that no dog is completely hypoallergenic, and individuals react differently to different breeds.\n\n4. **Grooming Needs**: Some breeds require extensive grooming to maintain their health and appearance. Long-haired breeds like Shih Tzus and Maltese need regular brushing and trimming, while short-haired breeds like Boxers and Dobermans require less maintenance.\n\n5. **Energy Levels**: Different breeds have different energy levels. High-energy breeds like Terriers and Spaniels need plenty of physical activity and mental stimulation to thrive, whereas lower-energy breeds like Bulldogs and Mastiffs are more content with shorter walks and quiet times at home.\n\n6. **Temperament and Training**: Research the typical temperament and training requirements of various breeds. Some breeds are known for being very trainable and easy to handle, while others can be more independent or stubborn. This can greatly affect how well you bond with your dog and how easily you can manage its behavior.\n\n7. **Health Concerns**: Certain breeds are predisposed to specific health issues. For example, Dachshunds are prone to back problems, and French Bulldogs often suffer from breathing difficulties due to their flat faces. Understanding these risks can help you make an informed decision.\n\n8. **Adoption vs. Purchase**: If you're considering adoption, visit local shelters or rescue organizations. Adopting a dog can save a life and provide a loving home to a pet that needs it. When purchasing a puppy, try to buy from reputable breeders who prioritize the health and well-being of their dogs.\n\n9. **Consult Professionals**: Speak with veterinarians, trainers, or experienced dog owners who can offer insights into various breeds and help you understand what to expect.\n\n10. **Trial Period**: If possible, spend time with potential dogs before making a commitment. Many shelters allow fostering, which can give you a good idea of whether you and a particular dog are a good match.\n\nBy carefully considering these factors, you can find a dog that suits your lifestyle and preferences, ensuring a joyful and fulfilling companionship.", "shortest_response": "Choosing the right dog for you involves considering several factors to ensure that you and your new companion will be happy together. Here are some steps and considerations to help you make an informed decision:\n\n1. **Purpose**: Think about why you want a dog. Do you want a companion, a working dog, or a pet for children? Your purpose will guide you toward certain breeds that are more suitable.\n\n2. **Lifestyle**:\n   - **Activity Level**: Consider how active you are and how much exercise you can provide. Some dogs need lots of physical activity, while others are content with less.\n   - **Living Space**: Assess the size of your home and yard. Some breeds require more space than others.\n\n3. **Temperament**: Research different breeds to understand their typical temperaments. Some breeds are known for being friendly and outgoing, while others might be more reserved or protective.\n\n4. **Size**: Decide on the size of the dog that would best suit your living situation. Larger dogs may require more space and resources, whereas smaller dogs can sometimes be more suited to apartment living.\n\n5. **Health Concerns**: Be aware of common health issues in different breeds. Some breeds are prone to specific genetic conditions, which can affect their lifespan and quality of life.\n\n6. **Grooming Needs**: Different breeds have varying grooming requirements. Some dogs need daily brushing, while others might only need it weekly or monthly.\n\n7. **Cost**: Factor in the cost of food, veterinary care, grooming, and other expenses related to owning a dog. Some breeds may be more expensive to maintain due to their size or health needs.\n\n8. **Compatibility with Family Members**: If you have other pets or children, consider how well the breed you're interested in will fit into your family dynamic.\n\n9. **Research Breeds and Crossbreeds**: Look into purebred dogs as well as mixed breeds (often called mutts). Mixed breeds often combine traits from different breeds and may be less likely to develop breed-specific health problems.\n\n10. **Adoption vs. Purchase**: Decide whether you prefer to adopt from a shelter or rescue organization or purchase from a breeder. Adopting can give a homeless animal a loving home, while purchasing from a reputable breeder ensures a healthy puppy with a known lineage.\n\n11. **Meet Potential Puppies or Dogs**: If possible, meet puppies or adult dogs before making a final decision.

Hari Seldon, a mathematician and psychologist, has developed psychohistory, a new field of science and psychology that treats all possibilities in large societies by mathematics, allowing for the probabilistic prediction of future events.\n\nBy means of psychohistory, Seldon has discovered the decline and eventual fall of the Empire, angering the aristocratic members of the Commission of Public Safety, the de facto rulers of the Empire. The Commission considers Seldon's views and statements treasonous, and he is arrested along with the young mathematician Gaal Dornick, who has arrived on Trantor to join Seldon's group. Seldon is tried by the Commission; he defends his beliefs, explaining his theories and predictions, including his belief that the Empire will collapse in 300 years and while a Second Empire will eventually rise it will only come after a 30,000-year dark age. He informs the Commission that an alternative to this future is attainable and explains to them that creating a compendium of all human knowledge, the Encyclopedia Galactica, may not prevent the inevitable fall of the Empire but would reduce the dark age to one millennium.\n\nThe skeptical Commission, not wanting to make Seldon a martyr, offers him exile to a remote world, Terminus, with others who could help him create the Encyclopedia. He accepts their offer, prepares for the departure of the \"Encyclopedists\" and receives an imperial decree officially acknowledging his actions. Seldon informs Dornick that, despite the Empire's belief it won by exiling Seldon, the outcome was exactly what he had intended and hoped for.

A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by John of Aviz (later King John I of Portugal) and commanded by General Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira defeated the Castilians in the Battle of Aljubarrota. With this battle, the House of Aviz became the ruling house of Portugal.\n\nThe new ruling dynasty would proceed to push Portugal to the limelight of European politics and culture, creating and sponsoring works of literature, like the Cr\u00f3nicas d'el Rei D. Jo\u00e3o I by Fern\u00e3o Lopes, the first riding and hunting manual Livro da ensinan\u00e7a de bem cavalgar toda sela and O Leal Conselheiro both by King Edward of Portugal and the Portuguese translations of Cicero's De Oficiis and Seneca's De Beneficiis by the well traveled Prince Peter of Coimbra, as well as his magnum opus Tratado da Vertuosa Benfeytoria. In an effort of solidification and centralization of royal power the monarchs of this dynasty also ordered the compilation, organization and publication of the first three compilations of laws in Portugal: the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es d'el Rei D. Duarte, which was never enforced; the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Afonsinas, whose application and enforcement was not uniform across the realm; and the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Manuelinas, which took advantage of the printing press to reach every corner of the kingdom. The Avis Dynasty also sponsored works of architecture like the Mosteiro da Batalha (literally, the Monastery of the Battle) and led to the creation of the manueline style of architecture in the 16th century.\n\nPortugal also spearheaded European exploration of the world and the Age of Discovery. Prince Henry the Navigator, son of King John I of Portugal, became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour. During this period, Portugal explored the Atlantic Ocean, discovering the Atlantic archipelagos the Azores, Madeira, and Cape Verde; explored the African coast; colonized selected areas of Africa; discovered an eastern route to India via the Cape of Good Hope; discovered Brazil, explored the Indian Ocean, established trading routes throughout most of southern Asia; and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to China and Japan.\n\nIn 1415, Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering Ceuta, the first prosperous Islamic trade centre in North Africa. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: Madeira and the Azores, which led to the first colonization movements.\n\nIn 1422, by decree of King John I, Portugal officially abandoned the previous dating system, the Era of Caesar, and adopted the Anno Domini system, therefore becoming the last catholic realm to do so.\n\n\nThroughout the 15th century, Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for several common types of tradable commodities at the time, ranging from gold to slaves, as they looked for a route to India and its spices, which were coveted in Europe.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas, intended to resolve the dispute that had been created following the return of Christopher Columbus, was made by Pope Alexander VI, the mediator between Portugal and Spain. It was signed on 7 June 1494, and divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two countries along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa).\n\n\nIn 1498, Vasco da Gama accomplished what Columbus set out to do and became the first European to reach India by sea, bringing economic prosperity to Portugal and its population of 1.7 million residents, and helping to start the Portuguese Renaissance. In 1500, the Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real reached what is now Canada and founded the town of Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, Newfoundland and Labrador, long before the French and English in the 17th century, and being just one of many Portuguese colonizations of the Americas.\n\nIn 1500, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral discovered Brazil and claimed it for Portugal. Ten years later, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Goa in India, Muscat and Ormuz in the Persian Strait, and Malacca, now a state in Malaysia. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic. Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe, landing in such places as Taiwan, Japan, the island of Timor, and in the Moluccas.\n\nAlthough for a long period it was believed the Dutch were the first Europeans to arrive in Australia, there is also some evidence that the Portuguese may have discovered Australia in 1521. From 1519 to 1522, Ferdinand Magellan (Fern\u00e3o de Magalh\u00e3es) organized a Spanish expedition to the East Indies which resulted in the first circumnavigation of the globe. Magellan never made it back to Europe as he was killed by natives in the Philippines in 1521.\n\nThe Treaty of Zaragoza, signed on 22 April 1529 between Portugal and Spain, specified the anti-meridian to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas.\n\nAll these factors made Portugal one of the world's major economic, military, and political powers from the 15th century until the late 16th century.", "longest_response": "The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed on June 7, 1494, was an agreement between the Catholic Monarchs of Spain (Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon) and the King of Portugal (John II), mediated by the Papacy under Pope Alexander VI. This treaty aimed to resolve territorial disputes arising from the discovery of new lands during the Age of Exploration, particularly following Christopher Columbus's voyage to the New World in 1492.\n\nThe treaty essentially divided newly discovered lands outside Europe into two zones of influence and colonization for Spain and Portugal. The dividing line was set as a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands, off the west coast of Africa. All lands to the east of this line were reserved for Portugal, while those to the west were reserved for Spain. This agreement effectively split the non-European world between the two Iberian powers, although it did not prevent further conflicts or disputes over territory, especially in areas where the line was ambiguous or where territories straddled the division.\n\nThis treaty was significant because it marked the beginning of formal agreements between European powers to regulate overseas expansion and colonization. It also underscored the role of the Catholic Church in legitimizing and supporting European colonial endeavors, as the papal bull Inter caetera issued by Pope Alexander VI in 1493 had laid the groundwork for the treaty by granting Spain rights to all lands west of a certain longitude, while reserving rights to the east for Portugal.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas had far-reaching consequences for the distribution of colonial territories around the world, influencing the exploration and colonization activities of both nations for centuries to come.", "shortest_response": "The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed on June 7, 1494, was a papal-brokered agreement between Spain and Portugal aimed at resolving territorial disputes arising from their explorations in the Age of Discovery.

Lands to the west of this line were allotted to Spain, while those to the east were given to Portugal. This division was significant because it facilitated the orderly expansion of both empires and helped prevent conflict over newly discovered territories. \n\nOne of the most notable outcomes of the treaty was that it allowed Spain to claim vast territories in the Americas, including much of Central and South America, while Portugal gained control over territories in Africa, Asia, and parts of South America, notably Brazil.\n\nHowever, the Treaty of Tordesillas did not address the interests of other European powers, nor did it take into account the complex geography of the world, particularly with respect to the Pacific Ocean.

OKRs are not just about setting targets but also about fostering a culture of transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement.\n\n### Step 2: Align with Organizational Goals\nStart by understanding the broader objectives set by your organization. Your team's OKRs should align with these larger goals. This alignment ensures that your team's efforts contribute directly to the overall success of the company.\n\n### Step 3: Define Team Objectives\nObjectives are qualitative statements that describe what your team aims to achieve. They should be ambitious yet realistic, and measurable. Objectives should focus on impact rather than activity. For example:\n- \"Increase customer satisfaction scores by 10%\"\n- \"Launch a new product feature by Q4\"\n\n### Step 4: Set Key Results\nKey Results are specific, quantitative measures that indicate whether an Objective has been achieved. They should be challenging but attainable. Each Objective should have 3-5 Key Results. For example:\n- \"Objective: Increase customer satisfaction scores by 10%\"\n  - Key Result: Achieve a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 80 or higher by Q3\n  - Key Result: Reduce customer churn rate by 5% by Q4\n\n### Step 5: Involve the Team in the Process\nEngage your team members in the development of OKRs. This involvement increases buy-in and commitment. Consider holding workshops or brainstorming sessions where team members can contribute ideas and discuss potential OKRs.\n\n### Step 6: Prioritize and Refine\nNot all proposed OKRs may be feasible or aligned with organizational priorities. Use this phase to prioritize and refine the list of OKRs based on strategic importance, resource availability, and feasibility.\n\n### Step 7: Communicate and Document\nOnce finalized, communicate the OKRs clearly to all relevant stakeholders within your team and beyond. Ensure that everyone understands their role in achieving these objectives. Document the OKRs in a visible format like a shared document or digital platform so that they are accessible to all team members.\n\n### Step 8: Implement and Track Progress\nImplement the OKRs by breaking them down into actionable tasks and assigning responsibilities. Regularly track progress against each Key Result using tools like spreadsheets, project management software, or dedicated OKR tracking platforms.\n\n### Step 9: Review and Adjust\nRegular reviews are crucial to assess progress and make necessary adjustments. Schedule periodic check-ins (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to discuss what's working, what isn't, and any changes needed. Be flexible and willing to adjust OKRs if circumstances change.\n\n### Step 10: Celebrate Successes and Learn from Failures\nRecognize and celebrate achievements when Key Results are met. Also, encourage a learning mindset by discussing failures openly and using them as opportunities for growth and improvement.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively develop and implement OKRs that drive your team towards meaningful and impactful results.", "shortest_response": "Developing Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for your team is a structured way to set clear goals and measure progress effectively.

It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Here are the key components of Hadoop:\n\n1. **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)**: This is the primary storage system used in Hadoop applications. It stores large datasets across multiple nodes in a cluster. HDFS provides high throughput access to application data and is designed to be highly fault-tolerant.\n\n2. **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)**: YARN is the resource management layer of Hadoop. It manages computing resources in clusters and uses them to execute the applications submitted by the users. It is responsible for managing the resources and scheduling the tasks of the applications running on the Hadoop cluster.\n\n3. **MapReduce**: MapReduce is a software framework for easily writing applications which process vast amounts of data (typically in the range of petabytes). The name \"MapReduce\" refers to the two fundamental operations of the underlying execution engine: Map and Reduce. Map operations process a set of inputs to generate pairs (intermediate data), and Reduce operations combine those intermediate values to form a smaller set of values.\n\n4. **Hadoop Common**: This is a collection of common utilities and libraries required by other Hadoop modules. These tools provide filesystem and OS-level abstractions and contain the necessary Java Archive (JAR) files and scripts needed to start Hadoop.\n\n5. **Hadoop Ozone**: A new addition to the Hadoop ecosystem, Hadoop Ozone is an object store that can be used as an alternative or in conjunction with HDFS. It is designed to support massive numbers of small files and to provide a scalable namespace.\n\n6. **Hadoop HBase**: HBase is a NoSQL database built on top of Hadoop. It provides random read/write access to large datasets hosted in HDFS. HBase is well-suited for sparse data sets, which are common in many big data use cases.\n\n7. **Apache Hive**: Apache Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure that provides SQL-like capabilities for querying and analyzing large datasets stored in Hadoop files. Hive supports queries expressed in a language called HiveQL, which automatically translates SQL-like queries into MapReduce jobs executed on Hadoop.\n\n8. **Pig**: Pig is a platform for analyzing large datasets that consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs. The salient property of Pig programs is that their structure is amenable to substantial parallelization, which enables them to handle very large data sets.\n\n9. **Spark**: While not originally part of the core Hadoop project, Apache Spark has become a popular component used alongside Hadoop. Spark provides a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing, offering an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.\n\nThese components work together to provide a robust framework for storing, processing, and analyzing large volumes of data efficiently.", "shortest_response": "Hadoop is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models.

It manages the scheduling of tasks and the allocation of resources (memory and CPU) across the cluster. YARN enables Hadoop to run a variety of different processing frameworks alongside MapReduce, such as Spark, Tez, and Flink.\n\n3. **MapReduce**: Although it's not a standalone component anymore with the advent of YARN, MapReduce was originally the core data processing paradigm in Hadoop. It is a programming model for processing large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster. A MapReduce job usually splits the input data-set into independent chunks which are processed by the map tasks in a completely parallel manner.\n\n4. **Hadoop Common**: This is a collection of common utilities and libraries required by other Hadoop modules. It provides file system and OS level abstractions along with Java libraries for file operations and shell-like scripting.\n\n5. **Hadoop Ozone**: Introduced more recently, Hadoop Ozone is a new scalable, distributed object store built on top of HDFS.

Initially, these ships were intended for the Khedivate of Egypt, which was then an autonomous vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. However, due to political maneuvers by the central Ottoman government, Hifz-ur Rahman was commandeered while still under construction at the French shipyard Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde.\n\n- **Design and Armament**: As a turret ship, Hifz-ur Rahman featured advanced armament for its time, including two 229 mm (9-inch) Armstrong guns and two 178 mm (7-inch) Armstrong guns. These were mounted in revolving gun turrets, allowing for flexible targeting capabilities.\n\n- **Military Service**: During the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878), Hifz-ur Rahman played a role in naval operations on the Danube River. Its primary mission was to hinder Russian forces from crossing the river. Notably, Hifz-ur Rahman engaged Russian gunboats in combat near the port of Sulina, though the outcome of this engagement was inconclusive.\n\n- **Post-War Fate**: After the war, the ship was decommissioned and remained inactive for almost two decades, reflecting broader issues with the maintenance and readiness of the Ottoman fleet. This period of dormancy ended with the onset of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, when it became evident that the Ottoman naval force was in dire need of modernization.\n\n- **Reconstruction and Final Years**: In response to the identified deficiencies, a major reconstruction project was undertaken for Hifz-ur Rahman at the Imperial Arsenal. Despite these efforts, the ship did not regain prominence or engage in significant military actions thereafter. By 1909, Hifz-ur Rahman had been deemed obsolete and was eventually decommissioned and sold for scrap.\n\nOverall, Hifz-ur Rahman represents a transitional phase in Ottoman naval history, marking the shift from traditional wooden-hulled ships to more modern ironclad designs, while also highlighting the challenges faced by the Ottoman Navy in maintaining and modernizing its fleet throughout the late 19th century.", "shortest_response": "The Ottoman ironclad Hifz-ur Rahman was a significant naval asset for the Ottoman Empire during the late 19th century.

The best position to use in your flex slot depends on several factors, including your team's overall strategy, the matchups for each position, and any bye weeks that might affect your roster. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Running Back (RB):** Running backs often provide a combination of rushing yards and receiving touchdowns, which can be very valuable in fantasy football. They tend to have a high ceiling due to their ability to score both rushing and receiving touchdowns.\n\n2. **Wide Receiver (WR):** Wide receivers can be a safer option because they usually offer more consistent production through receptions and receiving yards. However, their touchdown potential might be slightly lower compared to RBs, but they are less likely to go 0-0-0 games.\n\n3. **Tight End (TE):** Tight ends can be a good choice if you have a reliable one who sees a lot of targets and has a decent touchdown threat. However, TE production can be inconsistent, so it\u2019s important to consider the specific player\u2019s role in the offense.\n\nWhen deciding, consider these additional factors:\n- **Matchups:** Look at how your players match up against their opponents.

This frame will provide the necessary structural support and shape.\n   - Ensure that the frame is lightweight yet sturdy enough to withstand the forces during takeoff, flight, and landing.\n\n2. **Duct Tape Application:**\n   - Begin by applying duct tape over the entire frame, ensuring that it covers both the fuselage and the wings.\n   - Use multiple layers of tape to create a smooth surface and add strength to the structure. Pay special attention to areas where stress is likely to be higher, such as around the wing joints and tail sections.\n   - Consider reinforcing critical areas with additional layers or strips of tape.\n\n3. **Adding Propulsion and Control Systems:**\n   - Mount motors and propellers on the frame. These should be powerful enough to lift the weight of the aircraft.\n   - Install batteries and electronic components for flight control, including a flight controller board, servos for rudder and elevator control, and any necessary sensors.\n   - Ensure all electrical connections are secure and insulated properly to prevent short circuits.\n\n4. **Wiring and Electronics:**\n   - Carefully route all wires and cables inside the duct tape-covered frame to avoid tangling or damage.\n   - Test each component individually before integrating them into the system to ensure everything works correctly.\n\n5. **Aerodynamic Design:**\n   - Shape the duct tape to form smooth curves on the wings and fuselage to reduce drag and improve lift.\n   - Add control surfaces like elevators and rudders, making sure they are covered in duct tape and connected to the control system.\n\n6. **Finishing Touches:**\n   - Seal any gaps or weak points in the duct tape with additional layers or patches.\n   - Attach landing gear and any other necessary equipment.\n   - Decorate the plane with additional duct tape or paint if desired.\n\n7. **Testing and Adjustment:**\n   - Conduct ground tests to ensure all systems work correctly.\n   - Make adjustments to the balance and control surfaces as needed.\n   - Due to the experimental nature of this design, it's crucial to test in a controlled environment and gradually increase complexity.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- **Safety:** This project should never be flown without proper safety measures and understanding of the limitations of duct tape as a material.\n- **Regulations:** Any flying object must comply with aviation laws and regulations, which typically require certified materials and rigorous testing.\n- **Educational Value:** While not practical for actual flight, this project could serve as an excellent learning experience in engineering, aerodynamics, and problem-solving.\n\nIn conclusion, while building a fully operational plane out of duct tape is impractical and unsafe, the process can be a fun and educational endeavor that teaches valuable skills in construction, engineering, and design.", "shortest_response": "Building a fully functional airplane out of duct tape is not feasible due to several critical reasons related to structural integrity, aerodynamics, and safety regulations.

Is it for flying (which is highly impractical), as a model, or as an art installation?\n   \n2. **Scale**: Consider the scale of your project. A full-sized duct-tape airplane would be extremely heavy and structurally unsound, so a smaller model would be more manageable.\n\n3. **Materials**: Besides duct tape, consider using lightweight but strong internal structures like balsa wood, foam, or carbon fiber. These will provide the necessary strength and rigidity that duct tape alone cannot offer.\n\n4. **Design**: Sketch out the design of your plane, considering basic aerodynamic principles. The fuselage should have a streamlined shape, and the wings should have a smooth curve for lift.\n\n### Construction Steps\n\n#### Step 1: Framework\n- Use lightweight materials like balsa wood or foam to create the internal framework of the fuselage and wings.\n- Ensure the framework is robust enough to hold its shape under stress.\n\n#### Step 2: Duct Tape Application\n- Begin by covering the entire framework with duct tape, layering it multiple times to ensure durability.\n- Start from the bottom and work upwards, smoothing out each layer as you go to minimize air resistance.\n\n#### Step 3: Wing and Tail Assembly\n- Construct the wings and tail sections separately, applying duct tape in the same manner as the fuselage.\n- Attach these components to the main body using additional layers of duct tape, ensuring they are securely fastened.\n\n#### Step 4: Finishing Touches\n- Add any necessary details such as control surfaces (ailerons, elevators) using small pieces of duct tape.\n- Decorate the exterior with patterns or colors for aesthetic appeal.\n\n### Safety and Practicality Considerations\n- This project is purely for fun or artistic expression. It should never be flown with humans aboard.\n- If intended as a model, it could be tested in a wind tunnel or used as a remote-controlled aircraft for hobby purposes, but even then, extensive modifications would be required beyond just duct tape.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile building an airplane entirely out of duct tape is not practical or safe, creating a scaled-down model for educational or artistic purposes can be an engaging project.

The earliest known Easter egg in software in general is one placed in the \"make\" command for PDP-6/PDP-10 computers sometime in October 1967\u2013October 1968, wherein if the user attempts to create a file named \"love\" by typing \"make love\", the program responds \"not war?\" before proceeding.", "longest_response": "The concept of Easter eggs in video games has its roots in the early days of computing and entertainment, with the term \"Easter egg\" itself being popularized within the context of software and video games in the late 1970s.\n\nThe term \"Easter egg\" in this context was coined around 1979 by Steve Wright, who was the Director of Software Development at Atari's Consumer Division. He used the term to describe a hidden message within the video game \"Adventure,\" released in 1979 for the Atari 2600 console. This hidden message referenced the developers of the game, much like how an Easter egg hunt involves finding hidden items.\n\nHowever, while the term became widely recognized from this point onwards, the practice of hiding secret features or messages within software predates the use of the term \"Easter egg.\" One of the earliest known instances of what could be considered an Easter egg in a video game dates back to 1973 with the game \"Moonlander.\" In this game, players attempt to land a lunar module on the moon. If the player navigates their module horizontally across multiple screens, they can find a McDonald's restaurant. Landing near this location causes the astronaut to visit the restaurant rather than staying beside the spacecraft, which is a playful nod to real-world branding and a hidden feature for observant players.\n\nIn software development, the earliest known Easter egg is found in the \"make\" command for PDP-6/PDP-10 computers. This Easter egg appeared sometime between October 1967 and October 1968. When a user tried to create a file named \"love\" by entering \"make love,\" the system would respond with \"not war?\" before proceeding with the operation. This playful response introduced the idea of adding humorous or unexpected elements into software, setting a precedent for future developers to include similar surprises.\n\nThese examples illustrate that while the specific term \"Easter egg\" became popular in the late 1970s, the concept of hiding fun or informative surprises within software and video games had been around for some time prior.", "shortest_response": "The concept of Easter eggs in video games and other digital media has its roots in the early days of computing and game development.

Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995, Vapnik et al., 1997[citation needed]) SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods, being based on statistical learning frameworks or VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974). Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n\nIn addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\nThe support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data.[citation needed] These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data to groups and, then, to map new data according to these clusters.", "longest_response": "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful models used in machine learning for both classification and regression tasks, but they are particularly well-known for classification problems. The concept was developed by Vladimir Vapnik and his colleagues at AT&T Bell Laboratories in the early 1990s. SVMs operate on the principle of finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points from different classes in a multi-dimensional space. This hyperplane is chosen to have the maximum margin from the nearest data points of any class, known as support vectors. Maximizing this margin leads to better generalization of the model to unseen data.\n\nHere's a breakdown of key aspects of SVMs:\n\n1. **Binary Classification**: SVMs are primarily used for binary classification tasks where the goal is to classify data points into one of two classes. However, they can be extended to handle multi-class problems through various strategies like one-vs-one or one-vs-all approaches.\n\n2. **Hyperplane and Margin**: In a two-dimensional space, a hyperplane is simply a line that divides the plane into two parts. For higher dimensions, it's a subspace of one dimension less than the full space. The margin around the hyperplane is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class (support vectors). SVM aims to maximize this margin to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.\n\n3. **Non-linear Classification via Kernel Trick**: While SVMs are fundamentally designed for linear separation, the kernel trick allows them to handle non-linearly separable data. By transforming the original input space into a higher-dimensional space, SVMs can find a hyperplane that correctly separates the data. Common kernels include linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid kernels.\n\n4. **Soft Margin Classification**: Real-world datasets often contain noise and outliers that make perfect separation difficult. To address this, SVMs incorporate a soft margin approach, allowing some misclassification in exchange for a larger margin. This is controlled by a parameter \\(C\\) which balances the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the classification error.\n\n5. **Support Vectors**: These are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary (the hyperplane). They are critical because changing their position would alter the position of the hyperplane. All other data points have no effect on the model once the optimal hyperplane is found.\n\n6. **Applications**: SVMs have been successfully applied in various fields including bioinformatics (for protein sequence classification), text (and hypertext) categorization, image classification, and hand-written character recognition system.\n\nIn summary, SVMs are versatile tools in machine learning that excel in scenarios requiring precise classification boundaries, especially when dealing with complex, non-linear relationships within data. Their strength lies in their ability to generalize well to unseen data, thanks to the principle of maximizing the margin between classes.", "shortest_response": "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful supervised learning models used primarily for classification and regression tasks in machine learning.

This boundary is determined by considering only a subset of the training data, known as support vectors, which are the closest points to the decision boundary. The goal is to create a model that not only fits the training data well but also generalizes effectively to unseen data, thus minimizing the risk of overfitting.\n\nFor datasets that are not linearly separable, SVMs utilize something called the \"kernel trick.\" This technique allows SVMs to transform the original input space into a higher-dimensional space where a non-linear relationship can be represented as a linear one. Common kernels include the polynomial kernel, radial basis function (RBF) kernel, and sigmoid kernel.\n\nWhile SVMs are primarily used for classification, they can also be adapted for regression tasks through a variant known as Support Vector Regression (SVR).\n\nAdditionally, SVM concepts have been extended to unsupervised learning scenarios through Support Vector Clustering (SVC), which leverages the principles of SVMs to identify natural groupings in unlabeled data without prior classification information.\n\nOverall, SVMs are celebrated for their ability to handle both linear and non-linear problems effectively, making them a versatile tool in the field of machine learning.", "input_size": 407, "output_sizes": [490, 571, 575, 581, 499, 543, 466, 562, 557, 322], "output_mean": 516.6, "output_std": 75.07, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 492.25, "p50": 550.0, "p75": 568.75, "p99": 580.46}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "closed_qa", "gen_time": 28.2378}, {"sample_id": "9c97a5a63a3b5fcc", "prompt_id": "a07b519d574216e2", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Does spark provide date & time when a particular event is received in the structured streaming?", "longest_response": "Yes, Apache Spark Structured Streaming provides mechanisms to track when events are processed, but it does not directly provide the timestamp when a particular event was received.

The concept of event time means that each record is associated with a timestamp that reflects when the event occurred.\n\n3. **Processing Time vs. Event Time:**\n   - **Processing Time:** This refers to the time at which the data is processed by the system.\n   - **Event Time:** This is the actual time when the event occurred as recorded in the data itself.\n   \n4. **Watermark:** To deal with out-of-order events or late data, you can set a watermark on event time. This helps in defining how long the system should wait for late data before considering the information complete and emitting results.\n\n5. **Appending System Time:** If the incoming data does not contain a timestamp, you can append the system time (processing time) to each event during the transformation phase using `current_timestamp()` or similar functions.\n\nHere's an example of how you might read data with a timestamp and perform some operations:\n\n```scala\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\n\nval spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"TimestampExample\").getOrCreate()\n\n// Read from a Kafka topic\nval df = spark.readStream\n  .format(\"kafka\")\n  .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", \"host1:port1,host2:port2\")\n  .option(\"subscribe\", \"topicName\")\n  .load()\n\n// Convert the value column to string and parse it as JSON (assuming JSON format)\nval valueDF = df.selectExpr(\"CAST(value AS STRING)\").as[String]\n\n// Parse the JSON string into a DataFrame\nval parsedDF = spark.read.json(valueDF)\n\n// Add a processing time watermark\nval withWatermarkDF = parsedDF.withWatermark(\"timestampColumn\", \"10 minutes\")\n\n// Perform aggregations or other operations based on event time\nval query = withWatermarkDF.groupBy(window($\"timestampColumn\", \"1 minute\"), $\"key\")\n  .count()\n  .writeStream\n  .outputMode(\"complete\")\n  .format(\"console\")\n  .start()\n\nquery.awaitTermination()\n```\n\nIn this example, `timestampColumn` should be replaced with the actual name of the column in your dataset that contains the event timestamp.

This means it generates more heat when carrying the same amount of current. Over time, this increased heat can cause the wire to expand and contract, potentially leading to loose connections.\n\n2. **Loose Connections**: As mentioned above, the expansion and contraction of aluminum wire due to heating and cooling cycles can lead to loose connections. Loose connections are one of the main hazards because they can increase resistance and generate more heat, which could eventually lead to a fire.\n\n3. **Corrosion and Oxidation**: Aluminum wire is more prone to corrosion and oxidation than copper wire. When aluminum oxidizes, the oxide layer can interfere with the flow of electricity, increasing resistance and generating heat. In severe cases, the oxide layer can become brittle and flaky, further weakening the connection.\n\n4. **Different Expansion Rates**: Aluminum and the metals used in electrical devices (like screws and terminals) have different rates of thermal expansion. This difference can cause the wire to loosen over time, especially if it\u2019s not properly secured or if there's excessive vibration or movement in the installation.\n\n5. **Not Suitable for All Devices**: Many modern electrical devices and outlets are designed specifically for copper wiring. Using aluminum wiring in these devices can result in poor connections, which may not meet safety standards and can pose a fire risk.\n\nGiven these risks, it's often recommended that homeowners with aluminum wiring upgrade to copper or copper-clad aluminum wiring, particularly in circuits that carry high loads or where safety is critical, such as those serving kitchen appliances or bathroom fixtures. If you suspect your home has aluminum wiring, it's advisable to consult with a licensed electrician to assess the situation and discuss potential solutions.", "shortest_response": "Aluminum wiring in homes can be dangerous for several reasons:\n\n1. **Loose Connections**: Aluminum wire tends to expand and contract more than copper wire when it heats up and cools down. This movement can cause connections to become loose over time, leading to arcing and sparking which can ignite fires.\n\n2. **Corrosion**: When aluminum comes into contact with certain materials, it can corrode, especially where it connects to devices made of different metals (like copper or brass). Corrosion increases electrical resistance, which can lead to overheating and fire hazards.\n\n3. **Not Suitable for All Devices**: Many electrical devices and outlets are designed for copper wire. Using aluminum wire with these devices can result in poor connections and increased risk of failure.\n\n4. **Handling and Installation Challenges**: Aluminum wire requires special techniques and tools for installation and maintenance compared to copper wire.

Here are some key advantages:\n\n1. **Increased Crop Yield**: GM crops can be engineered to have higher yields due to traits like resistance to pests and diseases, which can reduce crop losses. This is particularly important as global populations continue to grow.\n\n2. **Pest Resistance**: Crops can be genetically modified to produce their own pesticides or to resist certain pests, reducing the need for chemical pesticides. This not only decreases the amount of chemicals used in farming but also reduces the risk of pesticide exposure to farmers and consumers.\n\n3. **Herbicide Tolerance**: Some GM crops are designed to withstand herbicides, allowing farmers to control weeds more effectively without damaging the crops. This can simplify weed management and potentially lead to reduced tillage, which can help prevent soil erosion.\n\n4. **Disease Resistance**: By introducing genes from other organisms, crops can be made resistant to specific plant diseases, reducing the need for fungicides and other treatments. This can improve crop health and increase productivity.\n\n5. **Enhanced Nutritional Content**: Genetic modification can enhance the nutritional value of crops. For example, golden rice has been developed with enhanced beta-carotene content, which the body converts into vitamin A, addressing vitamin deficiencies in many developing countries.\n\n6. **Adaptation to Environmental Stress**: GM technology can help crops adapt to adverse conditions such as drought, high salinity, or extreme temperatures. This resilience can be crucial in regions where climate change is affecting agricultural practices.\n\n7. **Economic Benefits**: The use of GM crops can lower production costs for farmers through reduced input needs (like pesticides and fertilizers), decreased labor requirements, and increased yields. This can lead to higher profits and improved livelihoods for farmers.\n\n8. **Sustainability**: By improving efficiency and reducing the need for harmful chemicals, GM crops can contribute to sustainable farming practices that are less damaging to the environment and preserve natural resources for future generations.\n\nWhile these benefits highlight the potential advantages of GM crops, it's important to note that there are also concerns and debates surrounding their safety, ecological impacts, and ethical considerations.

Here's an overview of some key distinctions:\n\n1. **Funding**: Public schools receive their primary funding from local, state, and federal government sources. This means that the cost of education at public schools is typically subsidized by taxpayers. In contrast, private schools rely on tuition fees paid by students' families, endowments, donations, and sometimes grants. As a result, private school tuition can be quite expensive.\n\n2. **Governance and Management**: Public schools are governed by local or state boards of education and are subject to various regulations and standards set by these governing bodies. Private schools have more autonomy in terms of management and decision-making, often being run by independent boards or religious organizations. They can choose their own educational philosophies and curricula, provided they meet certain accreditation requirements.\n\n3. **Admission Policies**: Public schools are required to accept all students who live within their designated attendance zones, adhering to laws against discrimination based on race, religion, national origin, disability, and gender. Private schools, however, can set their own admission criteria, which might include academic performance, interviews, essays, or standardized test scores. Some private schools may also give preference to students from particular backgrounds (e.g., religious affiliation).\n\n4. **Curriculum and Teaching Methods**: While public schools must follow state-mandated curricula and adhere to specific educational standards, private schools have the flexibility to design their own curricula and teaching methods. This can range from traditional approaches to more progressive or specialized educational models, such as Montessori, Waldorf, or STEM-focused programs.\n\n5. **Student Body Diversity**: Public schools generally reflect the demographic diversity of their surrounding communities, including socioeconomic, racial, and cultural diversity. Private schools often attract students from more affluent families and may have a higher concentration of students from similar backgrounds, though this can vary widely depending on the specific school.\n\n6. **Class Size and Resources**: Due to varying levels of funding and resources, class sizes can differ significantly. Public schools may have larger class sizes compared to private schools, which often invest more in smaller class sizes and additional resources like technology, extracurricular activities, and facilities.\n\n7. **Teacher Qualifications and Compensation**: Teachers in both types of schools are usually required to meet certification standards, but private schools may have additional qualifications or preferences for hiring teachers with advanced degrees or specialized training. Additionally, teacher compensation can vary; while public school teachers typically receive salaries set by union contracts or state guidelines, private school teachers may earn salaries based on institutional policies and funding availability.\n\nEach type of school has its own strengths and challenges, and the best choice depends on individual circumstances, priorities, and goals for education.", "shortest_response": "The differences between public and private schools can be significant and vary by country, but generally speaking, there are several key distinctions:\n\n1. **Funding**: Public schools are typically funded by government taxes, while private schools rely on tuition fees paid by students or their families, endowments, donations, and sometimes government grants.\n\n2. **Accessibility**: Public schools are generally required to accept all students within their designated geographic area, unless they have specific enrollment criteria (like magnet schools). Private schools can choose whom to admit based on academic performance, interviews, essays, or other factors.\n\n3. **Curriculum**: Public schools must follow state or national curriculum guidelines and standards. Private schools have more freedom in designing their own curriculum, which might include religious education or specialized subjects not covered in public schools.\n\n4. **Class Size**: Class sizes in private schools are often smaller than those in public schools due to lower student-to-teacher ratios that can be achieved with higher tuition fees.\n\n5. **Discipline Policies**: Discipline policies in private schools can be stricter and more consistent because they do not have to adhere to the same regulations as public schools.\n\n6. **Extracurricular Activities**: Both types of schools offer extracurricular activities, but private schools may have a wider variety or more resources dedicated to these activities due to their funding model.\n\n7. **Teacher Qualifications**: While both types of schools require teachers to meet certain qualifications, private schools may have more flexibility in hiring practices and might attract teachers with different backgrounds or specialties.\n\n8. **Religious Affiliation**: Many private schools are affiliated with a particular religion and incorporate religious teachings into their curriculum, whereas public schools in most countries must remain secular and cannot promote any specific religion.\n\nThese points provide a general overview, but the specifics can differ widely depending on the region and individual institutions.", "input_size": 39, "output_sizes": [441, 430, 478, 452, 554, 532, 371, 568, 416, 574], "output_mean": 481.6, "output_std": 67.47, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 432.75, "p50": 465.0, "p75": 548.5, "p99": 573.46}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 22.91869}, {"sample_id": "c5120909d675f81f", "prompt_id": "47bd8f1f810fc36d", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Who is Barack Obama?\nContext: Barack Hussein Obama II (/b\u0259\u02c8r\u0251\u02d0k hu\u02d0\u02c8se\u026an o\u028a\u02c8b\u0251\u02d0m\u0259/ (listen) b\u0259-RAHK hoo-SAYN oh-BAH-m\u0259; born August 4, 1961) is an American former politician who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017.

They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.\n\nRadiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in 1993. Their debut single, \"Creep\", became a worldwide hit. Radiohead's popularity and critical standing rose with the release of The Bends in 1995. Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music.\n\nRadiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though Kid A divided listeners, it was later named the best album of the decade by multiple outlets. It was followed by Amnesiac (2001), recorded in the same sessions. Hail to the Thief (2003), with lyrics addressing the War on Terror, blended the band's rock and electronic sides, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI.\n\nRadiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway, and O'Brien have released solo albums; in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.\n\nBy 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart: \"Creep\" (1992), \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" (1996), \"Paranoid Android\" (1997), \"Karma Police\" (1997), \"No Surprises\" (1998), \"Pyramid Song\" (2001), and \"There There\" (2003). \"Creep\" and \"Nude\" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Rolling Stone named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and Rolling Stone readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s.

Developed by Barry W. Boehm, it provides a structured approach based on empirical data from previous projects.\n\n### COCOMO Models:\nCOCOMO has evolved over time, with two main versions being COCOMO I (initially released as COCOMO 81) and COCOMO II.\n\n1. **COCOMO I**: This was the original version that introduced a three-level hierarchy of models\u2014Basic, Intermediate, and Detailed\u2014that offer varying levels of detail and accuracy depending on the available project information.\n   \n2. **COCOMO II**: An enhanced version that includes additional factors to account for modern software development practices and environments. It supports three sub-models:\n   - **Legacy Mode**: For traditional software development projects.\n   - **Early Design Mode**: For projects where requirements and design are still evolving.\n   - **Applications Generators Mode**: For projects using application generators or rapid application development tools.\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Empirical Basis**: COCOMO uses historical data from actual software projects to derive its estimation formulas.\n- **Modular Approach**: The model breaks down the estimation process into smaller, more manageable parts, allowing for adjustments based on specific project characteristics.\n- **Flexibility**: COCOMO can be adapted to different types of projects and organizational contexts by adjusting various parameters.\n\n### Estimation Process:\nThe estimation process typically involves determining the size of the software project (usually measured in KLOC\u2014thousands of lines of code) and then applying a series of multipliers to adjust for various factors such as technology, experience, and project complexity.\n\nFor example, in COCOMO II, the effort estimation equation might look like this:\n\n\\[ E = a \\times (KLOC)^b \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(E\\) is the effort required in person-months.\n- \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are coefficients that depend on the type of project and other factors.\n- \\(KLOC\\) is the estimated size of the software in thousands of lines of code.\n\nEach coefficient (\\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) can vary based on a set of adjustment factors that reflect aspects such as hardware constraints, programming language, and project environment.\n\n### Conclusion:\nCOCOMO is a valuable tool for software project managers and estimators, providing a systematic way to predict costs and timelines based on empirical evidence and project-specific variables.

It is an example of cannibalization.\nThe term alludes to the Osborne Computer Corporation, whose second product did not become available until more than a year after it was announced. The company's subsequent bankruptcy was widely blamed on reduced sales after the announcement.\nThe Osborne Effect states that prematurely discussing future, unavailable products damages sales of existing products. The name comes from the planned replacement of the Osborne 1, an early personal computer first sold by the Osborne Computer Corporation in 1981. In 1983, founder Adam Osborne pre-announced several next-generation computer models (the Osborne Executive and Osborne Vixen), which were only prototypes, highlighting the fact that they would outperform the existing model as the prototypes dramatically cut down assembly time. A widely held belief was that sales of the Osborne 1 fell sharply as customers anticipated those more advanced systems, leading to a sales decline from which Osborne Computer was unable to recover. This belief appeared in the media almost immediately after the company's September 1983 bankruptcy:\n\nTo give the jazzy $2,495 Osborne Executive a running start, Adam began orchestrating publicity early in 1983. We, along with many other magazines, were shown the machine in locked hotel rooms. We were required not to have anything in print about it until the planned release date in mid-April. As far as we know, nothing did appear in print, but dealers heard about the plans and cancelled orders for the Osborne 1 in droves. In early April, Osborne told dealers he would be showing them the machine on a one-week tour the week of 17 April, and emphasized that the new machine was not a competitor for the Osborne 1. But dealers didn't react the way Osborne expected; said Osborne, \"All of them just cancelled their orders for the Osborne 1.\"\n\nOsborne reacted by drastically cutting prices on the Osborne 1 in an effort to stimulate cash flow. But nothing seemed to work, and for several months sales were practically non-existent.\n\nPre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, with the revenue drop for the current product being offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available. However, when the Osborne effect occurs, the quantity of unsold goods increases and the company must react by discounting and/or lowering production of the current product, both of which depress cash flow.", "longest_response": "From the passage provided, the price of the Osborne 1 is mentioned as $2,495, although it's important to note that this price is referenced in the context of the Osborne Executive's price (\"We, along with many other magazines, were shown the machine in locked hotel rooms.

Here's a breakdown of what contributes to a Squishmallow's resell value:\n\n1. **Rarity**: Limited edition or exclusive Squishmallows are more likely to be resold at higher prices due to their scarcity. For example, Jack the Black Cat is considered one of the rarest Squishmallows because it was only available for a short time and sold out quickly.\n\n2. **Condition**: Like any collectible item, the condition of the Squishmallow plays a crucial role in its resell value. Items that are pristine and have not been used or damaged will generally fetch higher prices than those that show signs of wear or use.\n\n3. **Desirability**: Certain characters or designs may be more sought after than others due to personal preferences, marketing campaigns, or their appearance in media. Popular Squishmallows like Connor the Cow, Malcolm the Mushroom, Archie the Axolotl, and Philippe the Frog are examples of characters that might have higher resale values simply because they are favorites among fans.\n\n4. **Market Demand**: The overall demand for Squishmallows in the secondary market can also influence resale prices. If there is a high demand for a particular Squishmallow but limited supply, its value may increase significantly.\n\n5. **Brand Popularity**: As the Squishmallow brand continues to grow in popularity, individual items become more valuable, especially if they are associated with special events, collaborations, or have unique features that set them apart from standard releases.\n\nIt's important to note that while reselling Squishmallows can be profitable, it's also a contentious issue within the collecting community. Some fans feel that reselling inflates prices beyond reasonable levels and can make these toys inaccessible to those who want them for sentimental or collection purposes rather than financial gain.

Characters like Connor the Cow, Malcolm the Mushroom, Archie the Axolotl, and Philippe the Frog have gained significant popularity among collectors.\n\n2. **Rarity**: Limited edition Squishmallows or those with production runs that were very small become highly valuable because they are not easily found. For example, Jack the Black Cat, with its distinctive features and quick sell-out during its initial release, has become extremely rare and thus highly valued by collectors and resellers.\n\n3. **Condition**: The physical state of the Squishmallow also plays a crucial role.

Here's how it works and why it's effective:\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Choose an Initial Guess**: Start with any positive number \\(x_0\\) as your initial guess for the square root of a given number \\(N\\).\n\n2. **Iterate Using the Formula**: For each iteration \\(n\\), update your guess using the formula:\n   \\[\n   x_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(x_n + \\frac{N}{x_n}\\right)\n   \\]\n   This formula essentially takes the average of your current guess \\(x_n\\) and \\(N/x_n\\).\n\n3. **Repeat Until Convergence**: Continue this process until the difference between successive guesses is smaller than some predetermined tolerance level, indicating that you've reached an approximation accurate enough for your needs.\n\n### Why It Works\n\nThe effectiveness of this method can be understood through the following points:\n\n- **Geometric Interpretation**: Consider a rectangle with one side of length \\(x\\) and the other side of length \\(N/x\\). The area of this rectangle is \\(N\\). If \\(x\\) were exactly equal to the square root of \\(N\\), then both sides would be equal, and the rectangle would be a square. By averaging \\(x\\) and \\(N/x\\), you're essentially trying to make these two lengths more equal, which brings you closer to the square root.\n\n- **Mathematical Derivation**: Let's look at what happens when you apply the formula iteratively. Suppose you have an approximation \\(x_n\\) to \\(\\sqrt{N}\\). Then, the next approximation \\(x_{n+1}\\) is defined as:\n  \\[\n  x_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(x_n + \\frac{N}{x_n}\\right)\n  \\]\n\n  To see why this converges to \\(\\sqrt{N}\\), consider the error term \\(e_n = x_n - \\sqrt{N}\\). If \\(x_n\\) is close to \\(\\sqrt{N}\\), then \\(e_n\\) is small. We can analyze the behavior of the error in the next iteration:\n  \\[\n  e_{n+1} = x_{n+1} - \\sqrt{N} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(x_n + \\frac{N}{x_n}\\right) - \\sqrt{N}\n  \\]\n\n  Simplifying this expression:\n  \\[\n  e_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(x_n + \\frac{N}{x_n} - 2\\sqrt{N}\\right)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  e_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left(x_n - \\sqrt{N}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{N}{x_n} - \\sqrt{N}\\right)\\right)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  e_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(e_n + \\frac{N - x_n\\sqrt{N}}{x_n}\\right)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  e_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(e_n - \\frac{e_n^2}{x_n + \\sqrt{N}}\\right)\n  \\]\n\n  Since \\(x_n\\) is close to \\(\\sqrt{N}\\), the denominator \\(x_n + \\sqrt{N}\\) is approximately \\(2\\sqrt{N}\\), so:\n  \\[\n  e_{n+1} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\left(e_n - \\frac{e_n^2}{2\\sqrt{N}}\\right)\n  \\]\n\n  As \\(e_n\\) gets smaller, the term \\(\\frac{e_n^2}{2\\sqrt{N}}\\) becomes negligible compared to \\(e_n\\), leading to a reduction in the error in each iteration. This shows that the error decreases quadratically, meaning the method converges very quickly to the true value of \\(\\sqrt{N}\\).\n\nIn summary, the divide and average method works because it effectively narrows down the gap between the current estimate and the actual square root through successive averaging, leveraging the properties of arithmetic and geometric means to ensure rapid convergence.", "shortest_response": "The divide and average method, also known as the Babylonian method or Heron's method, is an iterative algorithm used to find successively better approximations to the square roots of a number. Here\u2019s how it works and why it's effective:\n\n### The Method\n\nGiven a positive number \\(a\\), we want to find \\(\\sqrt{a}\\). We start with an initial guess \\(x_0\\) for \\(\\sqrt{a}\\). Then we use the following iterative formula:\n\n\\[ x_{n+1} = \\frac{x_n + \\frac{a}{x_n}}{2} \\]\n\nwhere \\(x_n\\) is the \\(n\\)th approximation to \\(\\sqrt{a}\\).\n\n### Why It Works\n\nThe method relies on the idea that if \\(x_n\\) is our current approximation to \\(\\sqrt{a}\\), then \\(\\frac{a}{x_n}\\) is another related value (specifically, it\u2019s the reciprocal of the square root when \\(x_n\\) is the exact square root). By averaging these two values, we get a new estimate that tends to be closer to the actual square root.\n\n#### Mathematical Insight\n\nConsider the function \\(f(x) = x^2 - a\\). Our goal is to find the root of this function, i.e., the value \\(x\\) such that \\(x^2 = a\\). The derivative of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(f'(x) = 2x\\).\n\nIf \\(x_n\\) is our current approximation, then the tangent line to \\(f(x)\\) at \\(x_n\\) has the equation:\n\n\\[ y - f(x_n) = f'(x_n)(x - x_n) \\]\n\nSetting \\(y = 0\\) to find where the tangent intersects the x-axis gives us the next approximation:\n\n\\[ 0 - (x_n^2 - a) = 2x_n(x - x_n) \\]\n\\[ x_n^2 - a = 2x_n(x - x_n) \\]\n\\[ x = x_n - \\frac{x_n^2 - a}{2x_n} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{x_n + \\frac{a}{x_n}}{2} \\]\n\nThis is exactly the formula for the next iteration in the divide and average method.\n\n#### Convergence\n\nThe method converges quadratically, meaning that the number of correct digits roughly doubles with each step once the approximation is reasonably close to the true root. This rapid convergence makes the method very efficient for practical purposes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe divide and average method is a powerful tool for finding square roots because it leverages the geometric mean and arithmetic mean properties of numbers, ensuring that each iteration brings us closer to the true square root with increasing accuracy.", "input_size": 42, "output_sizes": [779, 933, 670, 758, 785, 568, 749, 690, 703, 883], "output_mean": 751.8, "output_std": 99.3, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 693.25, "p50": 753.5, "p75": 783.5, "p99": 928.5}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 41.0144}, {"sample_id": "423ea9c4964c732f", "prompt_id": "3c03855fd21f1cec", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What are 6 different reasons to go on vacation?", "longest_response": "Going on vacation can serve many purposes and offer various benefits.

The goal of process mining is to turn event data into insights and actions. Process mining is an integral part of data science, fueled by the availability of event data and the desire to improve processes.Process mining techniques use event data to show what people, machines, and organizations are really doing. Process mining provides novel insights that can be used to identify the executional path taken by operational processes and address their performance and compliance problems.\n\nProcess mining starts from event data. Input for process mining is an event log. An event log views a process from a particular angle. Each event in the log should contain (1) a unique identifier for a particular process instance (called case id), (2) an activity (description of the event that is occurring), and (3) a timestamp. There may be additional event attributes referring to resources, costs, etc., but these are optional. With some effort, such data can be extracted from any information system supporting operational processes. Process mining uses these event data to answer a variety of process-related questions.", "longest_response": "Process mining is indeed a powerful technique that bridges the gap between data science and process management. It leverages event logs\u2014records of activities performed within an organization\u2014to analyze, understand, and improve business processes. This method allows organizations to visualize and analyze the actual flow of work rather than relying solely on theoretical models or assumptions about how processes should operate.\n\nThe core idea behind process mining is to extract valuable insights from the vast amounts of data generated during the operation of business processes. These insights can then be used to optimize and streamline operations, enhance compliance, and drive overall performance improvements.\n\nHere's a breakdown of key components and aspects of process mining:\n\n1. **Event Logs**: The foundation of process mining is an event log, which is essentially a detailed record of events that occur during the execution of a process. Each event in the log typically includes:\n   - A unique identifier for each process instance (case ID).\n   - The specific activity or task being executed.\n   - A timestamp indicating when the activity occurred.\n   - Optionally, other attributes like resource involved, cost, duration, etc.\n\n2. **Techniques Used**:\n   - **Conformance Checking**: Evaluates whether the observed process execution conforms to a predefined model. This helps in identifying deviations from expected behavior.\n   - **Process Discovery**: Automatically generates a process model based on the event log data. This can reveal the actual process flow as opposed to the idealized version.\n   - **Variants Analysis**: Identifies different ways a process can be executed (variants) and their frequency, helping to understand process variability.\n   - **Performance Analysis**: Analyzes the efficiency and effectiveness of the process by looking at metrics like cycle time, throughput, and resource utilization.\n\n3. **Applications**:\n   - **Process Optimization**: Identifying bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement.\n   - **Compliance Monitoring**: Ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements and internal policies.\n   - **Operational Insights**: Gaining deep understanding of how processes actually function, which can lead to better decision-making.\n\n4. **Benefits**:\n   - Provides actionable insights derived from real-world data.\n   - Facilitates continuous improvement by enabling regular analysis of process performance.\n   - Enhances transparency and accountability within organizational processes.\n\nIn summary, process mining transforms raw event data into meaningful information that can significantly impact business outcomes.

Here are several methods and metrics you can use to assess the effectiveness of your marketing spend:\n\n1. **Return on Investment (ROI):** This is one of the most straightforward ways to measure performance. ROI is calculated as (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) * 100. For marketing, you would replace \"Net Profit\" with the additional revenue generated from the marketing campaign minus the cost of the campaign itself.\n\n2. **Cost Per Acquisition (CPA):** This metric measures how much it costs to acquire a new customer through marketing efforts. CPA = Total Marketing Spend / Number of New Customers Acquired.\n\n3. **Conversion Rate:** This measures the percentage of visitors who take a desired action, such as making a purchase or filling out a form. Conversion Rate = (Total Conversions / Total Visits) * 100.\n\n4. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Understanding the total value a customer brings over their lifetime can help you determine if the initial marketing spend was justified in the long run.\n\n5. **Attribution Modeling:** This helps understand which touchpoints in the customer journey are most effective at converting prospects into customers. Common models include first-touch, last-touch, linear, time-decay, etc.\n\n6. **Website Analytics:** Tools like Google Analytics provide detailed insights into visitor behavior, including bounce rates, time spent on site, pages per session, and more. These can give clues about the effectiveness of your website and its impact on conversions.\n\n7. **Social Media Metrics:** Engagement rates, follower growth, click-through rates (CTR), and conversion rates specific to social media platforms can help gauge the performance of your social media marketing efforts.\n\n8. **Email Open Rates and Click-Through Rates:** These metrics can indicate how well your email campaigns are performing and whether they are driving traffic back to your website.\n\n9. **Lead Generation:** Track the number of leads generated from each marketing channel and follow up to see how many convert into sales. This can help you understand which channels are most effective for generating qualified leads.\n\n10. **Brand Awareness Surveys:** Sometimes, the impact of marketing isn't immediately quantifiable in terms of direct sales. Conducting surveys to gauge brand awareness, sentiment, and recognition can provide valuable insights into the broader impact of your marketing efforts.\n\nTo effectively evaluate these metrics, consider using a combination of tools such as analytics software, CRM systems, and marketing automation platforms.

Models like first-touch, last-touch, linear, time decay, and data-driven attribution can provide insights into which channels and campaigns are most effective.\n\n3. **Analyze ROI:** Calculate the return on investment by comparing the revenue generated from your marketing activities to the cost of those activities. This helps you understand the direct financial impact of your marketing spend.\n\n4. **Conduct A/B Testing:** Test different versions of your marketing materials or strategies to see which performs better. This can help you optimize future campaigns based on proven success.\n\n5. **Leverage Analytics Tools:** Use tools like Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, or other specialized platforms to gather and analyze data about user behavior, traffic sources, conversion rates, and more.\n\n6. **Customer Feedback:** Collect feedback directly from customers to understand their experiences with your marketing efforts. Surveys, interviews, and social media listening can provide qualitative insights that quantitative metrics might miss.\n\n7. **Regular Reporting:** Set up regular reporting cycles to review the performance of your marketing activities. This allows you to make timely adjustments and improvements.\n\n8. **Benchmarking:** Compare your results against industry standards or competitors to gauge your performance relative to others in your market.\n\n9. **Multichannel Analysis:** Evaluate how well your various marketing channels (email, social media, SEO, PPC, etc.) are performing individually and collectively.\n\n10. **Lifetime Value (LTV) Considerations:** Consider not just immediate returns but also the long-term value of customers acquired through marketing efforts.

Avoid processed foods, sugars, and excessive carbohydrates. Drinking plenty of water can also help you feel full and reduce your overall calorie intake.\n\n3. **Regular Exercise**: Incorporate both cardiovascular exercises (such as running, cycling, or swimming) and strength training into your routine. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week.\n\n4. **Portion Control**: Be mindful of portion sizes.

As the largest optical telescope in space, it is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars, the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.\n\nThe U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led JWST's design and development and partnered with two main agencies: the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Maryland managed telescope development, while the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore on the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University currently operates JWST. The primary contractor for the project was Northrop Grumman. The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana, and arrived at the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point in January 2022. The first JWST image was released to the public via a press conference on 11 July 2022.\n\nJWST's primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated beryllium, which combined create a 6.5-meter-diameter (21 ft) mirror, compared with Hubble's 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). This gives JWST a light-collecting area of about 25 square meters, about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet and visible (0.1 to 0.8 \u03bcm), and near infrared (0.8\u20132.5 \u03bcm) spectra, JWST observes a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light (red) through mid-infrared (0.6\u201328.3 \u03bcm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below 50 K (\u2212223 \u00b0C; \u2212370 \u00b0F), such that the infrared light emitted by the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. It is deployed in a solar orbit near the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point, about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 mi) from Earth, where its five-layer sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\n\nInitial designs for the telescope, then named the Next Generation Space Telescope, began in 1996. Two concept studies were commissioned in 1999, for a potential launch in 2007 and a US$1 billion budget. The program was plagued with enormous cost overruns and delays; a major redesign in 2005 led to the current approach, with construction completed in 2016 at a total cost of US$10 billion. The high-stakes nature of the launch and the telescope's complexity were remarked upon by the media, scientists, and engineers.", "longest_response": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a state-of-the-art space observatory designed primarily for infrared astronomy, marking a significant advancement in space exploration technology. As the largest optical telescope ever sent into space, it boasts a primary mirror composed of 18 hexagonal segments made of gold-coated beryllium, collectively forming a 6.5-meter-wide mirror, which is considerably larger than the Hubble Space Telescope's mirror. This enhanced size allows the JWST to capture more light, making it particularly adept at observing distant, ancient, or faint cosmic phenomena that previous telescopes couldn't detect.\n\nLaunched on December 25, 2021, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana, the JWST reached its operational orbit at the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrange point in January 2022. Its mission involves studying the universe's earliest stars and galaxies, understanding galaxy evolution, probing the atmospheres of exoplanets, and much more. To achieve this, the telescope is equipped with highly sensitive instruments capable of detecting light in the infrared spectrum, ranging from long-wavelength visible light to mid-infrared wavelengths.\n\nMaintaining extremely low temperatures is crucial for the telescope's operation to prevent any self-emitted infrared radiation from interfering with its observations. Therefore, it is positioned far from Earth's heat sources and shielded by a five-layer sunshield. The telescope's operational location at the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrange point, approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, ensures optimal conditions for its sensitive instruments.\n\nDeveloped under the leadership of NASA, with contributions from the European and Canadian space agencies, the JWST represents a collaborative effort spanning decades, overcoming numerous technical and financial challenges.

The key difference lies in the fact that the grape skins, seeds, and sometimes stems are left in contact with the juice during fermentation, which can last from days to months. This extended maceration gives the wine its distinctive color, ranging from pale gold to deep amber, and imparts additional flavors and tannins.\n\nThe term \"orange wine\" specifically refers to this particular method of production rather than the color of the final product, which can vary widely.

Espresso machines come in manual and automatic versions.\n\n5. **AeroPress**: Combines elements of French press and pour-over brewing. Ground coffee is placed in a cylinder, hot water is added, and then the plunger is used to apply pressure, forcing the coffee through a microfilter.\n\n6. **Moka Pot**: Also known as a stovetop espresso maker, it uses steam pressure to push boiling water up through ground coffee, creating a strong brew similar to espresso.\n\n7. **Cold Brew**: Coffee grounds are steeped in cold water for an extended period (usually 12-24 hours), resulting in a smooth, less acidic coffee concentrate that can be served cold or diluted with hot water.\n\n8. **Siphon (Vacuum Pot)**: A two-chamber glass apparatus where water is heated in the lower chamber, creating vapor pressure that forces water up into the upper chamber with coffee grounds. When the heat source is removed, the pressure drops, causing the coffee to siphon back into the bottom chamber.\n\n9. **Turkish/Ibrik Brewing**: Finely ground coffee is boiled in a small pot called an ibrik or cezve with water and sometimes sugar, creating a very strong and thick coffee.\n\n10. **Chemex**: Similar to pour-over but uses a thicker paper filter, resulting in a cleaner taste.

Revenue and expense should be kept separate from personal expenses.\nGoing Concern: assumes that the business will be in operation indefinitely. This validates the methods of asset capitalization, depreciation, and amortization. Only when liquidation is certain this assumption is not applicable. The business will continue to exist in the unforeseeable future.\nMonetary Unit principle: assumes a stable currency is going to be the unit of record. The FASB accepts the nominal value of the US Dollar as the monetary unit of record unadjusted for inflation.\nTime-period principle: implies that the economic activities of an enterprise can be divided into artificial time periods.\nPrinciples\nHistorical cost principle: requires companies to account and report assets and liabilities acquisition costs rather than fair market value. This principle provides information that is reliable (removing opportunity to provide subjective and potentially biased market values), but not very relevant. Thus there is a trend to use fair values. Most debts and securities are now reported at market values.\nRevenue recognition principle: holds that companies should record revenue when earned but not when received. The flow of cash does not have any bearing on the recognition of revenue. This is the essence of accrual basis accounting. Conversely, however, losses must be recognized when their occurrence becomes probable, whether or not it has actually occurred. This comports with the constraint of conservatism, yet brings it into conflict with the constraint of consistency, in that reflecting revenues/gains is inconsistent with the way in which losses are reflected.\nMatching principle: expenses have to be matched with revenues as long as it is reasonable to do so. Expenses are recognized not when the work is performed, or when a product is produced, but when the work or the product actually makes its contribution to revenue. Only if no connection with revenue can be established, cost may be charged as expenses to the current period (e.g., office salaries and other administrative expenses). This principle allows greater evaluation of actual profitability and performance (shows how much was spent to earn revenue). Depreciation and Cost of Goods Sold are good examples of application of this principle.\nFull disclosure principle: Amount and kinds of information disclosed should be decided based on trade-off analysis as a larger amount of information costs more to prepare and use. Information disclosed should be enough to make a judgment while keeping costs reasonable. Information is presented in the main body of financial statements, in the notes or as supplementary information\nConstraints\nObjectivity principle: The company financial statements provided by the accountants should be based on objective evidence.\nMateriality principle: The significance of an item should be considered when it is reported. An item is considered significant when it would affect the decision of a reasonable individual.\nConsistency principle: The company uses the same accounting principles and methods from period to period.\nConservatism principle: When choosing between two solutions, the one which has the less favorable outcome is the solution which should be chosen (see convention of conservatism)\nCost Constraint: The benefits of reporting financial information should justify and be greater than the costs imposed on supplying it.", "longest_response": "The four basic principles of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are designed to ensure consistency, reliability, and comparability in financial reporting. Here's a summary of these principles:\n\n1. **Historical Cost Principle**: This principle mandates that assets and liabilities should be recorded at their original acquisition cost rather than their current market value. This ensures that the financial statements reflect objective and verifiable data, although it may not always represent the most up-to-date value of the items.\n\n2. **Revenue Recognition Principle**: According to this principle, revenue should be recognized when it is earned, regardless of when the payment is received. This aligns with the concept of accrual accounting, which aims to match revenues with the expenses incurred in earning them. It helps in providing a clearer picture of a company\u2019s operational performance over time.\n\n3. **Matching Principle**: This principle states that expenses should be recognized in the same period as the revenues they help generate. This allows for a better understanding of the profitability of operations by correlating expenses directly with the revenues they contribute to generating.\n\n4. **Full Disclosure Principle**: This principle emphasizes the importance of providing comprehensive and transparent information that is necessary for users to understand the financial health and position of the entity. While aiming for full disclosure, companies also need to balance this with the cost-effectiveness of preparing and disseminating such information.\n\nThese principles collectively aim to ensure that financial reports are accurate, consistent, and useful for making informed decisions.

After six days, raw chicken would definitely not be safe to eat and poses a high risk of bacterial growth leading to foodborne illnesses.\n\n2. **Jar of Olives**: If the olives were in an unopened jar, they are likely to be safe because they are preserved in brine or oil, which acts as a preservative. However, once opened, they should be refrigerated promptly. Leaving them out for six days might start to compromise their safety, but they generally last longer than raw meat. It's safer to discard them rather than risk illness.\n\n3. **Hard Cheese**: Hard cheeses like cheddar or Parmesan can last longer at room temperature compared to softer cheeses. However, after six days, there's a risk of mold growth or spoilage. If you notice any signs of mold, discoloration, or off-odors, it's best to throw it away.\n\n4. **Milk**: Milk spoils very quickly when not refrigerated. It should be discarded immediately if left out for more than two hours, let alone six days. Drinking spoiled milk can cause severe digestive issues and other health problems.\n\n5. **Fruit Jelly**: Jams and jellies are typically shelf-stable due to their high sugar content and low water activity. Unopened jars can be safely stored at room temperature. Once opened, however, they should be kept refrigerated. While it might be tempting to keep it, it's better to err on the side of caution and discard it after being unrefrigerated for six days.\n\nIn summary, the safest option from your list that could potentially be consumed after six days without refrigeration is the jar of olives, provided it was unopened and shows no signs of spoilage.

Drivers also have the lowest loft angle (typically around 8-12 degrees), meaning they produce less backspin and more roll upon landing.\n- **Design:** Modern drivers often feature adjustable weights and adjustable hosels to fine-tune the trajectory and direction of the ball. They are made of materials like titanium or composite carbon fiber to reduce weight and increase distance.\n\n**Putter:**\n- **Purpose:** The putter is used on the green to hit short shots that aim to get the ball into the hole.

For example, it may be a local copy of data located remotely, or may be a subset of the rows and/or columns of a table or join result, or may be a summary using an aggregate function.", "longest_response": "A materialized view in database management systems is a precomputed and stored query result that can significantly enhance performance when accessing large datasets or complex queries. It is essentially a table containing the results of a query that you specify. Unlike ordinary views which do not store any data themselves but rather compute their contents dynamically at runtime based on the underlying tables, materialized views actually store the computed results.\n\nKey characteristics and uses of materialized views include:\n\n1. **Precomputed Data**: The data in a materialized view is generated by running the associated query at the time the materialized view is created or refreshed. This precomputation means that when you access the materialized view, the database does not need to execute the underlying query again, which can save significant processing time.\n\n2. **Storage of Results**: Materialized views store their results in the database, just like regular tables do with their data. This makes them particularly useful for complex queries that involve multiple joins, aggregations, or other operations that might be slow to compute on demand.\n\n3. **Flexibility in Content**: Materialized views can contain a wide range of data, including:\n   - A local copy of data from remote databases.\n   - A subset of rows and/or columns from one or more tables or join results.\n   - Summary data obtained through the use of aggregate functions (like SUM, COUNT, AVG).\n\n4. **Periodic Refresh**: Since the data in a materialized view is precomputed, it can become outdated if the underlying data changes. Therefore, materialized views often have refresh policies that dictate how frequently they should be updated to reflect changes in the source data. These refreshes can be full (where all data is recomputed) or incremental (where only changes are applied).\n\n5. **Optimization for Reporting and Analysis**: Materialized views are especially valuable in environments where there is a need for frequent reporting or complex analysis, such as in data warehousing scenarios. They can help reduce the load on the main database by offloading some of the computational work to these precomputed views.\n\nIn summary, materialized views offer a powerful mechanism for improving performance in database applications by caching the results of expensive queries, thereby reducing the response time for repeated accesses to those results.", "shortest_response": "A materialized view in database management systems (DBMS) is a precomputed and stored query result. It's essentially a database object that captures the outcome of a query and stores this data as if it were a table. This can significantly enhance query performance because instead of executing the query each time it is needed, the DBMS can simply retrieve the precomputed data from the materialized view.\n\nHere are some key points about materialized views:\n\n1. **Precomputation**: The data in a materialized view is generated when the view is created or refreshed, not when it is queried.\n2. **Storage**: Unlike regular views which do not store actual data but rather a SQL statement to generate data on demand, materialized views store the actual data.\n3. **Performance**: By storing the results of complex queries, materialized views can greatly improve the speed of reporting and analytical queries.\n4. **Data Transformation**: They can include transformations like aggregations, joins, and projections, making them useful for generating summaries or reports.\n5. **Refresh Mechanism**: Materialized views need to be refreshed periodically to ensure they reflect the latest data, either fully or incrementally depending on the implementation and requirements.\n\nMaterialized views are particularly useful in data warehousing and business intelligence applications where large volumes of data are analyzed frequently.", "input_size": 98, "output_sizes": [368, 331, 424, 339, 452, 329, 332, 349, 266, 386], "output_mean": 357.6, "output_std": 50.23, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 331.25, "p50": 344.0, "p75": 381.5, "p99": 449.48}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "closed_qa", "gen_time": 18.09079}, {"sample_id": "d6abf1620bf6c796", "prompt_id": "5c53fad7cce6a38a", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Considering Austin is in the central region of Texas, which of these places are in east, west, north and south.

It can also significantly improve muscle recovery following exercise by reducing the levels of blood lactate concentration. For any injury presenting with palpable swelling and heat, and visible redness - such as a strain/sprain - contrast baths are contraindicated during the acute inflammation stage. Acute inflammation begins at the time of injury and lasts for approximately 72 hours.", "longest_response": "Contrast therapy, often referred to as contrast bathing or contrast water therapy, involves alternating between hot and cold water immersion to achieve various therapeutic benefits. This technique is commonly used in sports medicine and physical therapy to enhance recovery and manage certain conditions.\n\nHere are some specific uses of contrast therapy:\n\n1. **Reducing Swelling**: By alternately constricting and dilating blood vessels, contrast therapy can help reduce swelling around injuries. The cold water helps to constrict blood vessels and reduce inflammation, while the hot water promotes vasodilation, which can flush out waste products and bring fresh nutrients and oxygen to the area.\n\n2. **Aiding Recovery from Exercise**: After intense workouts or athletic activities, muscles can become fatigued and sore. Contrast therapy can aid in the recovery process by improving circulation, reducing muscle spasms, and decreasing delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS).\n\n3. **Improving Muscle Recovery**: Contrast therapy can help reduce the levels of blood lactate concentration, a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism that can contribute to muscle fatigue and soreness. By enhancing blood flow, it aids in the removal of this substance more efficiently.\n\n4. **Enhancing Circulation**: Alternating between hot and cold water can stimulate blood flow throughout the body, which may help improve overall circulation and promote healing.\n\nIt's important to note that while contrast therapy can be beneficial, it should not be applied to injuries during the acute inflammation stage (typically the first 72 hours after an injury). During this period, the focus should be on protecting the injured area, reducing swelling, and preventing further damage.

Her genre-spanning discography, songwriting abilities and artistic reinventions have received critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country artist to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.\nSwift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\nExiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021\u2014Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her 2022 album Midnights and single \"Anti-Hero\" broke all-time streaming records. Swift has directed music videos and films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and played supporting roles in others.\nHaving sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians in history. She is the most streamed woman on Spotify and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards; and 92 Guinness World Records. Swift has been featured in rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100.

Isn't it possible that the listener would associate \"pencil\" with \"wood\"? Maybe the listener would associate the word \"pencil\" with \"round\" instead (as pencils are, usually, in fact, round!). Wittgenstein writes regarding several possible \"interpretations\" which may arise after such a lesson. The student may interpret your pointing at a pencil and saying \"pencil\" to mean the following: (1) This is a pencil; (2) This is round; (3) This is wood; (4) This is one; (5) This is hard, etc., etc.", "longest_response": "Ludwig Wittgenstein's critique of ostensive definition highlights the inherent ambiguity and limitations in teaching words through simple pointing or direct demonstration. When someone points to an object, like a pencil, and says \"pencil,\" there is no guarantee that the learner will understand precisely what aspect of the object or situation is being labeled.\n\nWittgenstein argues that ostensive definition can lead to multiple interpretations because:\n\n1. **Ambiguity of Focus**: The learner might not be clear about what feature of the object is being highlighted. Is it the whole pencil, its shape, its material, or some other characteristic? Without further context or explanation, the learner might attach the label to any number of features.\n   \n2. **Lack of Contextual Information**: Learning through ostension alone lacks the broader context necessary for understanding the full range of applications and exceptions for a word. Words often have nuanced meanings and usage scenarios that go beyond a single instance.\n   \n3. **Pre-existing Knowledge and Bias**: The learner's preconceptions and biases can influence their interpretation of what is being demonstrated. If the learner has previously encountered the word in different contexts, these prior experiences might color their understanding of the new ostensive definition.\n\n4. **Infinite Interpretations**: As Wittgenstein suggests, there could be countless ways to interpret the ostensive definition based on the learner's subjective experience and perspective. Each learner might derive a different meaning from the same demonstration.\n\nTo illustrate, imagine a teacher pointing to a pencil and saying \"pencil.\" A learner might think:\n- \"This is a writing tool.\"\n- \"This is made of wood.\"\n- \"This is cylindrical.\"\n- \"This is used in offices.\"\n- \"This is hard.\"\n\nEach of these interpretations could be valid in certain contexts, but they represent different aspects of what we generally consider a \"pencil.\" Wittgenstein's point is that without more detailed guidance and examples, the ostensive method alone cannot ensure that the learner grasps the intended meaning accurately.\n\nIn summary, Wittgenstein's critique of ostensive definition emphasizes the need for a richer, more contextual approach to language learning, highlighting the complexity and flexibility of human language that goes beyond simple pointing and naming exercises.", "shortest_response": "Ludwig Wittgenstein's critique of ostensive definition highlights the inherent ambiguity and potential for misunderstanding that arises when learning words through direct association with objects or actions. In his view, ostensive definition involves pointing to an object and naming it, such as pointing to a pencil and saying \"pencil.\" However, this method of teaching language can lead to significant problems because the learner might not understand precisely what aspect of the demonstration they should focus on.\n\nWittgenstein points out that when someone points to a pencil and says \"pencil,\" the learner might associate the word \"pencil\" with various attributes of the pencil, such as its shape (\"round\"), material (\"wood\"), or even qualities like hardness. Each of these interpretations represents a different way of understanding the word \"pencil,\" and without further context or explanation, the learner cannot be certain which attribute or combination of attributes the speaker intends to convey.\n\nThis critique underscores the complexity of language acquisition and the importance of a broader context beyond simple pointing and naming. It suggests that language learning involves much more than just associating words with objects; it requires understanding the rules and uses of language within a community. Wittgenstein argues that the meaning of a word is found in its use, implying that words gain their meaning through their application in various contexts rather than through isolated acts of ostensive definition.", "input_size": 266, "output_sizes": [290, 355, 314, 360, 272, 332, 286, 283, 344, 450], "output_mean": 328.6, "output_std": 50.47, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 287.0, "p50": 323.0, "p75": 352.25, "p99": 441.9}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "information_extraction", "gen_time": 19.81386}, {"sample_id": "eb122808a0555688", "prompt_id": "2678b784a17d61a6", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Write a letter to your friend expressing your feelings about earning your first wage.", "longest_response": "Dear [Friend's Name],\n\nI hope this letter finds you well and in good spirits.

It's about gaining independence and taking steps towards self-sufficiency.\n\nThis journey hasn't been without its challenges. There were times when I felt overwhelmed and questioned whether it was all worth it.

I am writing to share with you something truly momentous that has happened in my life recently \u2013 I earned my very first wage! It feels like a dream come true, and I can hardly believe the sense of accomplishment and pride that comes with it.\n\nWorking hard over the past few weeks, I've been putting in all the effort I could muster to earn this money. Each day felt like a step closer to achieving something significant, not just for myself but also as a way to contribute to our family. The joy of seeing the paycheck in my hands was overwhelming; it was a tangible reminder of my progress and the potential I hold within me.\n\nWhat makes this achievement even more special is the realization that this is just the beginning. With each dollar I earn, I feel empowered and motivated to set new goals for myself. I'm thinking about saving some of the money for future education or perhaps even starting a small savings fund for a rainy day.\n\nThe experience has taught me valuable lessons about responsibility, perseverance, and the importance of setting financial goals. I am grateful for every moment of hard work and the challenges that came with it because they have shaped me into a stronger person.\n\nI would love to hear from you about any similar experiences you might have had or how you're managing your finances. It always helps to exchange thoughts and learn from one another.\n\nThank you for being there through everything, and I look forward to sharing more adventures and milestones with you in the future.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name]", "input_size": 44, "output_sizes": [394, 372, 409, 383, 464, 469, 414, 320, 385, 461], "output_mean": 407.1, "output_std": 44.82, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 383.5, "p50": 401.5, "p75": 449.25, "p99": 468.55}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "creative_writing", "gen_time": 18.2662}, {"sample_id": "237ee8d2daceeffc", "prompt_id": "28915c50541a3074", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What are the words of House Allyrion?", "longest_response": "It seems there might be some confusion in your query.
