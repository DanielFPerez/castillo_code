However, the most widely accepted and popular system is the \"2/1 Major\" system, which is based on the work of David Warfield and later developed by Mike Lawrence.\n\nThis system is suitable for players with a strong understanding of the basics of bridge and who have practiced extensively with it. Here's a brief overview:\n\n**Key principles:**\n\n1. **Majority of 2/1**: The system is based on the idea of bidding a major suit (hearts or spades) with a 2/1 response, which means that the responder can accept or reject the bid with a 2.\n2. **Forcing hand**: The opener should only bid a major suit if they have a strong hand, such as a major suit ace or king.\n3. **Forcing responder**: The responder should accept the bid if they have a strong hand in the suit bid, and reject it if they don't.\n4. **Forcing the suit**: If the opener bids a major suit and the responder accepts, the opener should then bid the next major suit, forcing the responder to accept or reject.\n\n**Bidding sequence:**\n\n1. **1C**: The opener bids 1 Club to start the bidding, indicating a weak hand.\n2. **1D**: The opener bids 1 Diamond to show a stronger hand, but no major suit.\n3. **1H**: The opener bids 1 Heart to show a major suit, and the responder bids 2 Hearts to accept or reject.\n4. **2C**: The opener bids 2 Clubs to show a weak hand, and the responder bids 2 Diamonds to show a strong hand.\n5. **2D**: The opener bids 2 Diamonds to show a strong hand, but no major suit.\n6. **2H**: The opener bids 2 Hearts to show a major suit, and the responder bids 3 Hearts to accept or reject.\n7. **3C**: The opener bids 3 Clubs to show a weak hand, and the responder bids 3 Diamonds to show a strong hand.\n8. **3D**: The opener bids 3 Diamonds to show a strong hand, but no major suit.\n9. **3H**: The opener bids 3 Hearts to show a major suit, and the responder bids 4 Hearts to accept or reject.\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n1. **Easy to learn**: The 2/1 Major system is relatively simple to learn and understand.\n2. **Flexible**: The system allows for a wide range of bids and responses.\n3. **Balanced**: The system promotes balanced bidding, which is essential for competitive bridge play.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n1. **Requires practice**: The system requires extensive practice to master.\n2. **Limited flexibility**: The system can be inflexible in certain situations, such as when the opener has a weak hand but a strong suit.\n3. **Not suitable for all players**: The system may not be suitable for players with limited experience or those who prefer a more straightforward bidding system.\n\nIn summary, the 2/1 Major system is a popular and effective bidding system for duplicate bridge, but it requires practice and dedication to master.", "shortest_response": "The best bidding system in duplicate bridge is a matter of ongoing debate among bridge players and experts. However, some of the most widely used and respected systems include:\n\n1. **Rubin 2/1**: Developed by Sam A. Rubin, this system is a popular choice among club players. It emphasizes the importance of bidding in the major suits and uses a 2/1 major/minor distribution.\n2. **Strong Clubbing**: This system, developed by David Bird and Eric Greco, is known for its simplicity and flexibility. It encourages players to bid strong hands in major suits and use the minor suits for more speculative bids.\n3. **Acol**: Developed by David A. Acol, this system is a more traditional approach that emphasizes the importance of bidding in the major suits and using the minor suits for more speculative bids.\n4. **The 2/1 Major with a Twist**: This system is similar to Rubin 2/1 but with a few key differences. It places more emphasis on bidding in the minor suits and uses a more nuanced approach to major suits.\n\nIt's worth noting that the best bidding system for you will depend on your individual playing style and experience level. Many experts recommend starting with a simple system and gradually adding more complexity as you become more comfortable with the game.\n\nIt's also important to remember that bidding is just one aspect of the game, and a good bridge player needs to be able to think critically and make strategic decisions at the table.\n\nIn duplicate bridge, the most important thing is to be able to accurately assess your hand and make informed bidding decisions. This requires a combination of knowledge, experience, and practice.\n\nUltimately, the best bidding system is one that you can master and enjoy playing with.", "input_size": 45, "output_sizes": [614, 449, 589, 596, 433, 352, 495, 467, 668, 573], "output_mean": 523.6, "output_std": 93.93, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 453.5, "p50": 534.0, "p75": 594.25, "p99": 663.14}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 11.89517}, {"sample_id": "7c3c0a48741fdb58", "prompt_id": "9bc4261296d6a7da", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What are recommendations for some European cities to visit.", "longest_response": "Europe offers a diverse range of cities, each with its own unique character, history, and culture.

A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by John of Aviz (later King John I of Portugal) and commanded by General Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira defeated the Castilians in the Battle of Aljubarrota. With this battle, the House of Aviz became the ruling house of Portugal.\n\nThe new ruling dynasty would proceed to push Portugal to the limelight of European politics and culture, creating and sponsoring works of literature, like the Cr\u00f3nicas d'el Rei D. Jo\u00e3o I by Fern\u00e3o Lopes, the first riding and hunting manual Livro da ensinan\u00e7a de bem cavalgar toda sela and O Leal Conselheiro both by King Edward of Portugal and the Portuguese translations of Cicero's De Oficiis and Seneca's De Beneficiis by the well traveled Prince Peter of Coimbra, as well as his magnum opus Tratado da Vertuosa Benfeytoria. In an effort of solidification and centralization of royal power the monarchs of this dynasty also ordered the compilation, organization and publication of the first three compilations of laws in Portugal: the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es d'el Rei D. Duarte, which was never enforced; the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Afonsinas, whose application and enforcement was not uniform across the realm; and the Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Manuelinas, which took advantage of the printing press to reach every corner of the kingdom. The Avis Dynasty also sponsored works of architecture like the Mosteiro da Batalha (literally, the Monastery of the Battle) and led to the creation of the manueline style of architecture in the 16th century.\n\nPortugal also spearheaded European exploration of the world and the Age of Discovery. Prince Henry the Navigator, son of King John I of Portugal, became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour. During this period, Portugal explored the Atlantic Ocean, discovering the Atlantic archipelagos the Azores, Madeira, and Cape Verde; explored the African coast; colonized selected areas of Africa; discovered an eastern route to India via the Cape of Good Hope; discovered Brazil, explored the Indian Ocean, established trading routes throughout most of southern Asia; and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to China and Japan.\n\nIn 1415, Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering Ceuta, the first prosperous Islamic trade centre in North Africa. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: Madeira and the Azores, which led to the first colonization movements.\n\nIn 1422, by decree of King John I, Portugal officially abandoned the previous dating system, the Era of Caesar, and adopted the Anno Domini system, therefore becoming the last catholic realm to do so.\n\n\nThroughout the 15th century, Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for several common types of tradable commodities at the time, ranging from gold to slaves, as they looked for a route to India and its spices, which were coveted in Europe.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas, intended to resolve the dispute that had been created following the return of Christopher Columbus, was made by Pope Alexander VI, the mediator between Portugal and Spain. It was signed on 7 June 1494, and divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two countries along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa).\n\n\nIn 1498, Vasco da Gama accomplished what Columbus set out to do and became the first European to reach India by sea, bringing economic prosperity to Portugal and its population of 1.7 million residents, and helping to start the Portuguese Renaissance. In 1500, the Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real reached what is now Canada and founded the town of Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, Newfoundland and Labrador, long before the French and English in the 17th century, and being just one of many Portuguese colonizations of the Americas.\n\nIn 1500, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral discovered Brazil and claimed it for Portugal. Ten years later, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Goa in India, Muscat and Ormuz in the Persian Strait, and Malacca, now a state in Malaysia. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic. Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe, landing in such places as Taiwan, Japan, the island of Timor, and in the Moluccas.\n\nAlthough for a long period it was believed the Dutch were the first Europeans to arrive in Australia, there is also some evidence that the Portuguese may have discovered Australia in 1521. From 1519 to 1522, Ferdinand Magellan (Fern\u00e3o de Magalh\u00e3es) organized a Spanish expedition to the East Indies which resulted in the first circumnavigation of the globe. Magellan never made it back to Europe as he was killed by natives in the Philippines in 1521.\n\nThe Treaty of Zaragoza, signed on 22 April 1529 between Portugal and Spain, specified the anti-meridian to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas.\n\nAll these factors made Portugal one of the world's major economic, military, and political powers from the 15th century until the late 16th century.", "longest_response": "The Treaty of Tordesillas was a treaty signed on June 7, 1494, between Pope Alexander VI, representing the Catholic Church, and the monarchs of Portugal and Spain, King John II of Portugal and King Ferdinand II of Aragon, respectively.

This meridian served as the boundary between the Portuguese and Spanish empires, with the Portuguese controlling the lands west of the line and the Spanish controlling the lands east of it.\n\nThe treaty was significant for several reasons:\n\n1. It established the principle of the \"Treaty of Tordesillas,\" which became a model for future agreements between European powers regarding the division of newly discovered lands.\n2. It gave Portugal control over the vast territories in the Atlantic, including Brazil, the Azores, and Madeira, as well as the eastern coast of Africa.\n3.

It is not mentioned in encyclopedias and dictionaries of the 1970s, first appearing in an Italian dictionary in 1980, and in English in 1982.

The dish was added to its menu in 1972. Accounts by Carminantonio Iannaccone claim the tiramisu sold at Le Beccherie was made by him in his bakery, created on 24 December 1969.\n\nIt has been claimed that tiramisu has aphrodisiac effects and was concocted by a 19th-century Treviso brothel madam, as the Accademia Del Tiramis\u00f9 explains, to \"solve the problems they may have had with their conjugal duties on their return to their wives\".\n\nThere is evidence of a \"Tiremes\u00f9\" semi-frozen dessert served by the Vetturino restaurant in Pieris, in the Friuli Venezia Giulia, since 1938. This may be the name's origin, while the recipe for Tiramisu may have originated as a variation of another layered dessert, Zuppa Inglese.

Here's why:\n\n1. Authenticity: Tiramisu is a classic Italian dessert that originated in the 1960s in Treviso, and its traditional recipe features espresso, mascarpone cheese, and cocoa powder. The use of chocolate is an integral part of its flavor profile.\n2. Flavor balance: The combination of espresso, mascarpone, and cocoa powder creates a rich, balanced flavor that is hard to replicate with strawberries. The sweetness of the strawberries might overpower the other flavors, making the dish unbalanced.\n3. Texture: The ladyfingers soaked in espresso and liqueur, layered with mascarpone cream and cocoa powder, provide a unique texture that is characteristic of Tiramisu. Adding strawberries would change the texture of the dish, making it less traditional.\n4. Tradition: As mentioned in the text, Tiramisu was added to its menu in 1972 at Le Beccherie restaurant in Treviso, and it has since become a beloved dessert in Italy. Using strawberries might be seen as a deviation from the traditional recipe, which could alter the cultural significance of the dish.\n\nThat being said, if you want to create a unique dessert, you could consider making a Strawberry Tiramisu or a variation that incorporates strawberries in a creative way. For example, you could use strawberry puree or jam to add flavor to the mascarpone cream or use strawberry-infused liqueur to give the espresso a fruity twist. Just be sure to maintain the traditional flavors and textures of Tiramisu to ensure that the dish remains true to its Italian roots.", "shortest_response": "While both options sound delicious, the traditional and authentic Tiramisu is made with chocolate, specifically espresso-soaked ladyfingers layered with mascarpone cheese and cocoa powder.

Assemble the frame using hot glue.\n\n**Step 2: Cover the fuselage and wings with duct tape**\n\nCut the duct tape into long strips and wrap them around the frame, overlapping the edges to create a smooth surface. Use a combination of colors and widths to achieve the desired design.\n\n**Step 3: Create the wing skins**\n\nCut the plywood or cardboard into the required shapes and sizes for the wing skins. Attach them to the wing spars using hot glue.\n\n**Step 4: Add the wing ribs**\n\nCut the aluminum or PVC pipes into the required lengths and attach them to the wing skins using hot glue. These will provide additional structural support.\n\n**Step 5: Add the control surfaces**\n\nCut small pieces of plywood or cardboard and attach them to the wing tips using hot glue. These will provide control surfaces for the plane.\n\n**Step 6: Add the tail section**\n\nCut a small piece of plywood or cardboard and attach it to the back of the fuselage using hot glue. This will provide a stable tail section.\n\n**Step 7: Add the landing gear**\n\nCut small pieces of aluminum or PVC pipes and attach them to the fuselage using hot glue. These will provide a simple landing gear system.\n\n**Step 8: Add the cockpit**\n\nCut a small piece of plywood or cardboard and attach it to the front of the fuselage using hot glue. This will provide a simple cockpit.\n\n**Step 9: Add the final touches**\n\nUse sandpaper to smooth out any rough edges or surfaces. Paint or varnish the plane to protect it from the elements.\n\n**Step 10: Assemble and test**\n\nAssemble all the components and test the plane. However, please note that this plane will not be safe for flight or human passengers.\n\n**Safety considerations:**\n\n* This plane is not designed for flight or human passengers.\n* Do not attempt to fly this plane.\n* Use caution when handling sharp objects and hot glue.\n* Adult supervision is recommended for this project.\n\n**Tips and variations:**\n\n* Use different colors and patterns to create a unique design.\n* Add additional features, such as a propeller or engine.\n* Use other materials, such as cardboard or paper, to create a more lightweight and durable plane.\n* Experiment with different designs and shapes to create a more efficient and stable plane.\n\nRemember, building a duct tape plane is a creative and challenging project. Be patient, and don't be afraid to experiment and try new things.", "input_size": 69, "output_sizes": [747, 809, 867, 1033, 957, 811, 1010, 888, 916, 935], "output_mean": 897.3, "output_std": 86.77, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 825.0, "p50": 902.0, "p75": 951.5, "p99": 1030.93}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "brainstorming", "gen_time": 19.32557}, {"sample_id": "02143140a3ad3573", "prompt_id": "1361ba405492cac2", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Name a very famous family of composers & musicians of late baroque", "longest_response": "One very famous family of composers and musicians of the late Baroque period is the Bach family, specifically the Bachs of Leipzig.

Here are some reasons why dogs might be considered better for physical health:\n\n1. **Increased Physical Activity**: Dogs require regular exercise, such as walks, runs, or playtime, which can encourage their owners to engage in physical activity as well. This can help improve cardiovascular health, reduce obesity, and boost overall fitness.\n2. **Improved Cardiovascular Health**: Studies have shown that dog owners tend to have lower blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and body mass index (BMI) compared to non-dog owners. This may be due to the increased physical activity and stress-reducing effects of dog ownership.\n3. **Reduced Stress and Anxiety**: Interacting with dogs has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety levels, which can contribute to various physical health issues, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal disorders.\n4. **Social Benefits**: Dogs can help their owners meet new people and form social connections, which is particularly important for older adults or those living alone. Social isolation can have negative effects on physical health, including increased risk of chronic diseases.\n5. **Assistance with Mobility**: Some breeds of dogs, such as Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers, are often used as therapy dogs or assistance dogs. These dogs can provide emotional support and help with mobility issues, such as walking or balance problems.\n6. **Increased Vitamin D Levels**: Spending time outdoors with dogs can increase exposure to sunlight, which is essential for vitamin D production. Vitamin D is crucial for bone health, immune function, and overall physical well-being.\n7. **Improved Immune Function**: Studies have found that dog owners tend to have stronger immune systems, which can help protect against illnesses and infections.\n\nIt's essential to note that these benefits can vary depending on individual circumstances, such as the type of dog, owner's lifestyle, and pre-existing health conditions. Additionally, while dogs may offer physical health benefits, they also require care, attention, and resources, which can be a significant commitment.\n\nCats, on the other hand, may offer unique benefits, such as:\n\n1. **Low Maintenance**: Cats are generally easier to care for, requiring less attention and exercise than dogs.\n2. **Allergy Prevention**: Exposure to cats in early childhood may help prevent allergies later in life.\n3. **Stress Relief**: Interacting with cats has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety levels, although the effects may be less pronounced than those associated with dog ownership.\n\nUltimately, the decision between a dog and a cat comes down to individual preferences, lifestyle, and needs. Both animals can provide companionship and emotional support, but it's essential to consider the physical and emotional demands of dog ownership before making a decision.", "shortest_response": "While both dogs and cats can provide companionship and emotional support, dogs are often considered better for a person's physical health due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Increased Physical Activity**: Dogs require regular exercise, such as walks and playtime, which encourages their owners to engage in physical activity as well. This can lead to improved cardiovascular health, weight management, and reduced risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.\n2. **Assistance with Mobility**: Dogs, especially older or disabled individuals, can provide assistance with mobility and balance. Service dogs, for example, are trained to help people with physical disabilities, such as paralysis or multiple sclerosis.\n3. **Social Support**: Dogs can help their owners meet new people and form social connections, which is essential for mental and emotional well-being. Social support has been linked to lower blood pressure, reduced stress, and improved overall health.\n4. **Stress Reduction**: Interacting with dogs has been shown to reduce stress levels and lower cortisol (the stress hormone) levels. Playing with dogs, petting them, or simply watching them can calm the mind and promote relaxation.\n5. **Improved Mental Health**: The emotional support and companionship provided by dogs can help alleviate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions.\n6. **Responsibility and Structure**: Caring for a dog can provide a sense of purpose and responsibility, which can be especially beneficial for people with chronic illnesses or disabilities.\n7. **Therapy and Assistance**: Trained therapy dogs and assistance dogs can provide specific benefits, such as emotional support, mobility assistance, and even medical alert services.\n\nThat being said, cats can also provide physical health benefits, such as:\n\n* Lowering blood pressure and stress levels through affection and interaction\n* Providing companionship and social support\n* Encouraging physical activity through playtime and chasing\n* Offering emotional comfort and stress relief\n\nUltimately, both dogs and cats can be beneficial for physical health, and the choice between the two comes down to personal preference and individual needs.", "input_size": 48, "output_sizes": [484, 496, 500, 522, 496, 513, 466, 410, 472, 577], "output_mean": 493.6, "output_std": 40.62, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 475.0, "p50": 496.0, "p75": 509.75, "p99": 572.05}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "open_qa", "gen_time": 10.22619}, {"sample_id": "41d41829d140a608", "prompt_id": "ba3085fa0204bb72", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What are Singapore's official languages?\nContext: Singapore (/\u02c8s\u026a\u014b(\u0261)\u0259p\u0254\u02d0r/ (listen)), officially the Republic of Singapore, is an island country and city-state in maritime Southeast Asia.

Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n\nIn addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\nThe support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data.[citation needed] These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data to groups and, then, to map new data according to these clusters.", "longest_response": "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning model used for classification and regression analysis.

List in the format {name} - {year} in a semicolon list.\nContext: Radiohead are an English rock band formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.\n\nRadiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in 1993. Their debut single, \"Creep\", became a worldwide hit. Radiohead's popularity and critical standing rose with the release of The Bends in 1995. Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music.\n\nRadiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though Kid A divided listeners, it was later named the best album of the decade by multiple outlets. It was followed by Amnesiac (2001), recorded in the same sessions. Hail to the Thief (2003), with lyrics addressing the War on Terror, blended the band's rock and electronic sides, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI.\n\nRadiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway, and O'Brien have released solo albums; in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.\n\nBy 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart: \"Creep\" (1992), \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" (1996), \"Paranoid Android\" (1997), \"Karma Police\" (1997), \"No Surprises\" (1998), \"Pyramid Song\" (2001), and \"There There\" (2003). \"Creep\" and \"Nude\" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Rolling Stone named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and Rolling Stone readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s. Five Radiohead albums have been included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time lists.

This approach allows the model to capture the relationships between various factors that affect software development costs.\n\nThere are two main versions of the COCOMO model:\n\n1.

The model consists of a set of variables that are used to calculate the estimated cost of the project, including:\n\n1. Program complexity (PC): This variable measures the complexity of the software system, including factors such as the number of modules, the number of users, and the level of data processing.\n2.

It is an example of cannibalization.\nThe term alludes to the Osborne Computer Corporation, whose second product did not become available until more than a year after it was announced. The company's subsequent bankruptcy was widely blamed on reduced sales after the announcement.\nThe Osborne Effect states that prematurely discussing future, unavailable products damages sales of existing products. The name comes from the planned replacement of the Osborne 1, an early personal computer first sold by the Osborne Computer Corporation in 1981. In 1983, founder Adam Osborne pre-announced several next-generation computer models (the Osborne Executive and Osborne Vixen), which were only prototypes, highlighting the fact that they would outperform the existing model as the prototypes dramatically cut down assembly time. A widely held belief was that sales of the Osborne 1 fell sharply as customers anticipated those more advanced systems, leading to a sales decline from which Osborne Computer was unable to recover. This belief appeared in the media almost immediately after the company's September 1983 bankruptcy:\n\nTo give the jazzy $2,495 Osborne Executive a running start, Adam began orchestrating publicity early in 1983. We, along with many other magazines, were shown the machine in locked hotel rooms. We were required not to have anything in print about it until the planned release date in mid-April. As far as we know, nothing did appear in print, but dealers heard about the plans and cancelled orders for the Osborne 1 in droves. In early April, Osborne told dealers he would be showing them the machine on a one-week tour the week of 17 April, and emphasized that the new machine was not a competitor for the Osborne 1. But dealers didn't react the way Osborne expected; said Osborne, \"All of them just cancelled their orders for the Osborne 1.\"\n\nOsborne reacted by drastically cutting prices on the Osborne 1 in an effort to stimulate cash flow. But nothing seemed to work, and for several months sales were practically non-existent.\n\nPre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, with the revenue drop for the current product being offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available. However, when the Osborne effect occurs, the quantity of unsold goods increases and the company must react by discounting and/or lowering production of the current product, both of which depress cash flow.", "longest_response": "The price of the Osborne 1 is not explicitly mentioned in the passage.

The energy from sunlight is absorbed by pigments such as chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, which are present in the chloroplasts of plant cells. These pigments absorb light in the blue and red parts of the visible spectrum, but reflect light in the green part of the spectrum, which is why plants appear green to our eyes.\n\nThere are several reasons why chlorophyll is present in so many plants:\n\n1. **Photosynthesis**: Chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis, which is the primary way that plants produce energy and grow.\n2. **Light absorption**: Chlorophyll is able to absorb light energy from the sun, which is then used to power photosynthesis.\n3. **Protection from excessive light**: Chlorophyll helps to protect the plant from excessive light, which can damage the plant's cells and tissues.\n4. **Evolutionary advantage**: Chlorophyll has evolved in many plant species as a way to compete with other organisms for light energy.\n\nWhile chlorophyll is the main reason why plants appear green, there are other pigments that can also contribute to a plant's color. For example:\n\n* **Carotenoids**: These pigments are responsible for the yellow, orange, and red colors of some plants.\n* **Anthocyanins**: These pigments are responsible for the red, purple, and blue colors of some plants.\n* **Betacyanins**: These pigments are responsible for the red and purple colors of some plants.\n\nOverall, the combination of chlorophyll and other pigments in a plant determines its color, and chlorophyll is the main reason why many plants appear green.", "shortest_response": "Many plants are green because they contain a pigment called chlorophyll.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initial guess**: Start with an initial guess, `x0`, for the square root of the number `n`.\n2. **Divide**: Divide `n` by `x0` to get a quotient, `q = n / x0`.\n3. **Average**: Calculate the average of `x0` and `q`, which is the new estimate for the square root, `x1 = (x0 + q) / 2`.\n4. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2-3 with `x1` as the new initial guess until the desired level of precision is reached.\n\nThe method works because of the following properties:\n\n* **Convergence**: The sequence of estimates `x0`, `x1`, `x2`,... converges to the actual square root of `n`.\n* **Error reduction**: Each iteration reduces the error between the estimate and the actual square root by at least half.\n\nMathematically, we can prove the convergence and error reduction using the following equations:\n\n`x1 = (x0 + q) / 2`\n\n`q = n / x0`\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first, we get:\n\n`x1 = (x0 + n / x0) / 2`\n\n`x1 = (x0^2 + n) / (2x0)`\n\nNow, let's analyze the difference between `x1` and `x0`:\n\n`\u0394x = x1 - x0 = ((x0^2 + n) / (2x0)) - x0`\n\n`\u0394x = (x0^2 + n - 2x0^2) / (2x0)`\n\n`\u0394x = (n - x0^2) / (2x0)`\n\nSince `x0` is an estimate of the square root of `n`, we can assume that `x0^2` is close to `n`. Therefore, the error term `(n - x0^2)` is small.\n\nAs a result, the absolute value of `\u0394x` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the error term:\n\n`|\u0394x| \u2264 |n - x0^2| / (2|x0|)`\n\nSince `x0` is an estimate of the square root of `n`, we know that `|x0|` is greater than or equal to `\u221an`. Therefore, the denominator `2|x0|` is greater than or equal to `2\u221an`.\n\nSubstituting this inequality into the previous equation, we get:\n\n`|\u0394x| \u2264 |n - x0^2| / (2\u221an)`\n\nSince `x0^2` is close to `n`, the numerator `|n - x0^2|` is small. Therefore, the absolute value of `\u0394x` is also small.\n\nThis shows that each iteration reduces the error between the estimate and the actual square root by at least half. This is the key property that allows the method to converge to the actual square root.\n\nIn summary, the divide and average method for computing square roots works because it iteratively refines an initial guess using a simple formula that reduces the error by at least half at each step. The convergence and error reduction properties ensure that the method converges to the actual square root of the number.", "shortest_response": "The divide and average method, also known as the Babylonian method or Heron's method, is an ancient algorithm for computing square roots. It works by making an initial guess and then iteratively improving that guess until the desired level of accuracy is reached.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Start with an initial guess, `a`, for the square root of a number `x`. This guess should be positive, since the square root of a number is always non-negative.\n2. Calculate the average of `a` and `x/a`, which gives a new estimate for the square root. This is done using the formula: `b = (a + x/a) / 2`\n3. Repeat step 2 with `b` as the new estimate.\n4. Continue repeating steps 2-3 until the difference between consecutive estimates is less than a desired level of accuracy.\n\nThe method works because the average of `a` and `x/a` is closer to the actual square root than `a` is. This is due to the following mathematical property:\n\n`a^2 < x/a < (a + x/a) / 2 < sqrt(x)`\n\nThis property can be proven using algebraic manipulation. The left-hand side of the inequality is true by definition of a square root, and the right-hand side can be shown to be true by substituting the formula for the average of `a` and `x/a`.\n\nThe key insight behind the method is that each iteration refines the estimate by moving it closer to the midpoint of the interval between the current estimate and its reciprocal. This process converges to the actual square root, as the difference between consecutive estimates decreases with each iteration.\n\nThe divide and average method is an efficient and effective way to compute square roots, and it has been used for centuries in various forms. It's still widely used today in computer science and mathematics.", "input_size": 48, "output_sizes": [607, 745, 562, 571, 455, 385, 726, 527, 475, 640], "output_mean": 569.3, "output_std": 109.37, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 488.0, "p50": 566.5, "p75": 631.75, "p99": 743.29}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 13.34482}, {"sample_id": "0dfccd8250bb2d4e", "prompt_id": "3c03855fd21f1cec", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What are 6 different reasons to go on vacation?", "longest_response": "Here are six different reasons to go on vacation:\n\n1. **Relaxation and Stress Relief**: Vacations provide an opportunity to unwind, recharge, and escape the stresses of daily life.

As the largest optical telescope in space, it is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars, the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.\n\nThe U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led JWST's design and development and partnered with two main agencies: the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Maryland managed telescope development, while the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore on the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University currently operates JWST. The primary contractor for the project was Northrop Grumman. The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana, and arrived at the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point in January 2022. The first JWST image was released to the public via a press conference on 11 July 2022.\n\nJWST's primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated beryllium, which combined create a 6.5-meter-diameter (21 ft) mirror, compared with Hubble's 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). This gives JWST a light-collecting area of about 25 square meters, about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet and visible (0.1 to 0.8 \u03bcm), and near infrared (0.8\u20132.5 \u03bcm) spectra, JWST observes a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light (red) through mid-infrared (0.6\u201328.3 \u03bcm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below 50 K (\u2212223 \u00b0C; \u2212370 \u00b0F), such that the infrared light emitted by the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. It is deployed in a solar orbit near the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point, about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 mi) from Earth, where its five-layer sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\n\nInitial designs for the telescope, then named the Next Generation Space Telescope, began in 1996. Two concept studies were commissioned in 1999, for a potential launch in 2007 and a US$1 billion budget. The program was plagued with enormous cost overruns and delays; a major redesign in 2005 led to the current approach, with construction completed in 2016 at a total cost of US$10 billion. The high-stakes nature of the launch and the telescope's complexity were remarked upon by the media, scientists, and engineers.", "longest_response": "Here's a summary of the James Webb Space Telescope:\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a cutting-edge space telescope designed for infrared astronomy.

The skins also contribute to the wine's flavor and aroma, imparting notes of fruit, spices, and earthy undertones.\n\nThe winemaking process for orange wines typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. Harvesting: Grapes are harvested and crushed to release their juice and skins.\n2. Cold soak: The grape juice and skins are left to soak in cold temperatures (usually around 10-15\u00b0C/50-59\u00b0F) for several days to extract more flavor and color compounds.\n3. Skin contact: The grape juice and skins are left in contact for an extended period, often several weeks or months, to allow for further extraction of flavors and pigments.\n4. Fermentation: The wine is fermented at a relatively low temperature (usually around 15-20\u00b0C/59-68\u00b0F) to preserve the delicate flavors and aromas.\n5. Aging: The wine is aged in oak barrels or stainless steel tanks to mature and develop its flavors and aromas.\n\nOrange wines are often made from white grape varieties, such as Riesling, Gew\u00fcrztraminer, or Chardonnay, although some producers also experiment with red grape varieties.

Revenue and expense should be kept separate from personal expenses.\nGoing Concern: assumes that the business will be in operation indefinitely. This validates the methods of asset capitalization, depreciation, and amortization. Only when liquidation is certain this assumption is not applicable. The business will continue to exist in the unforeseeable future.\nMonetary Unit principle: assumes a stable currency is going to be the unit of record. The FASB accepts the nominal value of the US Dollar as the monetary unit of record unadjusted for inflation.\nTime-period principle: implies that the economic activities of an enterprise can be divided into artificial time periods.\nPrinciples\nHistorical cost principle: requires companies to account and report assets and liabilities acquisition costs rather than fair market value. This principle provides information that is reliable (removing opportunity to provide subjective and potentially biased market values), but not very relevant. Thus there is a trend to use fair values. Most debts and securities are now reported at market values.\nRevenue recognition principle: holds that companies should record revenue when earned but not when received. The flow of cash does not have any bearing on the recognition of revenue. This is the essence of accrual basis accounting. Conversely, however, losses must be recognized when their occurrence becomes probable, whether or not it has actually occurred. This comports with the constraint of conservatism, yet brings it into conflict with the constraint of consistency, in that reflecting revenues/gains is inconsistent with the way in which losses are reflected.\nMatching principle: expenses have to be matched with revenues as long as it is reasonable to do so. Expenses are recognized not when the work is performed, or when a product is produced, but when the work or the product actually makes its contribution to revenue. Only if no connection with revenue can be established, cost may be charged as expenses to the current period (e.g., office salaries and other administrative expenses). This principle allows greater evaluation of actual profitability and performance (shows how much was spent to earn revenue). Depreciation and Cost of Goods Sold are good examples of application of this principle.\nFull disclosure principle: Amount and kinds of information disclosed should be decided based on trade-off analysis as a larger amount of information costs more to prepare and use. Information disclosed should be enough to make a judgment while keeping costs reasonable. Information is presented in the main body of financial statements, in the notes or as supplementary information\nConstraints\nObjectivity principle: The company financial statements provided by the accountants should be based on objective evidence.\nMateriality principle: The significance of an item should be considered when it is reported. An item is considered significant when it would affect the decision of a reasonable individual.\nConsistency principle: The company uses the same accounting principles and methods from period to period.\nConservatism principle: When choosing between two solutions, the one which has the less favorable outcome is the solution which should be chosen (see convention of conservatism)\nCost Constraint: The benefits of reporting financial information should justify and be greater than the costs imposed on supplying it.", "longest_response": "The four basic principles of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) are:\n\n1. **Historical Cost Principle**: This principle requires companies to record assets and liabilities at their original acquisition cost, rather than their current market value.

This is the core of accrual basis accounting, and ensures that losses are recognized when they occur, even if not yet received.\n\n3. **Matching Principle**: This principle requires expenses to be matched with revenues in the same period, as long as it is reasonable to do so. This principle helps evaluate actual profitability and performance by matching costs with the revenues they help generate.\n\n4. **Full Disclosure Principle**: This principle requires companies to disclose sufficient information to make informed decisions, while keeping costs reasonable. The amount and type of information disclosed should be based on trade-off analysis, and should be presented in a way that is clear and understandable.\n\nThese four principles are fundamental to GAAP and provide a framework for accounting and financial reporting that is widely accepted and used by businesses and investors around the world.", "shortest_response": "The four basic principles of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) are:\n\n1. **Historical Cost Principle**: Requires companies to record assets and liabilities at their original acquisition costs, rather than their current market value.

Raw chicken: Not safe to eat unrefrigerated for 6 days. Raw poultry can pose a risk of foodborne illness, especially if it's not stored at a consistent refrigerated temperature below 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C). The risk of bacterial growth (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter) increases rapidly within 2 hours, and it's recommended to discard raw poultry after 2 hours at room temperature (73\u00b0F to 79\u00b0F or 23\u00b0C to 26\u00b0C).\n\n2. A jar of olives: Generally, olives are a low-risk food for spoilage, as they have a high acidity level (usually around 4.5 pH) that inhibits bacterial growth. Olives can be safely stored at room temperature for several days without refrigeration, but the exact duration depends on the specific type of olives, storage conditions, and personal tolerance for spoilage. However, as a general guideline, it's recommended to store olives in a cool, dark place for up to 2 weeks.\n\n3. Hard cheese: Hard cheeses, such as cheddar, Swiss, or Parmesan, can be safely stored at room temperature for several days without refrigeration. The acidity and low moisture content in hard cheeses create an environment that inhibits bacterial growth. However, it's essential to check the cheese for any visible signs of spoilage, such as mold, sliminess, or an off smell, before consuming it.\n\n4. Milk: Not safe to eat unrefrigerated for 6 days. Milk is a high-risk food for bacterial growth, particularly if it's not stored at a consistent refrigerated temperature below 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C). Bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria, and E. coli can multiply rapidly in milk, leading to spoilage and foodborne illness. It's recommended to discard milk after 3 to 5 days at room temperature.\n\n5. Fruit jelly: Fruit jelly is a low-risk food for spoilage, as it has a high acidity level (usually around 4.5 pH) that inhibits bacterial growth. Fruit jelly can be safely stored at room temperature for several days without refrigeration. However, it's essential to check the jelly for any visible signs of spoilage, such as mold, sliminess, or an off smell, before consuming it.\n\nIn summary, the safest foods to eat unrefrigerated for 6 days are the jar of olives and the hard cheese, but it's still crucial to check for any visible signs of spoilage before consumption.

Raw chicken: Raw chicken can pose a significant risk of foodborne illness if not stored and handled properly.

Her genre-spanning discography, songwriting abilities and artistic reinventions have received critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country artist to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.\nSwift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\nExiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021\u2014Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her 2022 album Midnights and single \"Anti-Hero\" broke all-time streaming records. Swift has directed music videos and films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and played supporting roles in others.\nHaving sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians in history. She is the most streamed woman on Spotify and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards; and 92 Guinness World Records. Swift has been featured in rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment.

Isn't it possible that the listener would associate \"pencil\" with \"wood\"? Maybe the listener would associate the word \"pencil\" with \"round\" instead (as pencils are, usually, in fact, round!). Wittgenstein writes regarding several possible \"interpretations\" which may arise after such a lesson. The student may interpret your pointing at a pencil and saying \"pencil\" to mean the following: (1) This is a pencil; (2) This is round; (3) This is wood; (4) This is one; (5) This is hard, etc., etc.", "longest_response": "According to Wittgenstein, the problem with learning a language using \"ostensive defining\" is that the listener may interpret the teacher's intention in multiple ways. As you mentioned, the listener may associate the word \"pencil\" with various characteristics or objects, such as \"wood\", \"round\", \"one\", or \"hard\", instead of the intended meaning.\n\nWittgenstein argues that this is a problem because language is not just a matter of pointing to objects and labeling them, but rather it involves a complex web of meanings, associations, and conventions. When we learn a language, we are not just learning a set of labels, but also the rules and norms that govern how those labels are used.\n\nIn the case of the example you provided, the listener may interpret the teacher's intention as meaning that the word \"pencil\" is associated with the characteristic of being \"round\", rather than the intended meaning of referring to a specific object.\n\nWittgenstein's concern is that if we rely solely on ostensive defining, we risk teaching the student a language that is fragmented and open to multiple interpretations. He argues that language must be learned and used in a way that takes into account the social and cultural context in which it is used, as well as the shared conventions and norms that govern its use.\n\nTo address this problem, Wittgenstein advocates for a more nuanced approach to language learning, one that involves not just pointing to objects and labeling them, but also teaching the student about the social and cultural context in which language is used, as well as the rules and norms that govern its use. This approach, which Wittgenstein calls \"language games\", involves teaching the student how to use language in a way that is meaningful and effective within a particular social and cultural context.", "shortest_response": "According to Wittgenstein, the problem with learning a language using \"ostensive defining\" is that it leaves room for multiple possible interpretations of the word or phrase being taught. In the example you provided, the teacher points to a pencil and says \"pencil,\" but the listener may interpret this in various ways, such as associating the word with the object's shape (\"round\"), material (\"wood\"), size (\"one\"), or other characteristics.\n\nWittgenstein argues that this ambiguity arises because the act of pointing and saying a word is not sufficient to convey the intended meaning. The listener's interpretation is based on their own prior experiences and associations, which may not match the teacher's intended meaning. This leads to a problem of communication, as the listener may not fully understand what the teacher is trying to convey.\n\nWittgenstein's concern is that language learning through ostensive defining can lead to a situation where the teacher and listener have different understandings of the word or phrase, even though they are using the same words and gestures. This highlights the importance of understanding the complexities of language use and the need for a more nuanced approach to language learning and teaching.", "input_size": 272, "output_sizes": [253, 284, 360, 293, 279, 289, 348, 234, 329, 292], "output_mean": 296.1, "output_std": 37.54, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 280.25, "p50": 290.5, "p75": 320.0, "p99": 358.92}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "information_extraction", "gen_time": 6.40469}, {"sample_id": "e6da5b341fd54fde", "prompt_id": "2678b784a17d61a6", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Write a letter to your friend expressing your feelings about earning your first wage.", "longest_response": "Dear [Friend's Name],\n\nI hope this letter finds you well.
