Answer In English after", "longest_response": "Yes, it is possible to create a script in Unity that detects CSV files as assets, extracts the data from the CSV files, and then creates scriptable objects within the CSV asset. Here's a high-level approach to achieving this:\n\n1. **CSV File Reading:** You can utilize libraries such as CsvHelper for reading CSV files. This library provides a simple and efficient way to read CSV files into objects in C#.\n\n2. **Creating Scriptable Objects:** Unity's scriptable objects don't have a built-in serialization system for CSV files, so you'll have to create a new scriptable object for each CSV field you want to store. Alternatively, you could create a more generic scriptable object with serialized arrays of the required data types.\n\n3. **Asset Postprocessing:** To automate the creation of scriptable objects from CSV files, you can use asset postprocessing APIs in Unity. When a CSV file is added to the project, your script will be triggered to read the file and create the corresponding scriptable objects.\n\nHere's an example of how the asset postprocessing script might look (Unity 2019.3 and later):\n\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEditor;\nusing CsvHelper;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Globalization;\n\n[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = \"CSVDataAsset\", menuName = \"ScriptableObjects/CSV Data Asset\")]\npublic class CSVDataAsset : ScriptableObject\n{\n    public List<RowData> rows;\n\n    [System.Serializable]\n    public class RowData\n    {\n        public int id;\n        public string field1;\n        public string field2;\n        // Add more fields as necessary\n    }\n}\n\n[PostProcessAll(PreprocessScriptAttribute.Nothing)]\npublic class CSVDataPostprocessor : AssetPostprocessor\n{\n    private const string targetAssetPath = \"Assets/CSV Data Assets\";\n\n    void OnPostprocessAllAssets(string[] importedAssets, string[] deletedAssets, string[] movedAssets, string[] movedFromAssetPaths)\n    {\n        foreach (var assetPath in importedAssets)\n        {\n            if (uriUtility.IsAssetsUrl(assetPath))\n            {\n                string localPath = AssetDatabase.GUIDToAssetPath(AssetDatabase.AssetPathToGUID(assetPath));\n\n                if (Path.GetExtension(localPath).ToLowerInvariant() == \".csv\")\n                {\n                    var asset = ScriptableObject.CreateInstance<CSVDataAsset>();\n                    using (var reader = new StreamReader(assetPath))\n                    {\n                        using (var csv = new CsvReader(reader, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture))\n                        {\n                            asset.rows = new List<CSVDataAsset.RowData>();\n                            while (csv.Read())\n                            {\n                                var row = new CSVDataAsset.RowData();\n                                // Set the row properties based on the CSV data\n                                // For example: row.field1 = csv.GetField<string>(0);\n\n                                asset.rows.Add(row);\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n\n                    // Replace the imported CSV file with the scriptable object\n                    AssetDatabase.CreateAsset(asset, Path.ChangeExtension(localPath, asset.GetType().Name));\n                    AssetDatabase.SaveAssets();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nReplace the example row properties with the fields from your CSV files and adjust the file saving path if necessary. This example assumes you have a folder named \"CSV Data Assets\" in your Assets, but you can change the targetAssetPath constant if your project structure is different.", "shortest_response": "Yes, it's possible to create a script in Unity Editor that detects and extracts data from a CSV file asset, and then creates a ScriptableObject with the extracted data. Here's a high-level overview of how you might approach this:\n\n1. **Create a CSVReader class**: This class should be responsible for reading the CSV file and converting its contents into a format that can be easily used by your scriptable object.\n\n2. **Create a ScriptableObject class**: This class should define the data structure of the data you're reading from the CSV file. It should also have a method for parsing the data read by the CSVReader.\n\n3. **Create a ScriptableObject Generator class**: This class should initialize the ScriptableObject with the data parsed from the CSV file, and then create an instance of that object. Finally, it should create an AssetDatabase.CreateAsset and AssetDatabase.SaveAssetIfDirty methods to save the generated ScriptableObject as a new asset.\n\n4. **Create an Editor script**: This script should be responsible for detecting new CSV files in the project and running the ScriptableObject Generator class for each one. You might do this by implementing OnPostprocessScene or OnPostprocessAllAssets in your Editor script.\n\nHere's a pseudo-code example for the ScriptableObjectGenerator class:\n\n```csharp\npublic class CsvScriptableObjectGenerator : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public TextAsset csvFile;\n    public CsvReader csvReader;\n    public CsvData csvData;\n\n    [Button(\"Generate Csv Data\")]\n    void Generate()\n    {\n        CsvData generatedData = csvReader.ReadCsv(csvFile);\n        ScriptableObject scriptableObject = ScriptableObject.CreateInstance<CsvScriptableObject>();\n        scriptableObject.Initialize(generatedData);\n\n        string assetPath = AssetDatabase.GetAssetPath(csvFile);\n        string assetName = Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(assetPath) + \"_Data\";\n        string path = assetPath + \"_Data.asset\";\n\n        AssetDatabase.CreateAsset(scriptableObject, path);\n        AssetDatabase.SaveAssets();\n        AssetDatabase.Refresh();\n    }\n}\n```", "input_size": 87, "output_sizes": [889, 706, 554, 863, 518, 685, 676, 756, 676, 775], "output_mean": 709.8, "output_std": 112.22, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 676.0, "p50": 695.5, "p75": 770.25, "p99": 886.66}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 22.20011}, {"sample_id": "d8fefa551f4b4cc1", "prompt_id": "b4183f6092734446", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "What are some common criticisms of use cases in software engineering?", "longest_response": "1. Lack of clarity and precision: Use cases can sometimes be vague, imprecise, or inconsistent, making it challenging for developers to translate them into functional requirements and design decisions. This may lead to misunderstandings, errors, and rework.\n\n2. Overemphasis on functionality and underemphasis on non-functional requirements: Use cases often focus on describing the system's behavior and the interactions between users and the system. They might not adequately address non-functional requirements, such as performance, security, usability, maintainability, and scalability.\n\n3. Ignoring constraints and assumptions: Use cases may not account for important constraints and assumptions, leading to unrealistic or unattainable requirements. For example, a use case may assume the availability of a specific hardware or software component, or it may not consider the limitations of the system's resources.\n\n4. Failure to capture system behavior in complex or unusual scenarios: Use cases may not sufficiently cover complex or unusual scenarios, leading to incomplete or incorrect models of the system's behavior. This can result in poorly designed or implemented systems that do not meet user needs in edge cases.\n\n5. Limited reusability: Use cases are often tailored to specific systems, making it difficult to reuse them in other projects or to apply them to similar systems. This increases development time and effort, and can lead to duplicated work.\n\n6. Complexity and time-consuming: The process of creating use cases can be time-consuming and requires significant effort from stakeholders. This can be challenging for projects with tight timelines or limited resources. Additionally, the sheer number of use cases for a complex system can make the documentation overly complex and difficult to maintain.\n\n7. Inadequate validation and verification: Use cases may not be properly validated and verified, leading to errors or omissions. This can result in incorrect assumptions about the system's behavior or functionality, and may require costly rework during the development or testing phases.\n\n8. Inconsistency across use cases and other documentation: Use cases may not be consistently defined, structured, or documented throughout a project, making it difficult to maintain consistency and ensuring that all stakeholders understand the system's requirements and design.\n\n9. Failure to consider the whole system: Use cases may focus on individual features or components of the system, without considering the overall system architecture, inter-dependencies, and interactions. This can lead to poor system design, performance issues, and difficulties in integration.\n\n10. Over-reliance on use cases: Some teams may over-rely on use cases as the sole source of requirements and design, neglecting alternative methods such as architecture modeling, scenario-based testing, or user-centered design approaches. This can result in an overly prescriptive and inflexible system design, making it difficult to accommodate changes or adapt to user needs over time.\n\nTo mitigate these criticisms, it is essential to develop well-structured, clear, and precise use cases that adequately address functional and non-functional requirements, account for constraints and assumptions, and cover complex and unusual scenarios. Collaboration between stakeholders and ongoing validation and verification of use cases can also help ensure that the final system meets user needs and delivers the desired functionality.", "shortest_response": "1. Lack of Concreteness: Use cases are often criticized for being too abstract and not providing enough concrete details about the system's behavior. This can make it difficult for developers to fully understand what is required.\n\n2. Variability: Some use cases can be overly complex, containing many variant and alternative flows. This complexity can make the use case difficult to understand and maintain.\n\n3. Ambiguity: Use cases can be open to interpretation, leading to differing understandings among stakeholders. This ambiguity can lead to mistakes and miscommunications.\n\n4. Not User-Focused Enough: While use cases are supposed to be focused on the user, they can sometimes become too functional or technical, losing sight of the user's needs and goals.\n\n5. Not Complete: Use cases may not cover all possible scenarios, leading to gaps in the system's functionality.\n\n6. Inefficiency: The process of creating and maintaining use cases can be time-consuming, especially for large and complex systems. This can lead to delays in the development process.\n\n7. Lack of Tools Support: There are no standard tools for creating and managing use cases, making it difficult to ensure consistency across a project.\n\n8. Limited Visibility of System Behavior: Use cases focus on the interaction between the user and the system, but they do not provide a complete view of the system's behavior. This can lead to missed requirements or inconsistencies.\n\n9. Over-Reliance: Some developers may over-rely on use cases, neglecting other analysis and design techniques that could provide complementary insights.\n\n10.

Set up the `index.html` and `index.js` files in the `frontend` directory:\n\n   Create a `public/index.html` file in the `frontend` directory with the following content:\n\n   ```html\n   <!DOCTYPE html>\n   <html lang=\"en\">\n     <head>\n       <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n       <title>React and Node.js App</title>\n     </head>\n     <body>\n       <div id=\"root\"></div>\n     </body>\n   </html>\n   ```\n\n   Create a `src/index.js` file in the `frontend` directory with the following content:\n\n   ```javascript\n   import React from 'react';\n   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n   import App from './App';\n\n   ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));\n   ```\n\n10. Install `concurrently` for running both frontend and backend simultaneously:\n\n   In the root directory, run:\n\n   ```\n   npm install --save-dev concurrently\n   ```\n\n   Configure the `scripts` section in `package.json`:\n\n   ```json\n   \"scripts\": {\n     \"start:frontend\": \"webpack serve --mode development --open\",\n     \"start:backend\": \"nodemon backend/\",\n     \"start\": \"concurrently \\\"npm run start:frontend\\\" \\\"npm run start:backend\\\"\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n11. Run the development server:\n\n   In the root directory, run:\n\n   ```\n   npm run start\n   ```\n\n   You can now access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.\n\n12. To create dummy data, manually POST requests to `http://localhost:5000/api/users` with appropriate data.\n\n13. To build the project for production, run:\n\n   In the `frontend` directory, run:\n\n   ```\n   npm run build\n   ```\n\n   This will create a `build` folder containing the production-ready files.\n\n14. To deploy the application, you can use Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers like Heroku or Netlify, or create your own server using a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.\n\n   For deploying on Heroku, follow these steps:\n\n   - Create a new app on Heroku: `heroku create myapp`\n\n   - Install Heroku CLI package locally: `npm install --save-dev heroku`\n\n   - Add a build script in `scripts` section of `package.json`:\n\n     ```json\n     \"scripts\": {\n       ...\n       \"heroku-postbuild\": \"npm install --production && NODE_ENV=production node backend/server.js\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - Commit all changes and deploy to Heroku:\n\n     ```\n     git add .\n     git commit -m \"Add heroku-postbuild script\"\n     git push heroku master\n     ```\n\n   - Configure environment variables on Heroku, such as MONGODB_URI, PORT, and NODE_ENV.\n\n   You can now access the production application at `https://your-heroku-app-name.herokuapp.com`.", "shortest_response": "Creating a full-fledged React, Node.js, and Express.js web application that allows creating or adding dummy data, displaying it, and explaining the deployment process will be quite extensive. Instead, I will outline the steps involved in creating such a web app and provide a high-level overview of the deployment process.\n\n1. **Set up project structure:**\n   - Create a server-side Node.js and Express.js application.\n   - Create a client-side React application.\n\n2. **Develop the backend API:**\n   - Implement API endpoints to create/add, edit, delete, and retrieve data.\n   - Set up a database (e.g., MongoDB) to store the data and utilize an ORM (e.g., Mongoose) to interact with the database.\n\n3. **Develop the frontend:**\n   - Create React components to handle form submission, lists, and individual items.\n   - Utilize Axios or Fetch to make requests to the backend API.\n\n4. **Connect frontend to backend:**\n   - Set up CORS on the backend to allow requests from the frontend.\n   - Handle authentication and authorization if needed.\n\nNow, let's assume you have developed the application and want to build and deploy it.\n\n1. **Build the React application:**\n   - Navigate to the client folder and run the command: `npm run build`. This will generate a production-ready build in the 'build' folder.\n\n2. **Build and serve the Node.js and Express.js app (backend):**\n   - Run the command: `npm install --save express express-static cors body-parser` to install necessary packages for serving static files and handling HTTP requests.\n   - Create a production-ready build of your server-side application using `npm run build` or `npm run production`.\n\n3. **Deploy the application:**\n   - Deployment may involve different steps depending on the hosting service you choose. Here's a brief overview for two popular deployment options:\n\n   - **Heroku:**\n     1. Create an account and install Heroku CLI.\n     2. Initialize and log in to Heroku in the backend folder.\n     3. Create a new Heroku app by running `heroku create`.\n     4. Add the MongoDB add-on if necessary.\n     5. Link the app to your GitHub repository.\n     6. Push your code to the repository: `git push heroku master`.\n     7. For the React application, download the build folder and add it to the Heroku app with static files. Alternatively, you can serve the React app with a Node.js middleware and use a build tool like Webpack.\n\n   - **AWS:**\n     1. Sign up and log in to AWS services.\n     2. Create an EC2 instance and S3 bucket for serving static files.\n     3. Set up an Auto Scaling Group for your EC2 instances.\n     4. Configure a Load Balancer to distribute traffic among your EC2 instances.\n     5. Configure security groups to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic to your instances.\n     6. Install Node.js, npm, and your application dependencies on the EC2 instances.\n     7. Configure your Express.js application to serve static files from the S3 bucket and handle API requests.\n     8. Start your application and configure the Load Balancer to point to your EC2 instances.\n\nIn both cases, you will need to configure environment variables for database credentials, API secrets, and other sensitive information.

This makes it challenging to ensure that materials used in products and services come from ethical and sustainable sources.\n\n4. Energy Efficiency: While there is a growing demand for more energy-efficient devices, achieving energy efficiency improvements can involve substantial investment in research and development (R&D) and manufacturing process modifications.\n\n5. Carbon Footprint: The carbon footprint of tech companies is high due to large amounts of electricity consumption and transport of goods. Reducing carbon emissions requires significant investments in renewable energy, energy storage, and zero-emission transportation solutions.\n\n6. Regulation and Reporting: Tech companies are subject to various environmental regulations, especially with regards to chemicals, waste management, and energy use. Compliance with these regulations and reporting on sustainability performance can be costly and complex.\n\n7. Consumer Expectations: Consumers are becoming increasingly interested in the sustainability practices of the companies they patronize. Meeting and exceeding their expectations for responsible and sustainable business practices can be a challenge.\n\n8. Technological Innovation: The development of new technologies that can help improve sustainability in the tech industry (e.g., clean energy, recyclable materials, circular economy models) faces challenges such as high development costs, technological limitations, and resistance to change from established players.\n\n9. Balancing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Shareholder Value: Investing in sustainability initiatives can have immediate financial costs, leading to concerns about balancing these investments with the duty to maximize shareholder value. Companies must find ways to prioritize sustainability while still meeting financial objectives.\n\n10. Lifecycle Assessment: Determining the environmental impact of a product from cradle to grave (i.e., assessing its entire lifecycle) can be challenging, as it requires data from various stages of the product's life, from materials sourcing to end-of-life disposal or recycling. This data may not always be easily accessible or accurately tracked, and comparing the sustainability performance of different products can be difficult.\n\nTo address these challenges, tech companies must collaborate with governments, NGOs, academia, and other stakeholders, engage in cross-industry partnerships, invest in research and development, and adopt innovative strategies that prioritize sustainability while maintaining competitiveness in the market.", "shortest_response": "High-tech businesses in the USA, like many other industries, face several challenges when striving to improve their sustainability scores:\n\n1. **Cost**: Implementing sustainable practices can be costly, especially for smaller businesses.

The story serves as a timeless exploration of love, self-acceptance, and the power of sacrifice.\n\nIntroduction:\nIn the pantheon of Greek mythology, love stories have always held a unique place. Among these is the tale of Eros and Psyche, a romantic journey that transcends time and culture. This paper aims to delve into the intricacies of the love story between Eros, the god of love, and Psyche, a mortal woman, as they traverse the labyrinth of their relationship.\n\nBody:\nThe story begins with Psyche belonging to a royal family plagued with misfortune, as an oracle prophecies that one of the daughters will surpass Aphrodite, the Goddess of Beauty, in beauty. To prevent this, Aphrodite curses Psyche to be loved by the most dreadful and ugly beast, forcing her to live in isolation.\n\nOne night, Psyche is visited by Eros, who has fallen in love with her at first sight. Despite her fear, they spend the night together. In the morning, Eros leaves before Psyche can see his face, instructing her not to look. However, due to her natural curiosity, Psyche defies Eros and looks upon him, accidentally smashing a cup of venom that he had been holding, causing him great pain.\n\nEros punishes Psyche by asking Aphrodite to make Psyche fall in love with a hideous creature. Psyche's family attempts to persuade her to marry a hideous neighbor, whom she finds repulsive, causing her great distress.\n\nMeanwhile, Eros goes to his mother, Aphrodite, and asks for her to undo the curse. Aphrodite sets Psyche three seemingly impossible tasks: to gather the beauty essence of Proserpina, the goddess of the underworld; to retrieve a box of Helios, the sun god, containing his golden locks; and to bring back a portion of the flock from the Gorgon Medusa, who turns anything she looks upon into stone.\n\nOvercoming adversity, Psyche completes each task, demonstrating her resourcefulness and courage. When she visits Aphrodite to present the completed tasks, Aphrodite reveals Eros' identity and convinces Psyche that he has abandoned her. Heartbroken, Psyche goes to Mount Olympus to throw herself off a cliff, but Eros, having regained his strength, saves her.\n\nIn the end, Zeus, king of the gods, convinces Aphrodite to allow Eros and Psyche to marry. Eros and Psyche are wed in a magnificent ceremony, and they eventually have a child together. The story concludes with the couple living happily ever after, as a testament to the power of true love.\n\nConclusion:\nThe love story of Eros and Psyche serves as a timeless exploration of love, sacrifice, and self-acceptance. Despite the challenges they face, they are able to overcome the obstacles and find happiness together. Their story continues to inspire and captivate audiences around the world, reminding us of the enduring power of love.\n\nBibliography:\n1. Bulfinch, Thomas. Bulfinch's Mythology.

By implementing privileged instructions, the operating system is able to interact directly with these low-level device interfaces to ensure proper functioning of the hardware. This approach ensures that user-mode applications don't accidentally damage the device or the system as a whole.\n\n4. Error handling and abstraction: Handling errors that might occur while accessing I/O devices can be complex and error-prone for user-mode applications. By providing privileged instructions, the operating system assumes responsibility for managing errors and providing higher-level abstractions for user-mode processes, like file system APIs or device drivers, making it easier for applications to interact with I/O devices.\n\nIn summary, privileged instructions for I/O device access help ensure system security, stability, and manageability, while abstracting the complexities of low-level device interaction from user-mode applications.", "shortest_response": "Instructions related to accessing I/O devices are privileged because they require direct control over system resources and potential access to sensitive data. Allowing unchecked access to these instructions in user mode can lead to security vulnerabilities and system instability. For example, a malicious user could potentially tamper with system settings, steal data, or disrupt system functions by reading from or writing to I/O devices without proper authorization. By making these instructions privileged and executable only in kernel mode, the operating system can enforce proper access controls and ensure the security and integrity of the system as a whole.", "input_size": 51, "output_sizes": [324, 123, 271, 198, 154, 179, 344, 130, 381, 336], "output_mean": 244.0, "output_std": 92.97, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 160.25, "p50": 234.5, "p75": 333.0, "p99": 377.67}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 8.19122}, {"sample_id": "1f62d12b48fa0024", "prompt_id": "58851b5b8c80b18a", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "how to confess to a girl with no emotion behind it", "longest_response": "Confessing your feelings to someone can be a sensitive and challenging situation, especially if you want to do it without showing too much emotion.

Components are function-like or class-based.\n\n   Here is a simple example of a function-based component called `Greeting` that returns a JSX element:\n\n   ```javascript\n   function Greeting({ name }) {\n     return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Props**: Props (short for properties) are parameters that you pass to a component. They allow components to accept data from their parents and provide a way for components to communicate with each other.\n\n   In the example above, `Greeting` component takes a prop named `name`.\n\n3. **State**: State is used to store and access data within a component. It's essential for rendering components based on dynamic data (e.g., user input).\n\n   A class-based component called `Counter` is shown below, demonstrating state:\n\n   ```javascript\n   class Counter extends React.Component {\n     constructor(props) {\n       super(props);\n       this.state = { count: 0 };\n     }\n\n     increment() {\n       this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\n     }\n\n     render() {\n       return (\n         <div>\n           <h1>You clicked {this.state.count} times.</h1>\n           <button onClick={() => this.increment()}>Click me</button>\n         </div>\n       );\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Hooks**: Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. For example, `useState` helps you add state to function components.\n\n   Refactoring the `Counter` component above using `useState`:\n\n   ```javascript\n   import React, { useState } from 'react';\n\n   function Counter() {\n     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n     const increment = () => {\n       setCount(count + 1);\n     };\n\n     return (\n       <div>\n         <h1>You clicked {count} times.</h1>\n         <button onClick={increment}>Click me</button>\n       </div>\n     );\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Event Handling**: You can handle user events (e.g., click, keydown, forms) in different ways in React. Binding, using arrow functions, or using anonymous functions are possible techniques.\n\n   In the examples above, the `onClick` event handler was set on the button component.\n\n6. **Rendering**: By default, React uses a Virtual DOM to render components. This improves performance by minimizing direct access to the browser's actual DOM.\n\n7. **Lifecycle Methods**: In class components, there are three lifecycle methods: `constructor`, `componentDidMount`, and `shouldComponentUpdate`. In functional components, React uses several lifecycle hooks, such as `useEffect`.\n\n8. **Form Handling**: Handling forms in React can be done in several ways, but I recommend using the `useRef` and `useState` hooks combined with `event.preventDefault()`.\n\n   Here is a simple form using `useRef` and `useState`:\n\n   ```javascript\n   import React, { useState, useRef } from 'react';\n\n   function Form() {\n     const [userInput, setUserInput] = useState('');\n     const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n     const onFormSubmit = (event) => {\n       event.preventDefault();\n       console.log('Form value:', userInput);\n       inputRef.current.value = '';\n     };\n\n     return (\n       <form onSubmit={onFormSubmit}>\n         <label>\n           Name:\n           <input type=\"text\" ref={inputRef} onChange={(event) => setUserInput(event.target.value)} />\n         </label>\n         <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n       </form>\n     );\n   }\n   ```\n\nThese concepts will help you get started with learning React. Practice building simple components, and gradually experiment with creating more complex app structures. Happy coding!", "shortest_response": "Absolutely! I'd be happy to help you strengthen your React skills. Here are some key concepts and resources that might help:\n\n1. **Components**: Each component in React is a self-contained piece of code that can manage its own state and render HTML. Components can accept data through props and compose other components to form complex UIs.\n\n2. **JSX**: This is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JS files.\n\n3. **State and Lifecycle**: Each component can have its own state, which can be used to manage dynamically-changing data in the component. The lifecycle of a component includes various stages as it gets mounted, updated, or unmounted.\n\n4. **Props**: Props (short for \"properties\") are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.\n\n5. **Hooks**: Introduced in React 16.8, Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Some popular Hooks include useState, useEffect, and useContext.\n\n6. **Redux**: For managing application-wide state, especially in larger applications.\n\n7. **Resources**: Here are some resources to help with learning React:\n  - [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html): The official React documentation is a great place to start.\n  - [The Net Ninja's Complete ReactJS Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbF5DyHnCwU): A beginner-friendly YouTube tutorial.\n  - [React Developer Roadmap](https://react-roadmap.gitbook.io/): This roadmap lays out a systematic approach to understanding the React ecosystem.\n\nI'd recommend starting by building small, focused projects that emphasize individual React concepts or features.

GraphQL provides several built-in types that you can use to define your schema, as well as custom types that you can define to better fit the structure of your data.\n\nHere are some of the common built-in GraphQL types:\n\n1. Scalar types: These are the basic data types in GraphQL, such as:\n   - Int: Represents a whole number.\n   - Float: Represents a decimal number.\n   - String: Represents a sequence of characters.\n   - Boolean: Represents true or false values.\n   - ID: Represents a unique identifier.\n\n2. Object types: These are used to define complex data structures that can contain multiple fields. An object type is defined by specifying the fields it contains and their types. For example:\n\n```\ntype Person {\n  id: ID!\n  name: String!\n  age: Int\n  isMarried: Boolean\n  hobbies: [String!]!\n}\n```\n\nThe `!` symbol indicates that the field is required, and the square brackets `[]` indicate that the field can contain multiple values.\n\n3. Interface types: These are used to define a common structure that multiple types can implement. Interfaces are useful for defining base types that may be extended by multiple types. For example:\n\n```\ninterface User {\n  id: ID!\n  name: String!\n}\ntype Customer implements User {\n  email: String!\n}\ntype Employee implements User {\n  salary: Float!\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, both the `Customer` and `Employee` types implement the `User` interface and have the required `id` and `name` fields. They also have additional fields specific to their respective types (`email` for `Customer` and `salary` for `Employee`).\n\n4. Enum types: These are used to define a fixed set of possible values that a field can take. For example:\n\n```\nenum JobStatus {\n  ACTIVE\n  INACTIVE\n  TERMINATED\n}\ntype Employee {\n  id: ID!\n  name: String!\n  jobStatus: JobStatus!\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `JobStatus` enum has three possible values: `ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE`, and `TERMINATED`, and the `Employee` type has a `jobStatus` field that can take one of these values.\n\n5. Union types: These are used to define a type that can represent one of several possible types. For example:\n\n```\nunion UserUnion = Customer | Employee\ntype Query {\n  user(id: ID!): UserUnion\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `UserUnion` type can represent either a `Customer` or an `Employee` type, and the `user` field of the `Query` type can return either a `Customer` or an `Employee` object.\n\nBy using these types and combining them in various ways, you can define complex and flexible data models in GraphQL.", "shortest_response": "GraphQL is a data query and manipulation language for APIs.

Enum Types: These are a set of possible values. They are useful for describing data that can only be one of a specific, predefined set of values.\n\n6. Input Object Types: These are used to specify the input for creating or updating objects. They group together a set of scalars and other input types for a specific use case, like creating a new user or updating a post.\n\n7.

There are no explicit provisions in this legislation aimed directly at helping the elderly become more familiar and safe accessing the internet with digital devices.\n\nHowever, there are a few potential areas within the IIJA where resources could indirectly benefit senior citizens in terms of internet access and digital literacy:\n\n1. Broadband Expansion: The bill provides $65 billion for broadband infrastructure development, ensuring that unserved and underserved communities, including rural and tribal areas, have access to high-speed internet. While this does not directly target seniors, better connectivity in their neighborhoods could help them access the digital world more easily.\n\n2. Digital Equity Grants: The legislation provides $2.75 billion in grants for digital equity, with priority given to projects that serve underserved communities, including low-income households and those with limited digital literacy skills. Older adults might be eligible for some of these programs, but it will depend on how individual states and organizations define and prioritize digital equity within their communities.\n\n3. Public Computer Centers: The IIJA allocates $1 billion to the establishment, improvement, and maintenance of public computer centers. These centers could offer senior citizens a place to learn about and get hands-on experience with digital devices and internet safety. However, the effectiveness of these centers in reaching and serving seniors will depend on their locations, resources, and community outreach efforts.\n\n4. Education and Training Programs: The bill includes $1 billion for workforce development and training programs that can help create a skilled workforce to support the implementation and maintenance of the new infrastructure. While not specifically aimed at seniors, some of these programs might offer resources, such as workshops or tutorials, tailored to older adults.\n\nOverall, while the IIJA doesn't have dedicated provisions to help the elderly become more familiar and safe using the internet, the funds allocated for broadband expansion, digital equity, public computer centers, and workforce development could potentially benefit senior citizens indirectly.

Here's a breakdown of some features and potential phenomena:\n\n1. Absence of Axial Tilt: Because the moon has no axial tilt, it doesn't experience seasons like Earth does. Since this moon receives reflected light from the gas giant, it doesn't follow a precise day-night cycle like Earth. Instead, its light-dark cycles could be irregular and complex, influenced by the orbit and rotation of both the moon and the gas giant.\n\n2. Geothermal and Freshwater springs: The presence of subsurface water (likely left over from the moon's formation) could create geothermal hot springs as the water interacts with the moon's internal heat. Freshwater springs may also occur at the surface due to geological activity or the moon's interaction with the gas giant's magnetic field.\n\n3. Brackish rivers and salt lakes: As geothermal hot springs and freshwater springs meet, they create brackish rivers. These rivers flow into low-lying areas, where they pool into salt lakes. Because there are no true oceans on this moon, the lake effect from these brackish rivers and salt lakes plays an essential role in shaping the moon's climate and weather.\n\n4. No Oceanic currents: Without oceans, there won't be ocean currents. However, brackish rivers and salt lake evaporation could potentially create wind patterns and help regulate heat distribution.\n\n5. A unique moon ecosystem: The absence of seasons, complex light-dark cycle, and geothermal activities could create a diverse and unique biome on the moon's surface. Life, if it exists, might be adapted to thrive in brackish environments or thermal vents.\n\n6. Geological activity: The interaction between the moon, gas giant, and their gravitational forces could potentially generate seismic activities, contributing to geothermal heat and shaping the landscape further.\n\nThis moon would be an exciting subject for further study and could potentially reveal insights about the formation and evolution of celestial bodies, as well as the potential habitability of non-terrestrial environments.", "shortest_response": "In the scenario you've described, we have a unique moon orbiting a gas giant planet, with a sun-gas giant-moon relationship that results in irregular light-dark cycles and long twilight periods. The moon, devoid of an axial tilt, experiences lengthy days and brief nights due to the reflected light from the gas giant and the sun.\n\nThe surface of the moon would be home to geothermal hot springs and freshwater springs as a result of subterranean water reservoirs. These water sources would eventually meet to form brackish rivers, which would flow towards the lower-lying areas and converge to form salt lakes.\n\nThe absence of traditional oceans implies that the lake effect caused by these brackish rivers and salt lakes would take the role typically played by oceans.

I need to use this widget in multiple applications. \nBasically, I should create a widget that can be imported from a link, and we should be able to use that in different applications. Can you tell me the whole procedure to get this done, step by step?", "longest_response": "To create an embeddable widget for your HTML form component that can be used across multiple applications, you'll need to follow several steps. I will explain the process using modern JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and a popular library called jQuery for simplifying the DOM manipulation. Let's go!\n\n1. Create a new folder for your project called `hotel-search-widget`.\n\n2. Inside the `hotel-search-widget` folder, create the three following files:\n   - index.html\n   - style.css\n   - script.js\n\n3. To start, open the `index.html` file and enter the following basic structure:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>Hotel Search Widget</title>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n  <!-- Your HTML form here -->\n  <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n4. In the `style.css` file, add basic styling for the form:\n\n```css\nbody {\n  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n}\n\nlabel,\ninput,\nbutton {\n  display: block;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n```\n\n5. Add the form structure to the `index.html` file, and add the required form elements:\n\n```html\n<form id=\"hotel-search-form\">\n  <label for=\"location\">Location:</label>\n  <input type=\"text\" id=\"location\" placeholder=\"Enter location\" required>\n\n  <label for=\"checkin\">Check-In:</label>\n  <input type=\"date\" id=\"checkin\" required>\n\n  <label for=\"checkout\">Check-Out:</label>\n  <input type=\"date\" id=\"checkout\" required>\n\n  <label for=\"occupancy\">Occupancy:</label>\n  <input type=\"number\" id=\"occupancy\" min=\"1\" required>\n\n  <button type=\"submit\">Search</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n6. Now, let's add some JavaScript to the widget. In the `script.js` file, first, get references to the form elements and variables to store the data.\n\n```javascript\nconst form = document.getElementById(\"hotel-search-form\");\nconst location = document.getElementById(\"location\");\nconst checkin = document.getElementById(\"checkin\");\nconst checkout = document.getElementById(\"checkout\");\nconst occupancy = document.getElementById(\"occupancy\");\n```\n\n7. In the `script.js` file, prevent the form from submitting normally, and instead execute custom logic:\n\n```javascript\n// Prevent the form from submitting normally\nform.addEventListener(\"submit\", function (event) {\n  event.preventDefault();\n\n  // Gather the user's inputs\n  const formData = {\n    location: location.value,\n    checkin: checkin.value,\n    checkout: checkout.value,\n    occupancy: occupancy.value,\n  };\n\n  // Call the callback function passed by the parent application (see step 10)\n  if (onSubmit) {\n    onSubmit(formData);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n8. Now, you need to create a way to communicate between the widget and the parent application. For this, you'll create a callback function property called `onSubmit` that can be set on the widget by the parent application:\n\n```javascript\nlet onSubmit;\n\nexport function setOnSubmit(callback) {\n  onSubmit = callback;\n}\n```\n\n9. Save the `hotel-search-widget` folder as a ZIP file. This file will serve as the widget package that can be shared and imported.\n\n10. Now, in the parent application, include the widget in your project:\n    a. Import the widget ZIP file.\n    b. Extract the contents of the widget ZIP file, resulting in three files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.\n    c. Create a `widget` folder in your parent application and place the widget files inside (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`).\n    d. Include the widget HTML file `index.html` in your parent application.\n    e. Add the script to call the `setOnSubmit` function, passing in the callback function that will handle the submitted data:\n\n```javascript\n// Assuming the widget script is loaded asynchronously\nconst widgetScript = document.createElement(\"script\");\nwidgetScript.src = \"./widget/script.js\";\nwidgetScript.onload = function () {\n  // Set the callback function on the widget instance\n  HotelSearchWidget.setOnSubmit(function (formData) {\n    // Handle the form data as needed\n    // Open another page or make an AJAX request, for example\n    window.location.href = \"search-results.html?\" + new URLSearchParams(formData);\n  });\n};\ndocument.head.appendChild(widgetScript);\n```\n\n11. Now, in your parent application's `index.html`, include the widget HTML as shown below:\n\n```html\n<!-- Include the widget HTML -->\n<div id=\"widget-container\">\n  <img src=\"loading.gif\" id=\"widget-loading\" style=\"display: none\">\n  <div id=\"widget\"></div>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n  // Create a new instance of the HotelSearchWidget and append it to the widget container\n  const widgetContainer = document.getElementById(\"widget-container\");\n  const widget = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  const loading = document.getElementById(\"widget-loading\");\n  loading.style.display = \"block\";\n  fetch(\"/widget/index.html\")\n    .then((response) => response.text())\n    .then((html) => {\n      widget.innerHTML = html;\n      widgetContainer.appendChild(widget);\n      loading.style.display = \"none\";\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\nNow, you have created an embeddable widget that can be imported by different applications. The parent application initializes the widget and sets the callback function for handling submitted form data and opening a new page or making AJAX requests. Good luck with your project!", "shortest_response": "To create an embeddable widget for your HTML form component, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Plan your widget structure**:\n   - Define the required fields such as location, check-in, check-out dates, and occupancy.\n   - Decide on the design and UI of the widget.\n   - Plan how to handle user inputs and what should happen when the search button is clicked.\n\n2. **Set up the HTML structure**:\n   - Create an HTML file with the structure of your widget. Include input fields for the user's information and a search button.\n   - Add an action attribute to the search button to handle the form submission, for example: `<button type=\"submit\" id=\"search-btn\">Search</button>`\n   - Make the HTML file self-contained; include CSS and JavaScript within the HTML file or link to external files as needed.\n\n3. **Style the widget (CSS)**:\n   - Use CSS to style your widget, including the inputs, labels, and button.\n   - Make sure the widget is responsive to fit in various applications.\n\n4. **Add interactivity (JavaScript)**:\n   - Use JavaScript (or a JavaScript library like jQuery) to handle the form submission.\n   - When the search button is clicked, prevent the default form submission and handle the user's inputs.\n   - Ajax or fetch API can be used to send the user's data to your server and then:\n     - Redirect the user to another page with the search results (traditional approach)\n     - Return the search results as a JSON object and display them inside the widget (modern approach)\n\n5. **Create a CDN-hosted version**:\n   - Upload your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like jsDelivr or unpkg.\n   - Get the public URL for each file.\n\n6. **Create an iframe embed code**:\n   - Include the CDN-hosted HTML file in an iframe. Make sure to adjust the height and width as necessary.\n   - Add JavaScript to the iframe container to handle communication between the widget and the parent application (if needed).\n\n7. **Share the widget**:\n   - Publish your widget by providing the iframe embed code or its URL to users who wish to use it in their applications.\n   - Make sure to include documentation and usage information with your widget to help other developers integrate it correctly.\n\nHere's an example of the iframe embed code:\n\n```html\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/your-widget/1.0.0/widget.html\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n```\n\nRemember that this guide only covers the basics, and you might face additional requirements or challenges while creating the widget, depending on your specific use case.

It was an additive positional system that used two symbols, a dot for one, a horizontal bar for five, and a cowry shell for a place holder (it is unclear whether they also considered it a true numeric zero).\" This information indicates that the Maya used a base-20 number system, which is a mixed base system that combines the use of both decimal and quinary (base-5) components. The use of this mixed base system facilitated the recording of high numbers, as the Maya could represent numbers up to 19 using a single symbol (a combination of dots or bars). However, for numbers greater than 19, they used a bar and placed a cowry shell (or sometimes a dot) above it to signify that the bar represented five additional units [[2](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/when-a-number-system-loses-uniqueness-the-case-of-the-maya-the-mayan-number-system)].\n\nIn addition to the results provided, it's also worth noting that the Mayan number system is known for its use of a unique positional value, where the position of a symbol in the numeral affected its value. This feature allowed for the representation of large numbers in a more compact and manageable way, especially when recording dates or counting significant historical events [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_numerals)].\n\nAnother interesting aspect of the Maya's mixed base system is the use of the concept of zero. While the Maya did not have a distinct symbol for zero similar to that in our modern decimal system, they did have a placeholder, the cowry shell, which represented an empty position in their numeral system [[2](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/when-a-number-system-loses-uniqueness-the-case-of-the-maya-the-mayan-number-system)]. This placeholder was crucial in their positional notation, as it allowed them to write numbers larger than their base value of 20.\n\nThe Maya also used different calendars, namely the haab and the tzolkin, which used their base-20 system [[4](https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/how-the-maya-created-their-extraordinarily-accurate-calendar-thousands-of)]. The tzolkin in particular, was a calendar of 260 days, with each day having a unique combination of thirteen numbers from 1 to 13 and twenty day names. This calendar was significant for the Mayan priests in predicting astronomical events and performing divination rituals [[7](https://quizlet.com/193554283/7th-tci-chp-22-quiz-the-mayas-flash-cards/)].\n\nIt's not explicitly stated in the provided sources if the Maya used a zigzag to count 5s (Search Query), but it's plausible to consider that the pattern of bars (up to four) and their replacement with a dot and an increase in the previous level's symbol could potentially resemble a zigzag pattern.\n\nFurther Research Modules and Search Queries can explore the specific use of the Maya's mixed base system in astronomical calculation, divination rituals, and their overall impact on the development of high-number mathematics and algebra in the Maya civilization.\n\nResearch Questions that branch from this Research Module and Search Query could be:\n- How did the Maya's mixed base number system influence the development of their calculations for astronomy and astrology?\n- How did the Mayan zero (or placeholder) contribute to the expansion of their number system to represent larger numbers more efficiently?\n- What role did the Mayan Calendar (haab and tzolkin) play in the development of their high-number mathematics and algebra?\n- How did the Maya's mixed base system compare to those used by other ancient civilizations, such as the Babylonians or Romans?\n\nAdditional Search Queries:\n- Maya astronomical calculations\n- Maya divination rituals\n- Mayan Calendar in detail\n- Maya number system and algebra\n- Comparison of Mayan, Babylonian, and Roman number systems.", "shortest_response": "The most relevant result to the Research Question can be found in [2], which discusses the Mayan number system. The Mayan culture used a base 20 number system, which was an additive positional system that used two symbols: a dot for one, a horizontal bar for five.

It's worth noting that the Maya did not use a distinct symbol for zero like we do in our decimal system. Instead, they used a 'blank' space to denote the absence of a number in a position in their number system [[3](https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n1i336p03)].\n\nThe Mayan number system, while a base 20 system, is not purely base 20. When adding numbers, if five or more dots result from the combination, five dots are removed and replaced by a bar [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_numerals)]. This suggests an underlying binary (base 2) understanding when handling groups of 5.\n\nAn interesting point to ponder would be if the Maya used a zigzag pattern to count fives, as suggested in the search query. However, there's no concrete evidence to support this in the provided results. Further research could be conducted on Mayan number patterns and symbolism to investigate this possibility.\n\nA potential new research question could be: Did the Maya use any pattern or notation, other than their number system, to represent groups of five or handle larger numbers more efficiently?\n\nFor further research, it would be beneficial to study the mathematics and number systems of other civilizations, such as the Babylonians or the Egyptians, to compare and contrast their approaches to high number mathematics, particularly in relation to the use of mixed base systems.\n\nA new research question could be: How did the Babylonians or Egyptians handle high numbers in their mixed base systems, and what insights can be gained from comparing these approaches to that of the Maya?", "input_size": 1492, "output_sizes": [1009, 516, 966, 837, 557, 886, 726, 794, 949, 693], "output_mean": 793.3, "output_std": 160.75, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 701.25, "p50": 815.5, "p75": 933.25, "p99": 1005.13}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 44.59714}, {"sample_id": "7ed62a9f7b076dec", "prompt_id": "f53947eb643b9249", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "make it more formal cause there will be chairman vicechairman and other person as a guest", "longest_response": "Subject: Formal Invitation for an Exclusive Event\n\nDear Esteemed Guests,\n\nIt is with immense pleasure that we extend a warm and cordial invitation to you on behalf of our esteemed organization for an exceptional event that we have planned meticulously.

Use the following command to install it:\n\n   ```\n   gcloud components install gsutil\n   ```\n\n   To start using Google Cloud Storage, initialize the Cloud SDK:\n\n   ```\n   gcloud init\n   ```\n\n2. **Uploading microscopy images to Google Cloud Storage:**\n   Use the `gsutil cp` command to upload your microscopy images to Google Cloud Storage:\n\n   ```\n   gsutil cp path/to/your/image.tif gs://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/\n   ```\n\n   Replace `path/to/your/image.tif` with the actual path to the image file you want to upload, and `gs://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/` with the name of your Google Cloud Storage bucket.\n\n3. **Reading large images from Google Cloud Storage:**\n   To read large images from Google Cloud Storage, you can create a custom function to manage reading and caching of images. Here's a simple example:\n\n   ```python\n   import io\n   from google.cloud import storage\n\n   def read_image_from_gcs(bucket_name, source_blob_name, cache_dir='.'):\n       \"\"\"Reads the contents of a blob from the given bucket.\"\"\"\n       from google.cloud import storage\n\n       client = storage.Client()\n       bucket = client.get_bucket(bucket_name)\n       blob = bucket.blob(source_blob_name)\n\n       if blob.exists():\n           print('Image {} exists.'.format(blob.name))\n           cache_path = '{}/{}_{}'.format(cache_dir, blob.name, 'tif')\n           if not blob.content:\n               print('Image is empty, skipping.')\n               return None\n           if not blob.content.get_size():\n               print('Image has zero size, skipping.')\n               return None\n           if not os.path.isdir(cache_dir):\n               os.makedirs(cache_dir, exist_ok=True)\n\n           # Read the image data from Cloud Storage\n           response = blob.download_to_file(cache_path)\n           img = imageio.imread(cache_path)\n\n           print('Image {} successfully read.'.format(blob.name))\n           return img\n       else:\n           print('Image {} does not exist.'.format(blob.name))\n           return None\n   ```\n\n   This function downloads the image from Cloud Storage, cache it locally, and returns the image using the `imageio` library for reading the image data.\n\n4. **Analyzing images using Google Cloud AI Platform:**\n   Google Cloud AI Platform allows you to train and deploy ML models using TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and more. To analyze the uploaded microscopy images, you can use pre-trained models available on Cloud AI Hub, or train your own custom models using the data.\n\n   Follow these instructions to learn more about using Cloud AI Platform: https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/docs/overview\n\n5. **Visualizing results using Google Colab:**\n   You can use Google Colab to visualize the results of your image analysis without the need for a local installation. Simply upload your analysis results (e.g., predictions, segmented regions) and use Matplotlib, Seaborn, or other libraries for plotting the results.\n\nHere's a simple Jupyter notebook setup for Cloud Colab, which automatically mounts your Google Drive as a folder in the Colab workspace and uploads any required dependencies:\n\n1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/\n2. Click \"File\" -> \"New notebook\"\n3. In the first cell, add the following code to mount your Google Drive:\n\n   ```python\n   from google.colab import drive\n   drive.mount('/content/drive')\n   ```\n\n4. In the next cell, install the required dependencies:\n\n   ```python\n   !pip install google-cloud-storage imageio\n   ```\n\n5. You can now access your Google Drive using `/content/drive/` in your Colab notebook, and proceed with the code for reading, processing, and analyzing the microscopy images.", "shortest_response": "Absolutely! I can help you write some Python code for working with large microscopy images on Google Cloud. Here are some steps and tools you might find useful:\n\n1. **Storing your images:** You'll want to upload your images to Google Cloud Storage. The google-cloud-storage library can be used to manage files in your bucket.\n\n2. **Processing your images:** For image processing tasks like reading, writing, and manipulation, you can use the OpenCV library (`pip install opencv-python` or `pip install opencv-python-headless` if you don't need a GUI). If you need more machine learning capabilities, consider using TensorFlow (`pip install tensorflow`).\n\n3. **Managing large datasets:** For managing very large datasets, you may want to use Google's Dataflow or BigQuery. Dataflow is great for batch and stream processing, while BigQuery is useful for SQL-like data analysis on gigabytes to petabytes of data.\n\nHere's an example of how you can upload images to Google Cloud Storage and read them using OpenCV:\n\n```python\nfrom google.cloud import storage\nimport cv2\n\n# Mount Google Cloud Storage\nstorage_client = storage.Client()\nbucket_name = \"my-bucket\"\nbucket = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket_name)\nblob = bucket.blob(\"image.jpg\")\nblob.download_to_filename(\"image.jpg\")\n\n# Read the uploaded image with OpenCV\nimage = cv2.imread(\"image.jpg\")\n```\n\nRefer to the official Google Cloud Storage and OpenCV Python documentation for more details:\n\n- [Google Cloud Storage documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference/libraries)\n- [OpenCV Python documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d1/df8/tutorial_py_root.html)", "input_size": 51, "output_sizes": [846, 727, 610, 611, 537, 889, 1176, 437, 894, 624], "output_mean": 735.1, "output_std": 206.69, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 610.25, "p50": 675.5, "p75": 878.25, "p99": 1150.62}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 31.01444}, {"sample_id": "dbd9591a8d9d39c9", "prompt_id": "ee24c879b9d8ac64", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "add an assert to the following code to make sure the user logged in by checking that 'logged in' in written on the screen:\n//Example\nimport openqa.selenium.OutputType.\\*;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.\\*;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.\\*;\n\nWDS.sampleResult.sampleStart();\nWDS.browser.get(\"https://ms-dev.vitalwork.com.br/\");\nWDS.browser.manage().window().setSize(new Dimension(1265, 1025));\nWDS.browser.findElement(By.id(\"questionnaire\\_id\")).click();\nWDS.browser.findElement(By.id(\"questionnaire\\_id\")).sendKeys(\"vitalwork2022\");\nWDS.browser.findElement(By.id(\"submit-button\")).click();", "longest_response": "To add an assertion for checking whether the user is logged in, we can look for an element that is unique to the logged-in page. Let's assume that there is a heading or specific text that appears only on the logged-in page. Here's an updated code with an assertion using PageFactory:\n\n```java\nimport org.openqa.selenium.*;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.support.*;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.*;\n\n@PageFactory\npublic class LoginPage {\n    @FindBy(id = \"questionnaire_id\")\n    private WebElement questionnaireID;\n\n    @FindBy(id = \"submit-button\")\n    private WebElement submitButton;\n\n    // Add a WebElement for the login success indicator\n    @FindBy(xpath = \"//*[contains(text(), 'Logged in')]\")\n    private WebElement loggedInText;\n\n    public void performLogin(String questionnaire) {\n        questionnaireID.click();\n        questionnaireID.sendKeys(questionaire);\n        submitButton.click();\n    }\n}\n\nImport LoginPage;\n\npublic class TestVitalwork {\n    private static final WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();\n\n    @Before\n    public void setup() {\n        driver.get(\"https://ms-dev.vitalwork.com.br/\");\n        driver.manage().window().setSize(new Dimension(1265, 1025));\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void testLogin() {\n        WDS.sampleResult.sampleStart();\n        LoginPage loginPage = new LoginPage(driver);\n        loginPage.performLogin(\"vitalwork2022\");\n\n        // Check if the user is logged in (loggedInText is displayed)\n        Assert.assertTrue(loginPage.loggedInText.isDisplayed());\n    }\n\n    @After\n    public void teardown() {\n        if (driver != null) driver.quit();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we created a PageFactory class called `LoginPage` with an XPath expression for the text indicating that the user is logged in. The test method `testLogin` invokes the `performLogin` method on the `LoginPage` object and asserts that the logged-in message is displayed using the `isDisplayed()` method.", "shortest_response": "To add an assertion to check if the user is logged in, you can add code to check if a specific element (e.g., a label or text) is visible on the screen after logging in.

If the text isn't displayed, the test will fail. If the text is displayed, the test will pass. Make sure to replace the `xpath` with a valid locator for the specific element on your webpage.\n\nYou can also add an assertion to verify the user name displayed after logging in, by replacing `'Logged in as user name'` with the expected user name.", "input_size": 209, "output_sizes": [553, 419, 508, 425, 377, 496, 360, 448, 350, 405], "output_mean": 434.1, "output_std": 63.72, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 384.0, "p50": 422.0, "p75": 484.0, "p99": 548.95}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 13.48278}, {"sample_id": "2344b865402d659c", "prompt_id": "f63f493f4418fa13", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Can you give me a summary of the most important points of the book \"The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph\" by Ryan Holiday", "longest_response": "Title: \"The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph\" by Ryan Holiday\n\n1.

Here's an approach that considers the different steps and utilizes ChatGPT to improve the user experience:\n\n1. **Greeting and Intent identification**\nWhen the user initiates the interaction, ChatGPT should greet them, establish the purpose of the conversation, and start identifying the user's current intent based on the messages they send. This can be done using machine learning algorithms and a well-crafted set of rules for understanding user intent.\n\n2. **Asking for location**\nInstead of asking for a zip code, you can make the process more engaging by framing the request in a conversational manner. For example, ChatGPT can ask \"Can you tell me where you're coming from today?\" or \"Let's find out where you're joining us from.\" This approach helps create a more natural and user-friendly dialogue.\n\nTo determine the user's location, there are several strategies you can use:\n\n* **IP Geolocation**: This method uses the IP address of the user's device to estimate their location. While this technique is fast and works in most cases, it may not provide the most accurate results, as IP addresses can be shared by multiple users.\n* **Geolocation through browser settings**: If the user's browser is set to share their location, you can use this information to find their location. Make sure to ask for the user's explicit consent before accessing their location data and comply with relevant privacy regulations.\n* **Manual input**: Allow users to provide their location manually if they prefer or if the above methods fail.\n\n3. **Recommending events**\nOnce the user's location is established, you can use that information to show relevant events in their area. ChatGPT can suggest events based on user preferences, previously attended events, and events currently popular in their location. Users can interact with the suggested events by indicating their interest, selecting a date/time slot, and providing the expected number of guests.\n\n4. **Creating a customer profile**\nTo create a customer profile, ChatGPT can ask users questions related to their preferences, interests, and past purchasing behavior. For example, it can ask users to specify their favorite event types, favorite artists, or which days and times they prefer to attend events. This information can be used to make subsequent recommendations more personalized.\n\n5. **Integrating ChatGPT to create a better user experience**\nChatGPT can be utilized throughout the entire process to improve the user experience by providing:\n\n- **Natural language processing**: ChatGPT can understand and respond to user input using natural language processing techniques, making the conversation feel more human-like and intuitive.\n- **Intelligent recommendations**: With deep learning models and understanding user preferences, ChatGPT can make intelligent and personalized recommendations that are more likely to engage the user.\n- **Personalized dialogue**: By adapting the conversation based on user behavior and preferences, ChatGPT can create a more tailored experience for each user, making them more likely to engage and return.\n- **Proactive assistance**: ChatGPT can anticipate user needs and provide helpful suggestions or answer questions proactively, reducing the overall effort required from users and enhancing their overall experience.\n\nOverall, by integrating ChatGPT into your e-commerce shopping experience, you can create a more engaging, personalized, and streamlined process for users to find, select, and purchase event tickets with ease.", "shortest_response": "To integrate a text-based conversational shopping experience using ChatGPT for an e-commerce website, you can follow the steps below:\n\n1. **Location identification**: Instead of asking for the zip code, consider using a text-based approach where users can enter their city, state, or address. You can use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the location details from their input. You can also incorporate NLP to understand if users are providing landmarks or popular points of interest to determine their location.\n\n2. **Location-based event recommendations**: Using the provided location, you can integrate ChatGPT or any similar text-based conversational AI to provide personalized event recommendations based on local events, activities, and store offerings. This will make the recommendations more engaging and relevant to users.\n\n3. **Date, time, and guest selection**: Allow users to interact with ChatGMT to select a date, time, and number of guests for the event they have chosen. ChatGPT can help guide users through the selection process, offering suggestions and handling potential errors or ambiguities in the user's input.\n\n4. **Creating a customer profile**: While interacting with ChatGPT, users can provide additional information such as their name, contact details, and interests. This information will be used to create a comprehensive customer profile for future marketing and personalization efforts.\n\n5. **Integrating ChatGPT for a better user experience**: By making the user interaction text-based, you can create a more engaging and seamless experience. ChatGPT can handle complex queries, learn from user behavior, and respond accordingly, making the interaction feel more human-like. Additionally, ChatGPT can offer personalized recommendations and handle errors gracefully, making the process more enjoyable for users.\n\n6. **Ongoing conversation**: Allow ChatGPT to continue the conversation to answer any additional questions users may have, provide further recommendations, or offer support during the purchasing process.

Here's a step-by-step guide using the `react-youtube` library, which is a simple wrapper around the official YouTube player API. Later, we'll also add a vaporwave aesthetic.\n\nFirst, let's install the required dependencies:\n\n```\nnpm install react-youtube styled-components framer-motion\n```\n\nNow, create a new component `VaporwaveVideoPlayer.tsx` and implement the video player:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { StyledPlayer, Player, Video, Controls } from './styles';\nimport { YouTubePlayer } from 'react-youtube';\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion';\n\nconst VaporwaveVideoPlayer: React.FC<{ videoId: string }> = ({ videoId }) => {\n  const playerConfig = {\n    height: '100%',\n    width: '100%',\n    playerVars: {\n      autoplay: 1,\n      controls: 0,\n      cc_load_policy: 0,\n      disablekb: 1,\n      rel: 0,\n      modestbranding: 1,\n      fs: 0,\n      iv_load_policy: 3,\n      loop: 1,\n      playlist: videoId,\n      autohide: 1,\n    },\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <StyledPlayer>\n      <Player>\n        <YouTubePlayer videoId={videoId} opts={playerConfig} />\n      </Player>\n      <Controls>\n        {/* Add custom controls if needed */}\n      </Controls>\n    </StyledPlayer>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default VaporwaveVideoPlayer;\n```\n\nNext, create the styling for the components. Create a new folder `styles` inside the `components` folder and create files for each component:\n\n- `Player.tsx`:\n\n```tsx\nimport styled from 'styled-components';\nimport { CSSObject } from 'styled-components';\n\nexport const Player = styled.div`\n  position: relative;\n  padding-bottom: 56.25%;\n  height: 0;\n  overflow: hidden;\n`;\n```\n\n- `Video.tsx`:\n\n```tsx\nimport { CSSObject } from 'styled-components';\n\nexport const Video = styled.div<{ position: CSSObject }>`\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n`;\n```\n\n- `Controls.tsx`:\n\n```tsx\nimport { CSSObject } from 'styled-components';\n\nexport const Controls = styled.div`\n  position: absolute;\n  bottom: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  height: 50px;\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n`;\n```\n\n- Finally, create a `StyledPlayer.tsx`:\n\n```tsx\nimport styled from 'styled-components';\n\nexport const StyledPlayer = styled(motion.div)`\n  ${({ theme }) => theme.vaporwave}\n  height: 100%;\n  width: 100%;\n  position: fixed;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  z-index: 1;\n`;\n```\n\nNow, to add the vaporwave aesthetic, first, you need to set up the theme in your Next.js project. You can follow a guide such as [this](https://www.figma.com/community/tutorial/10385) to create a vaporwave theme and use it with [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) by creating a `theme.ts` file in the root directory of your Next.js project.\n\nFinally, use the created `StyledPlayer` component and apply the vaporwave theme to it.

Method\nOur approach builds on data2vec (Baevski et al., 2022) and\nwe first describe the major shared techniques including pre\u0002dicting contextualized target representations (\u00a73.1). Similar\nto Masked Autoencoders (MAE; He et al. 2021), we encode\nonly non-masked portions of a sample and use a decoder\nmodel to predict target representations for the masked por\u0002tions but instead of using a Transformer-based decoder, we\nuse a smaller convolutional decoder which we find to be eas\u0002ier and faster to train (\u00a73.2). To amortize the computational\noverhead of creating contextualized target representations,\nwe reuse each target for multiple masked versions of a train\u0002ing sample (\u00a73.3) and instead of random masking or block\nmasking, our inverse block masking strategy ensures that\ncontiguous regions of the sample are preserved to provide\nmore context for student predictions (\u00a73.4).\n3.1. Contextualized Target Prediction\nInstead of reconstructing local windows of the the raw input\ndata (He et al., 2021), or predicting discrete representations\nthereof (Bao et al., 2021), we predict representations of the\nteacher network incorporating information from the entire\ninput sample. This leads to a richer training task where\ntargets are specific to a particular training sample. Contex\u0002tualized targets are built via the self-attention mechanism\nof a Transformer-based teacher model which encodes the\nunmasked training sample (Paulus et al., 2017; Vaswani\net al., 2017) and the training targets are a weighted sum of\nall features in the sample.\nTarget Representations and Learning Objective. Train\u0002ing targets are based on averaging the top K FFN blocks\nof the teacher. Before averaging, activations are normal\u0002ized using instance normalization (Ulyanov et al., 2016).1\nThe training task is for the student network to regress these\ntargets based on the masked version of the sample.\nTeacher Weights. The teacher weights \u2206 are an expo\u0002nentially moving average of the student encoder weights \u03b8\n(Grill et al., 2020): \u2206 \u2190 \u03c4\u2206 + (1 \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u03b8 where \u03c4 follows\n1Layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) of the averaged targets\ncan be useful for some modalities such as speech and vision.\na linearly increasing schedule from a starting value \u03c40 to a\nfinal value \u03c4e over \u03c4n updates, after which the value is kept\nconstant (Baevski et al., 2022).\nLearning Objective. We use an L2 loss based on the\ntarget representation from the teacher network y and the\nstudent network prediction f(x). This is a simplification\ncompared to the Smooth L1 loss used in Baevski et al. (2022)\nand we found it to work well across modalities.\n3.2. Model Architecture\nSimilar to data2vec (Baevski et al., 2022), our model uses\nmodality-specific feature encoders and a Transformer archi\u0002tecture where the latter makes up the the bulk of the model\nweights (Vaswani et al., 2017). For computer vision, we use\na patch mapping of 16x16 pixels as feature encoder (Doso\u0002vitskiy et al., 2020), for speech a multi-layer convolutional\nnetwork following van den Oord et al. (2018); Baevski et al.\n(2020b; 2022) and for text we use embeddings learned based\non byte-pair encoding (Sennrich et al., 2016).\nAsymmetric Encoder/Decoder Architecture. In a first\nstep, we use the teacher network to encode all parts of the\nunmasked training sample in order to create training targets\n(\u00a73.1). Next, we mask part of the sample (\u00a73.4) and em\u0002bed it with the student encoder. To improve efficiency, we\nencode only unmasked patches or time-steps of a training\nexample which leads to a large speed-up compared to encod\u0002ing all parts of the sample (He et al., 2021), depending on\nthe amount of masking. The output of the student encoder is\nthen merged with fixed representations for the masked por\u0002tions and fed to a decoder network. To represent the masked\ntokens, we found it sufficient to use random Gaussian noise\ncompared to a learned representation (He et al., 2021).2 The\ndecoder network then reconstructs the contextualized target\nrepresentation of the teacher network for time-steps which\nare masked in the student input.\nConvolutional Decoder Network. We use a lightweight\ndecoder consisting of D convolutions, each followed by\nlayer normalization (Ba et al., 2016), a GELU activation\nfunction (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016), and a residual con\u0002nection (He et al., 2015). For sequential data such as speech\nand text we use 1-D convolutions and for images we use\n2-D convolutions, each parameterized by groups to increase\nefficiency (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). We tune the number of\nlayers and kernel size for each modality.\n2We also experimented with adding positional embeddings but\nfound that they do not improve results.\nEfficient Self-supervised Learning with Contextualized Target Representations for Vision, Speech and Language\n3.3. Multi-mask Training\nA disadvantage of the data2vec teacher-student setup is the\nneed to process each sample twice: once to obtain targets\nwith the teacher model, and once to obtain predictions of\nthe student. Moreover, computing activations for the teacher\nmodel is also less efficient compared to the student model\nsince the teacher needs to process the full unmasked input.3\nIn order to amortize the cost of the teacher model com\u0002putation, we reuse the teacher representation for multiple\nmasked versions of the training sample. Concretely, we con\u0002sider M different masked versions of the training sample\nand compute the loss with respect to the same target repre\u0002sentation. This is possible, because target representations\nare based on the full unmasked version of the sample. As\nM grows, the computational overhead of computing target\nrepresentations becomes negligible. In practice, this enables\ntraining with a relatively small batch size compared to other\nself-supervised work (\u00a74).\nConsidering multiple masked versions of a training sam\u0002ple has been previously explored in the context of self\u0002supervised learning for computer vision with ResNet mod\u0002els (Jing et al., 2022), although the authors found that it\nperformed much less well than different image augmenta\u0002tions. Caron et al. (2020a) considers multiple crops based\non the same image but trains the model by comparing dis\u0002crete codes rather than predicting the representation of the\noriginal image. And Girdhar et al. (2022) trains MAE mod\u0002els on videos with multiple masked versions of a sample to\namortize the overhead of data loading and preparation.\nAnother efficiency improvement of data2vec 2.0 compared\nto data2vec is to share the feature encoder output across the\ndifferent masked versions of the training example to avoid\nredundant computation. This leads to significant speed\u0002ups for dense modalities such as speech where the feature\nencoder accounts for a large portion of the computation but\nless so for other modalities such as text.\n3.4. Inverse Block Masking\nThe MAE-style sample encoding improves efficiency but\nalso removes the ability to store information in the acti\u0002vations of masked time-steps which makes the training\ntask more challenging. Random masking is successful for\nMasked Autoencoders (He et al., 2021) but it may interfere\nwith the ability to build semantic representations since there\nis no structure in the masks that are created. Block mask\u0002ing (Bao et al., 2021) is more structured by masking entire\nblocks of time-steps or patches but there is no guarantee\nthat large contiguous portions of the training sample are\nunmasked. Our goal is to enable the student model to build\n3Baevski et al. (2022) found it important to build targets based\non the unmasked sample rather than another masked version.\nsemantically rich representations over local regions of the\nsample.\nWe therefore introduce inverse block masking: instead of\nchoosing which patches to mask, it chooses which patches\nto preserve in a block-wise fashion, where the size of a block\nis in terms of the number of patches or time-steps B. We\nfirst sample the starting point of each block to keep, and\nthen expand it symmetrically until the block is of width B,\nfor speech and text, or \u221a\nB for images.4 We sample the\nfollowing number of starting points without replacement\nand expand them to width\n\u221a\nB or quadratic blocks of width\nB, depending on the modality:\nL \u00d7\n(1 \u2212 R) + A\nB\nwhere L is the total number of time-steps/patches in a train\u0002ing sample, R is the mask ratio, a hyper parameter control\u0002ling the percentage of the sample that is masked and A is a\nhyper-parameter to adjust mask ratio (see below).\nWe allow blocks to overlap, which results in over-masking\nand some variance in the number of actually masked time\u0002steps for each sample.

Digital filmmaking now enables anyone to make films.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Do you think this is a positive or negative development?", "longest_response": "Title: The Cinematic Revolution: The Tide Turning Towards Inclusive Storytelling\n\nIn an era where the barrier to cinematic creation has plummeted, the democratization of filmmaking is no longer a distant dream, but a tangible reality. This seismic shift, while not universally hailed, is an undeniable boon for our cultural landscape, transcending the boundaries of traditional production powerhouses and championing the cause of diverse voices.\n\nOnce ensconced within the confines of large studios, the power of filmmaking was wielded by a select few. Yet, in an age fueled by digital innovation, the once inviolable walls have crumbled, granting access to the unparalleled creativity that simmers within the hearts of the masses. This newfound liberty presents an unprecedented opportunity for untold stories to see the light of day, thereby enriching our collective narrative and illuminating the tapestry of human experiences.\n\nHowever, like any sea change, the digital filmmaking revolution is not without its critics. Worries abound that the influx of inexperienced filmmakers could dilute the quality of cinematic output, threatening the sanctity of the art form. But it is essential to remember that every great artist, at one point, was a novice honing their craft. The crucible of trial and error gives birth to mastery, and as more individuals stake their claim in this burgeoning domain, the collective pool of knowledge expands, fostering growth and progress.\n\nMoreover, the proliferation of accessible filmmaking tools has the potential to bring forth a new golden age of diversity in storytelling. For too long, underrepresented voices have been consigned to the margins, their tales drowned out by those of the privileged few. But with digital technology democratizing the cinematic process, the stage is set for the most vibrant and diverse array of narratives to take center stage. In the words of Zora Neale Hurston, \"If you are silent about your pain, they'll kill you and say you enjoyed it.\" Through the lens of the digital filmmaking revolution, the voices of the oppressed can finally be heard, bringing us one step closer to a world where each individual's story is valued and celebrated.\n\nIn conclusion, the digital filmmaking revolution, while generating valid apprehensions about quality control, heralds a new era of inclusive and diverse storytelling. By shattering the exclusivity that defined filmmaking for decades, we stand poised to usher in a renaissance of creativity and diversity, ensuring that the stories told on our screens resonate with the myriad experiences that comprise our shared human history. If harnessed wisely, the potential benefits of this revolution could prove invaluable, propelling us towards an empathetic and enlightened future.", "shortest_response": "Title: The Unbounded Canvas: A Renaissance of Self-expression in the Digital Filmmaking Age\n\nIn the grand tapestry of human civilization, evolution is a persistent thread, weaving new narratives with each passing generation. One such revolutionary strand, in our contemporary world, is the democratization of filmmaking, a revolution brought about by the advent of digital technology. No longer confined to the ivory towers of Hollywood, the medium of film is now within the grasp of the masses, ushering in an era of unprecedented creativity and self-expression.\n\nThis development, while not without its critics, is undeniably a beacon of positive transformation. The democratization of filmmaking serves as a catalyst for voices long silenced, ideas unheard, and stories untold. It presents a platform for the diverse tapestry of human experiences to be woven into the global narrative, enriching our collective understanding and empathy.\n\nIn a sense, this trend represents the renaissance of cinema, where each individual is a potential da Vinci, painting a masterpiece on the vast digital canvas. It empowerers millions, breaking down the barriers of access and providing an outlet for artistic expression in the most intimate and universal medium.\n\nCritics argue that this deluge of content may dilute the quality of film, but quality, like art, lies in the eye of the beholder. By providing the tools for self-expression, digital filmmaking has given birth to a new generation of storytellers, each with their unique voices and visions. The wheat will always rise to the top, and in this digital age, the wheat has more opportunities than ever before to shine.\n\nIn conclusion, the rise of digital filmmaking is a positive leap forward, fostering an environment of unparalleled creativity, diversity, and self-expression. Embracing this change, we usher in a new era of storytelling, where the story is no longer told by the few, but by the many.

Please note that recovery times vary and can be affected by numerous factors.\n\n1. Great Depression (1929-1939)\n- Decline: The infamous stock market crash in 1929 led to a massive housing market decline. Housing prices dropped by more than 30%, and construction significantly slowed.\n- Recovery: Housing price recovery took around 20-25 years to reach pre-crash levels in some major cities.\n\n2. Post-World War II Housing Shortage (1945-1950)\n- Decline: Following World War II, there was a significant shortage of housing due to the increased demand from returning veterans and the reallocation of resources to war efforts.\n- Recovery: Construction programs aimed at addressing the housing shortage led to a relatively quick recovery within approximately 5 years.\n\n3. 1970s Stagflation (1970-1975)\n- Decline: A combination of high inflation, slow economic growth, and rising unemployment rates impacted the housing market. During this period, housing starts dropped by more than 40%.\n- Recovery: The Federal Reserve's tight monetary policy helped combat inflation, which led to a strengthening economy and improved housing market conditions. Recovery took roughly 5-7 years.\n\n4. Savings and Loan Crisis (mid-1980s)\n- Decline: Regulatory failings and risky lending practices led to the failure of thousands of savings and loan associations, causing a crisis in the housing market. Foreclosures rose, and housing prices declined.\n- Recovery: The Clean Up of the Savings and Loan Industry Act of 1989 helped to address the crisis. Recovery times varied but generally took 8-10 years.\n\n5. Dot-Com Bubble and 9/11 (2000-2002)\n- Decline: The bursting of the Dot-Com bubble and the 9/11 attacks led to economic uncertainty and housing market volatility. Housing prices started to decline in 2000 and remained weak until 2002.\n- Recovery: Recovery began in 2003 and took roughly 4-5 years to return to pre-recession levels in some areas.\n\n6. Great Recession (2007-2012)\n- Decline: A collapse in the housing market precipitated by unsustainable mortgage-backed securities and lax lending practices led to widespread foreclosures, a housing market collapse, and a global financial crisis. Housing prices bottomed in 2012.\n- Recovery: Housing market recovery was slow, particularly in areas most affected by the financial crisis.

However, it's important to note that the exact length of recovery can vary, and the following information serves as a general guide:\n\n1. Great Depression (1929-1933): During this time, the housing market collapsed, followed by a slow and gradual recovery. Homes took approximately 20 years to reach pre-Depression highs.\n\n2. Post-World War II Slump (early 1940s - mid 1940s): A temporary dip in housing prices after World War II due to demobilization and transitioning civilian workers. Recovery took around 5 years.\n\n3. Oil Crisis and Stagflation (1973 - mid 1970s): Home prices experienced a decline following the oil crisis and subsequent economic downturn, with recovery taking around 5-7 years.\n\n4. Savings & Loan Crisis (1980s - early 1990s): This prolonged housing crisis arose from failures in the savings and loan industry, resulting in a decrease in housing prices. Recovery ranged from 6-10 years.\n\n5. Dot-Com Boom & Bust (early 2000s): The technology-driven stock market crash affected the broader economy, leading to a short-lived housing market decline.

Anchoring: Instead of starting a negotiation with an unrealistic demand, set an initial position that is reasonable yet still favorable to your needs. For example, \"I'd like to discuss the terms of the project, and my initial stance is a budget of $5000. However, I'm open to hearing your perspective as well.\"\n\n2. Calibrated Questions: Ask open-ended questions to gather information and understand the other party's needs, wants, and priorities. For example, \"Can you help me understand why a budget below $4000 would not work for this project?\" or \"What are the main factors that drove you to propose a budget of $6000?\"\n\n3. Mirroring: Rephrase the last few words or sentences the other party said to show empathy and demonstrate active listening. For example, \"[Partner's Name], from what I hear, you believe we need to agree on a budget that reflects the project's complexity while keeping costs under control. Is that correct?\"\n\n4. Accusation Audit: Identify and address negative emotions or criticism by acknowledging them and asking the other party to provide specific examples of their concerns. For example, \"I understand you're frustrated about the missed deadline. Can you clarify what exactly happened, and how it affected our progress?\"\n\n5. Labeling: Label the other party's emotions to defuse tense situations and encourage them to share their feelings. For example, \"I can tell you're feeling upset about the delay. Let's discuss a fair resolution that meets both our needs.\"\n\n6. Basing: Instead of debating conflicting claims, focus on finding common ground by identifying shared values or interests. For example, \"We both want to ensure the success of this project. What can we do to collaborate and reach our common goal?\"\n\n7. Collaborative Statements: Use \"we\" instead of \"I\" to create a sense of teamwork and promote a win-win outcome. For example, \"Let's work together to find a reasonable budget for the project without compromising quality.\"\n\n8. Silent Period: Pause and allow the other party to respond after a question or statement. Sometimes, letting them think about the information will lead to more productive conversations. For example, \"I value your input, and I'd like to hear your thoughts on our potential solutions.\"\n\n9. Probing: Use questions to draw out the other party's priorities, preferences, and flexibility. For example, \"If we can't meet your budget expectations, what are some other areas where we can find cost savings?\" or \"What concessions are you willing to make to reach an agreement?\"\n\n10. Attentive Listening: Show empathy, understanding, and a genuine interest in the other party's perspective by active listening, questioning, and paraphrasing their statements. For example, \"From what I understand, you're concerned about the timeline for the project. I share your desire to complete it on schedule. Can we discuss some potential tactics to expedite the process while maintaining quality?\"\n\nBy incorporating these negotiation strategies from \"Never Split the Difference\" into your questions, you can foster more productive, collaborative, and successful negotiations.", "shortest_response": "Absolutely!

Ads will be served to Microsoft Store users on Windows 10 and Windows 11 and are only available to developers who have already published their apps to the store.\n\nThese kinds of ads are usually described in benign terms\u2014that they're merely a way for the developers on the Microsoft Store to boost their work and find more users. The reality is that similar ads on Apple's platforms, at least in my experience, tend to be either irrelevant (ads for Twitter or Truth Social on a search for Mastodon clients), annoying (ads for shovelware free-to-play games), actively malicious (the brief period where gambling ads took over the store), or some combination of all three.\n\nThe new addition may or may not turn up relevant search results for users, but it does add more advertisements to a platform that already has plenty of them. A fresh Windows 11 install from a USB stick automatically pulls down a range of third-party apps from the Microsoft Store the first time you connect to the Internet, and Windows includes plenty of Microsoft house ads for Edge, Bing, Microsoft Start, Microsoft 365, OneDrive, and other products and features.\nMicrosoft's landing page for the feature says the apps will appear during searches and in the Apps and Gaming tabs within the app. Developers will be able to track whether and where users see the ads and whether they're downloading and opening the apps once they see the ads.\n\nReach the right customers at the right time with your games and apps\nContent is at the heart of the Windows PC experience. Consumers typically visit the Microsoft Store to learn more about a wide variety of PC apps or games, from productivity apps that accelerate work to creativity apps that empower innovation, games that incentivize connection, and more. Because most consumers live a multi-screen life\u2014moving from smartphones to PCs and back again\u2014the lines between \u201cmobile\u201d and \u201cdesktop\u201d have blurred. In turn, the behaviors consumers are accustomed to on mobile are transferable to the way people expect apps on PCs to look, feel, and function. Developers know that apps are central to how we work, play, and connect. And the great news is PC apps are having their moment. From the pandemic accelerating PC use to app-savvy millennial and Gen-Z audiences growing up creating and using apps\u2014a wide audience is looking for app-centric experiences, not only on mobile, but on PCs, too.\n\nReach a wider app audience with Microsoft Store Ads\n\nOur passion for helping developers more easily bring their apps to customers inspired us to redesign the Microsoft Store on Windows\u2014which now features a new desktop app distribution experience that looks and feels more like mobile.

A developer of a music-making app, for example, will be able to create an ad campaign to get their app in front of an audience that likes music or likes to create music.\n\nWhether you\u2019re about to launch a brand-new app or have a 2.0 bug update for an app currently on the Windows Store, developers can now advertise right on the Microsoft Store, to incentivize people to install or update.\n\nAll developers are welcome\nWe are now offering a new set of Open App Store Principles that welcome all developers to bring the best apps and games to Windows 11 devices, from apps using their own commerce to third-party storefronts. And last year, we announced a waitlist program for Win32 apps in Microsoft Store and welcomed hundreds of developers. Today, we are pleased to share that the program is now open to all Win32 developers (.NET, C++, Electron, Flutter, Qt, Rust, and more). If your app or game is not in the Microsoft Store yet, begin by publishing your Windows app.\n\nAll developers have access to Microsoft Store Ads, where they can create ad campaigns in the Microsoft Store, using Microsoft Advertising, reaching customers on Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices.

Heschel, a renowned 20th-century scholar, beautifully interpreted the involvement of every Israelite in the Mishkan's construction as the manifestation of G-d's desire for unity among His people. In the words of Rabbi Heschel, \"The Mishkan represented not only G-d's presence among the Israelites, but also the unity of Israel before G-d.\"\n\nThis concept is further emphasized in the Torah's description of the Israelites' contributions to the Mishkan. All Jews, regardless of wealth, social status, or profession, donated generously and willingly. The Torah states in Exodus 35:22, \"\u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05bc\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05e9\u05c2\u05a3\u05d5\u05bc \u05db\u05b9\u0594\u05dc \u05d0\u05b2\u05e9\u05c1\u05b6\u05a5\u05e8 \u05e0\u05b6\u05d0\u05b1\u05d3\u05b8\u0596\u05e8\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05d4 \u05dc\u05b9\u05a3\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d7\u05b5tz \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea\u05be\u05e0\u05b6\u05d3\u05b6\u0591\u05d1\u05b7\u05ea \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea\u05be\u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05e6\u05bc\u05b8\u05a8\u05d4\u05bc \u05d5\u05b0\u05d0\u05b6\u05ea\u05be\u05d0\u05b7\u05e9\u05c1\u05bc\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u059c\u05d4\u05bc \u05d5\u05b0\u05d0\u05b6\u05ea\u05be\u05db\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05be\u05d0\u05b2\u05e9\u05c1\u05b6\u05a3\u05e8 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b8\u0597\u05d4\u05bc \u05d5\u05b0\u05e2\u05b8\u05e9\u05c2\u05a8\u05d5\u05bc \u05db\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05be\u05d0\u05b6\u05a4\u059c\u05d4\u05b0\u05d1\u05b9\u05d5\u05e9\u05c1\u0597\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d4\u05b7\u05e0\u05bc\u05b8\u05ea\u05bd\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\" (Translation: \"And they came every man whose heart stirred him, and every one whose spirit made him willing, and brought the Lord's contribution for the work of the Tent of Meeting, and for all its service, and for the sacred garments.\").\n\nThe Torah shows that G-d's presence was not solely contained within the Mishkan, but rather extended to the very heart and soul of each Israelite. The Mishkan, constructed with the collective effort of the entire nation, symbolized the Jewish people's unified connection to G-d.\n\nToday, we find ourselves in a modern-day desert, wandering and seek G-d's presence amidst ever-changing landscapes. The message from Parshat Vayakhel resonates deeply, reminding us that we too can feel intimately connected to G-d and to our fellow Jews by participating in and contributing positively to our communities. May we always strive to embody, like our ancestors, the qualities of kindness, wisdom, and unity found in the construction of the Mishkan.\n\nShabbat Shalom!", "shortest_response": "Title: \"Unity in Diversity: A Lesson from Vayakhel\"\n\nParshat Vayakhel, in this week's Torah reading, highlights the intricate details of the construction of the Mishkan (Sanctuary). It serves as a reminder of the Israelites' collective devotion and unity in erecting a physical symbol of their connection with God.\n\nAs we read about the various materials and skills involved in the Mishkan's construction, we are struck by the diversity among the contributors. Each individual brought their unique talents - from the carvers and embroiderers to the goldsmiths and construction workers - all unified by their shared purpose and dedication.\n\nThe Mishkan thus stands as a metaphor for the ideal Jewish community. It illustrates that unity is not about homogenizing diversity, but rather, it is about finding common ground despite our differences. Each person brings their own skills, perspectives, and strengths, creating a rich tapestry of community life.\n\nIn our modern world, we can draw a parallel from the Mishkan to our own communities. We are all unique and bring different talents, backgrounds, and beliefs to the table. However, just like the construction of the Mishkan, it is our shared commitment to our collective goals and values that creates a strong, dynamic, and resilient community.\n\nLet us strive to emulate the unity displayed in the Mishkan, celebrating our differences while working together towards the betterment of ourselves, our communities, and the world at large.", "input_size": 17, "output_sizes": [839, 579, 579, 518, 758, 336, 1019, 487, 561, 521], "output_mean": 619.7, "output_std": 187.51, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 518.75, "p50": 570.0, "p75": 713.25, "p99": 1002.8}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 25.49146}, {"sample_id": "634706fe4f9fb6ea", "prompt_id": "29aa2d4085970ad9", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Does my login function below have any lockout functionality?\n\nfrom django.contrib.auth import get\\_user\\_model\nfrom rest\\_framework import permissions, viewsets, filters, status, generics, views\nfrom apps.users.serializers import \\*\nfrom rest\\_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated, AllowAny\nfrom rest\\_framework\\_simplejwt.views import TokenObtainPairView, TokenRefreshView\nfrom rest\\_framework\\_simplejwt.tokens import RefreshToken\nfrom rest\\_framework\\_simplejwt.exceptions import TokenError, InvalidToken\nfrom rest\\_framework.response import Response\nfrom django.shortcuts import redirect\nfrom django.contrib.sites.shortcuts import get\\_current\\_site\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.core.mail import EmailMessage\nfrom django.utils.http import urlsafe\\_base64\\_encode, urlsafe\\_base64\\_decode\nfrom django.contrib.sites.shortcuts import get\\_current\\_site\nfrom django.urls import reverse\\_lazy\nfrom django.contrib.auth.tokens import PasswordResetTokenGenerator\nfrom django.utils.encoding import force\\_bytes, force\\_str\nfrom .models import Document\nfrom rest\\_framework.parsers import MultiPartParser, FormParser\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseNotFound\nfrom django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied\nfrom apps.help\\_requests.models import HelpRequest\nfrom .permissions import DocumentPermission\nclass UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):\n \"\"\"ViewSet for viewing user instances\"\"\"\n\n http\\_method\\_names = ['get']\n serializer\\_class = UserSerializer\n permission\\_classes = (IsAuthenticated,)\n\n def get\\_queryset(self):\n if self.request.user.is\\_superuser: # Admin users can see info of every user\n return get\\_user\\_model().objects.all()\n else:\n # Normal users only see information about themselves\n return get\\_user\\_model().objects.filter(pk=self.request.user.id)\nclass RegistrationViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet, TokenObtainPairView):\n \"\"\"ViewSet for registering new users\"\"\"\n serializer\\_class = RegisterSerializer\n permission\\_classes = (AllowAny,)\n http\\_method\\_names = ['post']\n\n def create(self, request, \\*args, \\*\\*kwargs):\n serializer = self.get\\_serializer(data=request.data)\n\n serializer.is\\_valid(raise\\_exception=True)\n user = serializer.save()\n # Create refresh token for user using simplejwt\n refresh = RefreshToken.for\\_user(user)\n res = {\n \"refresh\": str(refresh),\n \"access\": str(refresh.access\\_token),\n }\n\n return Response({\n \"user\": serializer.data,\n \"refresh\": res[\"refresh\"],\n \"token\": res[\"access\"]\n }, status=status.HTTP\\_201\\_CREATED)\nclass LoginViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet, TokenObtainPairView):\n \"\"\"ViewSet for logging in users.

Install django-guardian: `pip install django-guardian`\n\n2. Add 'guardian' to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py.\n\n3.

The question suggests a circular causality, where the existence of a chicken is required to lay an egg, and, simultaneously, the existence of an egg is required for a chicken to hatch.\n\nModern scientific explanations attempt to explain the origins of life using natural processes, such as evolution and genetics. In the case of modern-day chickens, the prevailing scientific consensus is that the egg came first, in a biological sense.\n\nThe evolutionary process began with a distinct ancestor, a bird called the Red Junglefowl, which laid eggs. Over millions of years of natural selection, these birds gradually evolved into the versions we commonly recognize as chickens today. This means that the first \"chicken\" was more closely related to the early Red Junglefowl, and the egg that would eventually hatch into it was already being laid by an ancestor of that bird.\n\nSo, to elaborate on the question, if we're asking about specific moments in time, the egg came first, as it was a part of an earlier life form. If we ask about the origin of the species we now refer to as chickens, the answer is still that the egg came first, as it represented the initial genetic material that eventually evolved into what we now recognize as a chicken. However, it is important to note that this explanation is from an evolutionary and scientific perspective, as the question itself is philosophical in nature.", "shortest_response": "This question is a classic conundrum, and the answer is neither conclusive nor based in scientific evidence.

Prepare a working directory:\n   - Create a directory to store the customization files, configuration scripts, and the generated image.\n\n```\nmkdir arch-custom-image\ncd arch-custom-image\n```\n\n5. Create a bootable ISO containing the Arch Linux base system, which you will use as the foundation for building your custom image.\n\n```\nmkarchiso --arch x86_64 -r minimal -o /path/to/output/minimal_x86_64.iso\n```\n\nReplace `/path/to/output` with the desired location for the output ISO on the EC2 instance.\n\n6. Create a root filesystem for your custom image:\n\n```\nmkarchiso --arch x86_64 -r custom -p /path/to/output/minimal_x86_64.iso -o rootfs\n```\n\n7. Customize the root filesystem according to your requirements (e.g., install additional packages, configure NetworkManager, etc.).\n\n8. Create and configure partition tables and filesystems for your custom image:\n\n```\ngenfstab -p -U /mnt/rootfs >> rootfs/etc/fstab\n```\n\n9. Chroot into the root filesystem to continue customizing and performing system setup:\n\n```\nmkdir -p /mnt/ROOT\nmount /dev/xvd* /mnt/ROOT\nmount -o bind /proc /mnt/ROOT/proc\nmount -o bind /sys /mnt/ROOT/sys\nchroot /mnt/ROOT\n```\n\n10.

Here's a general guide using AWS EC2 instances as an example:\n\n1. **Create an AWS EC2 Instance**: Choose an instance type that suits your needs. You'll want enough resources to compile the Arch Linux image.\n\n2. **Install Arch Linux**: You'll start by installing Arch Linux on the instance. You can do this by booting from an Arch Linux live image, and then following the installation guide available on the Arch Linux website.\n\n3. **Install Basic Tools**: Once Arch Linux is installed, you'll need to install tools required for building the image. This includes pacman, base-devel group, and mkinitcpio. You can do this with the following commands:\n\n   ```\n   sudo pacman -Syu\n   sudo pacman -S base base-devel linux linux-headers mkinitcpio\n   ```\n\n4. **Clone the Arch Linux Repository**: You'll need the Arch Linux repo to pull the latest changes. Clone it using git:\n\n   ```\n   git clone https://github.com/archlinux/archlinux-repo.git /usr/share/archlinux-repo\n   ```\n\n5. **Customize and Build the Image**: Now, you can customize your image by modifying the pacman and mkinitcpio hooks. For example, if you want to add a custom kernel, you can modify the `mkinitcpio.conf` file, and then rebuild the initramfs with `sudo mkinitcpio -p linux`.\n\n   After making your changes, you can build your custom Arch Linux image with the following command:\n\n   ```\n   sudo makepkg -c -i\n   ```\n\n   This command will create a .tar.xz file in the current directory, which is your custom Arch Linux image.\n\n6. **Transfer the Image**: After the image is built, you can transfer it to a location of your choice. If you have an S3 bucket, you can use the AWS CLI to upload the file:\n\n   ```\n   aws s3 cp /path/to/your/image s3://your-bucket-name/your-image.tar.xz\n   ```\n\n7. **Cleanup**: Don't forget to clean up your EC2 instance to avoid unnecessary costs.

They struggled to balance their professional and personal lives, finding themselves drawn back to their projects rather than the warmth of their shared home.\n\nDetermined to make it work, they sought counsel from their mentor, Professor Amara. She advised them to establish boundaries and prioritize their relationship over their work. With renewed resolve, they tried again, hoping that this time, they would find harmony.\n\nBut alas, their second attempt was no easier. The tension between their professions and their relationship only intensified, leading to more fights and feelings of resentment. The once unbreakable bond between Mutz and Yannis began to fray, and they found themselves drifting apart.\n\nFeeling the weight of their failure, Mutz and Yannis made a painful decision. They would part ways, focusing on their individual careers and Friendship rather than their relationships. They vowed to maintain their bond, recognizing that their shared past would always be a part of their lives.\n\nIn the end, Mutz and Yannis remained close friends, their collaborations continuing to shape the future of Techopolis. But the love that once bridged their friendship now existed only as a bittersweet memory, a testament to a relationship that, despite its shortcomings, had illuminated the depths of their feelings for each other.\n\nThe story of Mutz and Yannis serves as a reminder that sometimes, even the strongest of bonds can't withstand the challenges of love. But through their struggle, they discovered a deeper respect and understanding for one another, proving that friendship can indeed endure even the most difficult trials.", "input_size": 46, "output_sizes": [631, 942, 723, 1095, 1040, 827, 1391, 551, 852, 676], "output_mean": 872.8, "output_std": 240.08, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 687.75, "p50": 839.5, "p75": 1015.5, "p99": 1364.36}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 38.48319}, {"sample_id": "2ac98a37963fa01c", "prompt_id": "d767091ea81cbb15", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "write a python code to train a CNN model using VGG16 with images taken from folders organized in classes and labelled.

Lack of previous exposure (Heterozygote advantage): Native Americans originated in Asia, and the first settlers crossed the Bering Strait approximately 15,000 years ago. Upon arrival and isolation in the Americas, their gene pool became relatively homogenous. European populations, on the other hand, had a much longer history of interbreeding and migration, leading to genetic diversity. This diversity provided a broader genetic background for natural resistance to various pathogens, a concept known as heterozygote advantage. When Europeans were exposed to diseases new to them, such as malaria and yellow fever, their overall genetic diversity offered some protection. The reverse was true for the Native Americans, who lacked prior exposure and thus had little or no natural genetic immunity.\n\n2. Diet and living conditions: The European explorers and settlers were accustomed to a protein-rich diet, which can help boost the immune system. Additionally, many European cities had established sewage systems, which helped to prevent the spread of diseases like cholera. Native American populations, however, often lived in tight-knit communities with limited access to protein sources and no sanitation systems, making them more susceptible to diseases and their devastating consequences.\n\n3. Lack of immunity to Old World diseases: European diseases such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and malaria were new to the Native American populations, meaning they had no previous contact with these pathogens and thus no natural immunity. When disease carriers arrived from Europe, they easily transmitted these deadly contagions among Native Americans, who had no resistance, leading to high mortality rates.\n\n4. Overworking and malnutrition: In some cases, European explorers might have worked themselves to the point of exhaustion or suffered from malnutrition, leaving them susceptible to disease. However, these factors do not appear to have played a significant role in the wider pattern of disease decimation among Native American populations.\n\n5. Cultural factors: European explorers and settlers often used disease as a tool for conquest, intentionally infecting Native Americans with smallpox-infected blankets and other methods of germ warfare. This malicious practice exacerbated the devastation among the Native populations.\n\n6. Lack of medical knowledge: European settlers had a limited understanding of basic medical practices, hygiene, and disease prevention, which contributed to the spread of diseases among themselves as well as among Native Americans. However, the Europeans' understanding of disease and medical treatment was still more advanced than that of many Native American populations, giving them an edge in coping with the new diseases that arrived.\n\nThe interactions between Native American populations, European settlers, and diseases resulted in a catastrophic decline in the population of indigenous peoples in the Americas. Understanding these complex factors can help shed light on the devastating consequences of colonization and the lasting impacts on indigenous cultures and communities.", "shortest_response": "The decimation of Native American populations by European diseases and the relative immunity of European explorers can be attributed to differences in prior exposure and immunity to these diseases.\n\nEuropeans had been exposed to many diseases, such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and tuberculosis, over centuries. This long-term exposure led to a gradual buildup of immunity within European populations. When these diseases were reintroduced to Europe by travelers from Asia or Africa, they often caused less severe illness or weren't as deadly as they were in vulnerable populations.\n\nOn the other hand, Native American populations had little to no exposure to these diseases, and thus had no immunity to them. When Europeans first arrived in the Americas, they unknowingly brought these diseases with them, which devastated the Native American population because they had no natural defenses against them. The diseases spread rapidly among the Native Americans, causing severe illness and death, leading to a dramatic population decline.\n\nThe difference in immune responses between the two populations demonstrates the crucial role of prior exposure to diseases in building up immunity, and highlights the devastating impact of diseases on populations with no prior exposure.", "input_size": 32, "output_sizes": [318, 457, 253, 674, 510, 421, 336, 510, 392, 413], "output_mean": 428.4, "output_std": 112.94, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 350.0, "p50": 417.0, "p75": 496.75, "p99": 659.24}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 15.56851}, {"sample_id": "57541c60e0859c58", "prompt_id": "e68834aa031574b2", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "continue to give me more sample dataset from https://threebestrated.ca.

Convexity, in finance, refers to the non-linear relationship between the price of an option and the change in the underlying asset's price. This non-linearity creates the potential for greater returns compared to a linear instrument like a stock or bond as the asset's price moves.\n\nWhen options are properly priced using the Black-Scholes or similar models, the expectations of future events (like the price movement of the underlying asset) are, in theory, incorporated into the price. However, market prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, not all of which can be accurately captured by these models.\n\nThe pricing models do a reasonably good job of incorporating expected volatility and risk-free interest rate, but they assume normal distributions, which may not always hold true in real-world scenarios. This assumption introduces potential errors, leaving room for arbitrage opportunities and mispricing, which might not always be immediately exploited by market participants.\n\nIn practice, the market is not perfectly efficient, and there's always a chance that an option will be mispriced due to human error, information asymmetry, or other factors. When this happens, investors can exploit the convexity of options to generate abnormal returns.\n\nIn summary, proper pricing does not remove the opportunity for convexity because it's based on assumptions and can still leave room for mispricing and arbitrage opportunities. However, it does reduce the likelihood of such opportunities, making them less common and potentially harder to identify.", "shortest_response": "In an ideal and perfectly efficient market where options are properly priced, it would be impossible to consistently profit from changes in volatility, as implied volatility would already accurately reflect the market's expectations.\n\nHowever, the existence of market inefficiencies, transaction costs, and information asymmetries can create opportunities for traders to exploit convexity and benefit from changes in volatility, even in a liquid and efficient market. Additionally, there are instances of temporary mispricing due to various reasons, such as panic selling or buyers'/sellers' reluctance, providing additional opportunities for skilled traders.\n\nIn summary, while a perfectly efficient market would remove the traditional opportunity for convexity trading, real-world markets are seldom perfect, and inefficiencies and imperfections can create opportunities for traders seeking to profit from changes in volatility.", "input_size": 19, "output_sizes": [322, 282, 180, 248, 215, 321, 274, 213, 269, 347], "output_mean": 267.1, "output_std": 51.16, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 223.25, "p50": 271.5, "p75": 311.25, "p99": 344.75}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 7.37884}, {"sample_id": "ff6c0a281249c6ec", "prompt_id": "b33fd1cd803bcf59", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "You are going to act as an english tutor.

Introduction\n\nDiffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that provides unique information about the microstructural properties of biological tissues. It relies on the Brownian motion of water molecules, which is hindered differently in various tissues due to their structural differences. The two most common quantitative measures derived from dMRI are Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC). FA measures the degree of diffusion anisotropy along different directions, and ADC provides information about the average rate of water movement.\n\nHowever, acquiring FA and ADC maps typically requires additional time and resources, which might be impractical in some clinical settings. Thus, a deep learning-based framework for synthesizing FA and ADC maps from routinely acquired T1w and T2w structural images could significantly improve the speed and efficiency of clinical workflows.\n\n2. Methodology\n\n2.1. Data Collection\n\n- Collect a diverse dataset of T1w, T2w, FA, and ADC images from different institutions and scanners.\n- Ensure the dataset is anatomically and pathologically diverse to capture the variability in brain tissue architectures.\n\n2.2. Preprocessing\n\n- Apply image registration to align the FA, ADC, and structural images to the T1w image space.\n- Normalize all images to a common intensity range.\n- Resample all images to a consistent voxel size.\n\n2.3. Augmentation\n\n- Apply random affine transformations, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping, to increase the dataset size and improve the model's generalization.\n\n2.4. Model Architecture\n\n- Propose a deep learning model architecture (e.g., U-Net, VAE, GAN, or a combination) for synthesizing FA and ADC maps from T1w and T2w images.\n- Incorporate skip connections, attention mechanisms, or other techniques to improve the model's performance.\n- Use a loss function that combines structural similarity (e.g., SSIM, CC) and quantitative dMRI metric similarity (e.g., MAE or MSE for FA and ADC) to train the model.\n\n2.5. Training\n\n- Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.\n- Use an optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam, RMSProp, or SGD) to train the model on the training set.\n- Monitor the model's performance on the validation set to avoid overfitting.\n- Apply early stopping based on the validation loss or accuracy.\n- Save the best-performing model for testing and potential deployment.\n\n2.6. Testing and Evaluation\n\n- Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing set in terms of structural similarity (e.g., SSIM, CC), and quantitative dMRI metric similarity (e.g., MAE or MSE for FA and ADC).\n- Compare the performance of the proposed model with other state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate its superiority.\n- Perform a statistical analysis to determine the significance of the results.\n\n3. Conclusion\n\n- Summarize the findings of the study, and discuss its implications for the clinical application of deep learning-based methods for synthesizing FA and ADC maps from T1w and T2w structural images.\n- Identify potential improvements or modifications to the framework.\n- Suggest directions for future research, including validation on larger datasets and further optimization of the model architecture.\n\n4. References\n\n- List the primary sources of data, models, and methodologies referenced in the study.\n- Cite relevant literature on deep learning-based synthesis of FA and ADC maps from structural images.\n\n5. Acknowledgements\n\n- Acknowledge the funding agencies, institutions, and individuals who contributed to the study.\n- Thank the reviewers for their valuable feedback and suggestions.\n\nExtensions:\n\n- Adding a multi-atlas synthesis component to improve the model's robustness.\n- Incorporating clinical information (e.g., age, gender, diagnosis) to develop patient-specific synthesis models.\n- Investigating the transferability of the model to other brain regions and species.\n- Integrating the synthesized FA and ADC maps into clinical decision-making processes.\n- Developing a web-based platform for easy access and implementation of the proposed model.", "shortest_response": "Creating a deep learning framework for synthesizing Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) maps from T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) structural images involves several steps. We'll outline a suggested approach using a multi-input U-Net architecture.\n\n1. **Data Collection**: Collect MRI scans with FA, ADC, T1w, and T2w images for different subjects. Ensure that the dataset is diverse enough to capture various brain states and pathologies.\n\n2. **Preprocessing**: Standardize the preprocessing steps to ensure consistency across the dataset. This includes skull stripping, normalization, and resampling.\n\n3. **Data Augmentation**: To prevent overfitting and help the model generalize better, perform data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming on the preprocessed images.\n\n4. **Network Architecture**: Use a U-Net-based architecture with multi-input channels to synthesize FA and ADC maps. The U-Net architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path to locate relevant features. Adjust the number of inputs to include T1w and T2w images, and optionally, include additional channels like age, sex, or diagnosis as needed.\n\n5. **Loss Function**: Since both synthesized FA and ADC maps values are continuous variables, use Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) as the loss function.

This is precisely what a GRU does.\n\nIn this assignment we adopt the original definition of the GRU from \\cite{cho}, in which a GRU is defined by the following update rules:\n\\begin{align\\*}\n\\mathbf{r}\\_j &= \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}\\_{r} \\mathbf{x}\\_j + \\mathbf{U}\\_{r} \\mathbf{h}\\_{j-1} ) \\\\\n\\mathbf{z}\\_j &= \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}\\_{z} \\mathbf{x}\\_j + \\mathbf{U}\\_{z} \\mathbf{h}\\_{j-1} ) \\\\\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{h}}\\_j &= \\tanh(\\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x}\\_j + \\mathbf{U} (\\mathbf{r}\\_j \\circ \\mathbf{h}\\_{j-1}) ) \\\\\n\\mathbf{h}\\_j &= (\\mathbf{1} - \\mathbf{z}\\_j) \\circ \\mathbf{\\tilde{h}}\\_j + \\mathbf{z}\\_j \\circ \\mathbf{h}\\_{j-1}\n\\end{align\\*}\nHere, $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid nonlinearity $\\sigma(x) =1/(1+\\exp(-x))$, and $\\circ$ denotes the element-wise multiplication of two vectors.\nLet's unpack these update rules.\nFirst, you compute the \\emph{reset gate} $\\mathbf{r}\\_j$ and the \\emph{update gate} $\\mathbf{z}\\_j$ as linear functions of the current input and the previous hidden state, passed through the sigmoid nonlinearity.\nBoth $\\mathbf{r}\\_j$ and $\\mathbf{z}\\_j$ are $h$-dimensional vectors with entries between 0 and 1, where $h$ is the dimension of the GRU's hidden state.\nThen you compute the candidate hidden state $\\tilde{\\mathbf{h}}\\_j$ as a function of the current input $\\mathbf{x}\\_j$ and a version of the previous hidden state, $\\mathbf{r}\\_j \\circ \\mathbf{h}\\_{j-1}$, where some entries of $\\mathbf{h}\\_{j-1}$ have been ``reset'' via being scaled with the entries in $\\mathbf{r}\\_j$.\nFinally, you compute the current hidden state $\\mathbf{h}\\_j$ as an interpolation between the prior hidden state $\\mathbf{h}\\_{j-1}$ and the candidate hidden state $\\tilde{\\mathbf{h}}\\_j$, where the weights of the interpolation are given by the update gate $\\mathbf{z}\\_j$.\n\nTo summarize: The reset gate $\\mathbf{r}\\_j$ controls whether the information from the old hidden state is erased or retained when computing the candidate hidden state. The update gate $\\mathbf{z}\\_j$ controls whether the old hidden state is retained or replaced by the candidate hidden state $\\tilde{\\mathbf{h}}\\_j$ when computing the new hidden state $\\mathbf{h}\\_j$.\n\n\\section{Problem 1 - Vanishing/Exploding Gradients (15 points)}\n\nConsider the following recurrent neural network (RNN), which maps a length-$m$ sequence $\\{ \\mathbf{x}\\_1, \\hdots, \\mathbf{x}\\_m \\}$ of vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ to a single vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^k$.\n\\begin{align\\*}\n\\mathbf{h}\\_0 &= \\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\mathbf{h}\\_{j} &= f(\\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x}\\_{j} + \\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{h}\\_{j-1}) \\quad j = 1 \\hdots m \\\\\n\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} &= \\mathbf{V} \\, \\mathbf{h}\\_m\n\\end{align\\*}\nHere, $\\mathbf{W} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\times d}$ are input weights, $\\mathbf{U} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\times h}$ are recurrent weights, and $\\mathbf{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times h}$ are output weights.\nThe vector of hidden units $\\mathbf{h}\\_j$ has dimension $h$.\nAssume that $f$ is an element-wise activation function.\n\nHere's the unrolled computational graph of this RNN:\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n\\node (x1) at (0, 0) {$\\mathbf{x}\\_1$};\n\\node (x2) at (2, 0) {$\\mathbf{x}\\_2$};\n\\node (x3) at (4, 0) {$\\mathbf{x}\\_3$};\n\\node (xT) at (8, 0) {$\\mathbf{x}\\_m$};\n\n\\node (h0) at (-2, 2) {$\\mathbf{0}$};\n\\node (h1) at (0, 2) {$\\mathbf{h}\\_1$};\n\\node (h2) at (2, 2) {$\\mathbf{h}\\_2$};\n\\node (h3) at (4, 2) {$\\mathbf{h}\\_3$};\n\\node (hdot) at (6, 2) {$\\hdots$};\n\\node (hT) at (8, 2) {$\\mathbf{h}\\_m$};\n\\node (y) at (10, 2) {$\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$};\n\n\\draw [->] (x1) -- node [left] {$\\mathbf{W}$} (h1);\n\\draw [->] (x2) -- node [left] {$\\mathbf{W}$} (h2);\n\\draw [->] (x3) -- node [left] {$\\mathbf{W}$} (h3);\n\\draw [->] (xT) -- node [left] {$\\mathbf{W}$} (hT);\n\n\\draw [->] (h0) -- (h1);\n\\draw [->] (h1) -- node [above] {$\\mathbf{U}$} (h2);\n\\draw [->] (h2) -- node [above] {$\\mathbf{U}$} (h3);\n\\draw [->] (h3) -- node [above] {$\\mathbf{U}$} (hdot);\n\\draw [->] (hdot) --node [above] {$\\mathbf{U}$} (hT);\n\\draw [->] (hT) -- node [above] {$\\mathbf{V}$} (y);\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\\end{center}\nIn this problem, we are interested in the quantity $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{h}\\_m}{\\partial \\mathbf{h}\\_1}$, a $h \\times h$ Jacobian matrix which contains the partial derivatives of the coordinates of $\\mathbf{h}\\_m$ with respect to the coordinates of $\\mathbf{h}\\_1$.\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{h}\\_m}{\\partial \\mathbf{h}\\_1} \\right)\\_{a,b} = \\frac{\\partial h\\_{ma}}{\\partial h\\_{1b}} $$\n\nThe ``vanishing gradient'' problem arises when $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{h}\\_m}{\\partial \\mathbf{h}\\_1}$ is small in norm, which means that time step 1 has negligible effect on the gradient $\\nabla\\_{\\mathbf{U}} L$.\nThe ``exploding gradient'' problem arises when $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{h}\\_m}{\\partial \\mathbf{h}\\_1}$ is large in norm, which means that time step 1 has an outsize effect on the gradient $\\nabla\\_{\\mathbf{U}} L$.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{(2 points)} Consider the simplified setting where the input, hidden, and output dimensions are all one ($d =h= k=1$).\nNote that in this simplified setting, the weight matrices $\\mathbf{W}$, $\\mathbf{U}$, and $\\mathbf{V}$ are just scalars $w$, $u$, and $v$.\n\nIt will be helpful to define $z\\_j$ as the pre-activation at time $j$, so that $z\\_{j} = w x\\_j + u h\\_{j-1}$ and $h\\_j = f(z\\_j)$.\n\nGive an explicit expression for the derivative $d h\\_m / d h\\_1$. Your expression should be in terms of $u$, the $z\\_j$'s, and $f'$, the derivative of the activation function.", "longest_response": "In the simplified setting, the derivatives can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. First, we find the recursive expression for the derivatives of the hidden state at each time step. We differentiate the hidden state equation with respect to the hidden state at the first time step, $h\\_1$:\n\n   $\\frac{\\partial h\\_j}{\\partial h\\_1} = \\frac{\\partial f(z\\_j)}{\\partial h\\_1} \\frac{\\partial z\\_j}{\\partial h\\_1}$.\n\n2. The derivative of the activation function $f(z\\_j)$ with respect to $h\\_1$ is 0, because $f(z\\_j)$ is a function of $z\\_j$ only, not $h\\_1$.\n\n3. The derivative of $z\\_j$ with respect to $h\\_1$ is the derivative of $w x\\_j$ (which is 0 because $x\\_j$ is a constant with respect to $h\\_1$) plus the derivative of $u h\\_{j-1}$ with respect to $h\\_1$:\n\n   $\\frac{\\partial z\\_j}{\\partial h\\_1} = u \\frac{\\partial h\\_{j-1}}{\\partial h\\_1}$.\n\n4. For the base case when $j = 1$, $\\frac{\\partial h\\_{j-1}}{\\partial h\\_1} = 1$ (because $h\\_{0} = 0$).\n\n5.

The derivative of $z\\_{j-1}$ with respect to $h\\_{j-1}$ is 1 (because the derivative of $u h\\_{j-1}$ with respect to $h\\_{j-1}$ is 1, and the derivative of $w x\\_j$ with respect to $h\\_{j-1}$ is 0).\n\n7. Combining the above steps, we get the recursive formula:\n\n   $\\frac{\\partial h\\_j}{\\partial h\\_1} = u f'(z\\_{j-1}) \\frac{\\partial h\\_{j-2}}{\\partial h\\_1}$.\n\n8.

The norm of this derivative will be large when $m$ is large and $uf'(z\\_1)$ is large (exploding gradient), or when $m$ is large and $uf'(z\\_1)$ is small (vanishing gradient).

Is that possible with the security model within the Edge browser?", "longest_response": "Creating an extension for Microsoft Edge that directly accesses the system's NetBIOS name and communicates it to a web service faces challenges due to the security model within the browser. However, it's still possible to achieve parts of the functionality with some modifications.\n\nHere's a conceptual approach to tackle this problem:\n\n1. **NetBIOS Name Access**: Directly accessing the NetBIOS name from the extension is not possible due to the security model within the browser. To overcome this, you can write native code (C++ or C#) to access the NetBIOS name and then pass it to your extension through Native Messaging.\n\n   Native Messaging allows an extension to send and receive messages with a native application. Use `chrome.runtime.sendNativeRequest()` and `chrome.runtime.onNativeResponseReceived` to send and receive messages between the extension and the native application.\n\n   **Note**: This approach is for Windows only (since Edge is built on Chromium, you can use this solution for Edge as well), as NetBIOS doesn't work on macOS and Linux.\n\n   First, register your native app from the `manifest.json` file in the extension:\n\n   ```json\n   \"native_messaging_host\": {\n     \"path\": \"native_app.exe\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Then, write the native application (C++ or C#) that accesses the NetBIOS name and sends the response back to the extension.\n\n2. **Communication with Web Service**: The extension can use the Fetch API to send a POST request to the web service with the NetBIOS name. However, since sending sensitive information like the NetBIOS name may violate CSPs (Content Security Policy) or other security measures, you must carefully manage this data flow.\n\n   One possible solution is to hash the NetBIOS name on the client-side before sending it to the web service. The web service can then compare the received hashed value with the expected hash to ensure integrity. This way, the actual NetBIOS name is never sent in clear text.\n\n   Ensure your extension follows best practices for secure communication with web services and handles user's data accordingly. A good starting point would be to review OWASP Top 10 for secure web applications.\n\n3. **Privacy and Permissions**: Since accessing the NetBIOS name is a sensitive task, it is essential to clarify to the user that your extension needs this functionality. You can use the `permissions` key in your extension's `manifest.json` file to request required permissions:\n\n   ```json\n   \"permissions\": [\"nativeMessaging\", \"activeTab\"],\n   ```\n\n   Also, consider adding a privacy policy to let users know how their data is being handled.", "shortest_response": "Creating an extension for the Edge browser that can access low-level system information like the NetBIOS name is challenging due to the security model of the browser. Extension APIs are designed to provide controlled access to browser functionalities, and system-level operations are generally restricted.\n\nHowever, you can create an extension that communicates with a web service hosted on your local machine or an allowed domain. This web service can then use system-level APIs to get the NetBIOS name and return it to the extension. This way, you maintain the security boundaries of the browser.\n\nFor implementing this solution:\n\n1. Develop a local web service (using technologies like ASP.NET or Node.js) that fetches the NetBIOS name using system-level APIs (on Windows, you can use WMI or Win32 APIs to get the NetBIOS name).\n\n2. Create an Edge extension using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The extension should:\n   - Communicate with your local web service (by making an AJAX request or using `fetch` API).\n   - Receive the NetBIOS name from the web service and use it as needed (e.g., store it in the browser storage or send it to a remote service).\n\n3.

The culprit is a malevolent force known as the Twig Blight Queen, a corrupt, sentient fungus entity born from the misuse of wild magic.\n\nThe Twisted Grove serves as an epic boss encounter, complete with minions, challenging terrain, and powerful magic. Let's dive into the details:\n\n1. The Twisted Grove (area/terrain):\nThe Twisted Grove is a haunted forest with towering, unnatural trees with gnarled branches covered in moss and fungi. The ground is marshy, with patches of poisonous, glowing mushrooms scattered throughout the area. Dark tendrils of shadowy mycelium weave their way among the trees, pulsating ominously.\n\n2. The Twig Blight Queen:\nThe Twig Blight Queen is a Colossal Fungus creature with tentacles, sporting twisted vines and fungal growths. It has multiple legs, glowing eyes, and a grotesque, twisted body that exhudes a noxious, potent spore cloud around it.\n\nAbilities:\n- Spore Cloud (AoE effect): When the Twig Blight Queen takes damage, it releases a noxious gas that creates a large radius cloud, reducing visibility and damaging all creatures within.\n- Tendrils of Shadow: The Twig Blight Queen can reach out with its shadowy tendrils to entangle and constrain enemies, slowing their movements and restricting their abilities.\n- Corruption Aura: The Twig Blight Queen constantly emits an aura of corruption, causing plants and foliage to wither and rot, and dealing necrotic damage to nearby enemies over time.\n- Fungal Swarm (AoE attack): The Twig Blight Queen can release a swarm of tiny, aggressive fungi that attack and debilitate enemies.\n- Wild Magic Burst: The Twig Blight Queen's magic has gone awry, becoming an unpredictable, wild force. When it uses its abilities, it has a chance to release a burst of magic that affects all creatures within a large area, either granting beneficial effects or dealing harmful ones.\n\n3. Minions/Supporting Creatures:\n- Rotting Harbingers: Rotting Harbingers are skeletal minions infused with the blight. They have a bone staff and can hurl blight spores at enemies, causing necrotic damage and debilitating abilities.\n- Blight Shamblers: Blight Shamblers are larger, slower undead creatures that can trample and knock opponents prone. They can also emit a noxious gas cloud like their master, the Twig Blight Queen.\n- Corrupted Wildfires: These are normally friendly creatures (bats, owls, etc.) that have been corrupted by the blight, gaining the ability to breathe poisonous, corrosive flames.\n- Blight Mushrooms: These sentient mushrooms work as traps, springing forth to ensnare enemies and poison them with their spores. They can also heal the Twig Blight Queen when allies are nearby.\n\n4. Event Triggers:\n- When the Twig Blight Queen is below a certain health threshold, it begins to panic and calls forth additional minions to aid it in combat.\n- When the party damages the Twig Blight Queen enough, it attempts to flee to another area of the forest, making the encounter even more challenging as the party must navigate through the treacherous terrain to continue attacking it.\n- If the party is taking too long to defeat the Twig Blight Queen, it releases a massive burst of wild magic that causes catastrophic destruction in the area, leaving a blighted scar on the land and alerting nearby factions to the threat.\n\nBy incorporating these ideas into a high-level boss encounter, the Twisted Grove and the Twig Blight Queen offer an engaging, action-packed, and challenging experience for the adventurers, with opportunities for strategic combat, exploration, and role-playing as they come to grips with the corruption of nature and the consequences of wild magic misuse.", "shortest_response": "Title: Twig Blight Grove Encounter\n\nLevel: 5-6\n\nSetting: A cursed grove of ancient, twisted willow trees, deep within the Whispering Woods.

First, create a new folder named `data` in the root directory of your Next.js project. Inside this folder, create a new JSON file (e.g., `data.json`). Populate the file with the desired data, ensuring it's valid JSON format.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"title\": \"Item 1\",\n    \"description\": \"This is item 1 from the database.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 2,\n    \"title\": \"Item 2\",\n    \"description\": \"This is item 2 from the database.\"\n  },\n  // ...add more items as needed\n]\n```\n\n2. Next, create a new component in the `components` folder. For this example, name the component `FetchDataComponent`. Create the component's JavaScript file in the `components` folder.\n\n```bash\nmkdir components\ntouch components/FetchDataComponent.js\n```\n\n3. Open the `FetchDataComponent.js` file and import the necessary libraries:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport fetch from 'isomorphic-unfetch';\n\nexport default function FetchDataComponent() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Fetch data from external JSON file\n  }, []);\n\n  // ... rest of the component code\n}\n```\n\n4. Install `isomorphic-unfetch`, if not already installed:\n\n```bash\nnpm install isomorphic-unfetch\n```\n\n5. Fetch the data from the external JSON file using `isomorphic-unfetch` in the effect function:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport fetch from 'isomorphic-unfetch';\n\nexport default function FetchDataComponent() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      const response = await fetch('/api/data');\n      const jsonData = await response.json();\n      setData(jsonData);\n    };\n\n    fetchData();\n  }, []);\n\n  // ... rest of the component code\n}\n```\n\n6. Since we're fetching data from an external file, let's create a new API route (`/api/data`) that takes care of serving the data:\n\n```bash\ntouch pages/api/data.js\n```\n\n7. Open the `/api/data.js` file and import `next`:\n\n```javascript\nimport next from 'next';\n\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  const app = next({ dev: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' });\n  const handle = app.getRequestHandler();\n\n  const data = await import('../data/data.json');\n\n  return {\n    props: { data }, // will be passed to the page component as props\n  };\n}\n```\n\n8. Finally, update the component to use the fetched data and loop over it:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport fetch from 'isomorphic-unfetch';\n\nexport default function FetchDataComponent({ data }) {\n  const [posts, setPosts] = useState(data);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setPosts(data);\n  }, [data]);\n\n  if (!Array.isArray(posts)) return null;\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li key={post.id}>\n          <h2>{post.title}</h2>\n          <p>{post.description}</p>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can use the `FetchDataComponent` in your pages by importing it and passing the `data` prop:\n\n```javascript\nimport FetchDataComponent from '../components/FetchDataComponent';\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return <FetchDataComponent />;\n}\n```\n\nWhen you run your Next.js application, it will fetch the data from the `data.json` file and loop over it in the `FetchDataComponent`.", "shortest_response": "To create a Next.js component that fetches data from an external JSON file and loops over the data, you can follow these steps:\n\n1.

Let's discuss each of them with examples and code snippets for better understanding.\n\n1. SQL Joins: Joins are used to combine two or more tables based on a related column between them. The most common types of SQL joins are INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN (also known as LEFT OUTER JOIN), RIGHT JOIN (also known as RIGHT OUTER JOIN), and FULL OUTER JOIN.\n\nExample (INNER JOIN): Assume we have the following two tables: `Orders` and `Customers`.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Orders (\n    OrderID int,\n    CustomerID int,\n    OrderDate date\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE Customers (\n    CustomerID int,\n    CustomerName varchar(50),\n    ContactName varchar(50),\n    Country varchar(50)\n);\n\nINSERT INTO Orders VALUES (1, 1, DATE('2021-01-01'));\nINSERT INTO Orders VALUES (2, 2, DATE('2021-02-01'));\nINSERT INTO Orders VALUES (3, 3, DATE('2021-03-01'));\nINSERT INTO Customers VALUES (1, 'Alfreds Futterkiste', 'Maria Anders', 'Germany');\nINSERT INTO Customers VALUES (2, 'Around the Horn', 'Thomas Hardy', 'UK');\nINSERT INTO Customers VALUES (3, 'Berglunds snabbk\u00f6p', 'Christina Berglund', 'Sweden');\n```\n\nTo retrieve both `Orders` and `Customers` tables with common data, we use an INNER JOIN:\n\n```sql\nSELECT o.OrderID, c.CustomerName, o.OrderDate\nFROM Orders AS o\nINNER JOIN Customers AS c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nOrderID | CustomerName | OrderDate\n--------+--------------+------------\n1       | Alfreds Futterkiste | 2021-01-01\n3       | Berglunds snabbk\u00f6p | 2021-03-01\n```\n\n2. SQL Views: A view is a virtual table that is based on the result-set of an SQL query. It contains rows and columns, just like a real table.\n\nExample:\n\n```sql\nCREATE VIEW Order_Details AS\nSELECT OrderID, CustomerName, OrderDate\nFROM Orders JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;\n```\n\nNow, you can execute the query using the `Order_Details` view:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Order_Details;\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nOrderID | CustomerName  | OrderDate\n--------+---------------+------------\n1       | Alfreds Futterkiste | 2021-01-01\n3       | Berglunds snabbk\u00f6p | 2021-03-01\n```\n\n3. Common Table Expressions (CTEs): A CTE is a temporary result set that is defined within the execution scope of a single SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.\n\nExample:\n\n```sql\nWITH Orders_CTE AS (\n    SELECT OrderID, CustomerName, OrderDate\n    FROM Orders JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID\n),\nActiveCustomers AS (\n    SELECT * FROM Orders_CTE\n    WHERE OrderDate >= (SELECT MAX(OrderDate) FROM Orders_CTE)\n)\nSELECT * FROM ActiveCustomers;\n```\n\n4. User-Defined Functions (UDFs): UDFs are custom functions created by users to reuse and encapsulate common SQL logic.\n\nExample: Create a user-defined function to calculate the age of a customer based on the `OrderDate`:\n\n```sql\nCREATE FUNCTION GetCustomerAge(orderdate date, customerdate date) RETURNS int\nBEGIN\n    DECLARE result int;\n    SET result = DATEDIF(orderdate, customerdate, 'YEAR');\n    RETURN result;\nEND;\n```\n\nCall the UDF to calculate the age of customers:\n\n```sql\nSELECT CustomerID, GetCustomerAge(OrderDate, '1990-01-01') as CustomerAge\nFROM Orders\nJOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nCustomerID | CustomerAge\n-----------+-------------\n1           | 31\n3           | 30\n```", "shortest_response": "SQL Joins, Views, Common Table Expressions (CTE), and User-Defined Functions (UDF) are powerful features in SQL that help structure and manipulate data effectively. Let's cover each one with examples and code.\n\n1. **SQL Joins**: SQL Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.\n\n   - Inner Join: Returns only the matched rows (rows where there is a match in both tables).\n\n     ```sql\n     SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName\n     FROM Orders\n     INNER JOIN Customers\n     ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;\n     ```\n\n   - Left Join: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the right side.\n\n     ```sql\n     SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID\n     FROM Customers\n     LEFT JOIN Orders\n     ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;\n     ```\n\n   - Right Join: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the left side.\n\n     ```sql\n     SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName\n     FROM Orders\n     RIGHT JOIN Customers\n     ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;\n     ```\n\n2. **SQL Views**: SQL Views are virtual tables based on the result-set of an SQL statement. They provide a simpler way to access complex queries and hide the complexity from the user.\n\n     ```sql\n     CREATE VIEW SalesByCategory AS\n     SELECT CategoryName, SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity) as TotalSale\n     FROM OrderDetails\n     GROUP BY CategoryName;\n     ```\n\n     To query a view:\n\n     ```sql\n     SELECT * FROM SalesByCategory;\n     ```\n\n3. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: CTEs are temporary result sets within a single execution of a SQL statement. They are useful for simplifying complex queries and improving readability.\n\n     ```sql\n     WITH CTE_Name AS (\n     SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(OrderID) as NumberOfOrders\n     FROM Orders\n     GROUP BY CustomerID\n     )\n     SELECT Orders.CustomerID, Customers.CustomerName, CTE_Name.NumberOfOrders\n     FROM Orders\n     JOIN Customers\n     ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID\n     JOIN CTE_Name\n     ON Orders.CustomerID = CTE_Name.CustomerID;\n     ```\n\n4. **User-Defined Functions (UDF)**: UDFs are custom functions created by users to reuse a set of SQL statements for different queries.\n\n     ```sql\n     CREATE FUNCTION GetTotalSale (@CategoryName nvarchar(50))\n     RETURNS money\n     AS\n     BEGIN\n     RETURN (\n     SELECT SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity)\n     FROM OrderDetails\n     WHERE CategoryName = @CategoryName\n     )\n     END;\n     ```\n\n     To call the function:\n\n     ```sql\n     SELECT dbo.GetTotalSale('Sports');\n     ```", "input_size": 23, "output_sizes": [916, 864, 777, 795, 837, 889, 964, 870, 1146, 975], "output_mean": 903.3, "output_std": 101.4, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 843.75, "p50": 879.5, "p75": 952.0, "p99": 1130.61}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 29.6961}, {"sample_id": "b502da794dcc544d", "prompt_id": "eaed343efbad2253", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "please generate me a lambda function that resizes an image. the image is recieved from bucket \"original\\_images\" and is put into the bucket \"resized\\_images\", use imageio to resize", "longest_response": "To create a AWS Lambda function that resizes an image using the Imageio library, you'll need to write the function in Python.

For each ordered pair of cities (u, v) you know the cost c[u][v] > 0 of flying directly from u to v. In particular, there is a flight between every pair of cities. Each such flight takes one day and flight costs are not necessarily symmetric.\n\nSuppose you are in city u and you want to get to city v. You would like to use this opportunity to obtain frequent flyer status. In order to get the status, you have to travel on at least minDays consecutive days. What is the minimum total cost c(u, v) of a flight schedule that gets you from u to v in at least minDays days?\n\nDesign a dynamic programming algorithm to solve this problem. Assume you can access c[x][y] for any pair x, y in constant time.

The idea is to calculate the minimum cost to reach each city after every possible number of days, from 1 to `minDays`.\n\n1. Initialize an array `dp` of size `(N+1) x minDays`. Set all the elements to infinity (`INT_MAX`). Initial values for `dp[u][1]` and `dp[v][minDays]` will be zero as we start from city `u` and want to reach city `v` in `minDays` days.\n\n2. Implement a loop iterating from 2 to `minDays`. For each day `i` (from 2 to `minDays`), we will try to find the minimum cost of reaching other cities from city `u`.\n\n   For each city `j` (from 1 to N), we will calculate the value of `dp[j][i]` as the minimum cost to reach city `j` after `i-1` days, plus the cost of flying from the last city to city `j` on the `i`th day.\n\n   ```cpp\n   for (int i = 2; i <= minDays; ++i) {\n       for (int j = 1; j <= N; ++j) {\n           for (int k = 1; k <= N; ++k) {\n               dp[j][i] = min(dp[j][i], dp[k][i-1] + c[k][j]);  // Visit another city k before visiting j on day i\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. The final answer is `dp[v][minDays]`.\n\n```cpp\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int INF = numeric_limits<int>::max();\n\nint c[51][51];\nint u, v, minDays, N;\nint dp[51][51];\n\nvoid bellman_ford() {\n    for (int i = 1; i <= minDays; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 1; j <= N; ++j) {\n            for (int k = 1; k <= N; ++k) {\n                dp[j][i] = min(dp[j][i], dp[k][i-1] + c[k][j]);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Input\n    cin >> N >> u >> v >> minDays;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i)\n        for (int j = 1; j <= N; ++j)\n            cin >> c[i][j];\n\n    bellman_ford();\n    cout << dp[v][minDays] << '\\n';\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis algorithm solves the problem and calculates the minimum cost of reaching city `v` from city `u` in at least `minDays` days, taking into account the cost asymmetry between cities. The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(N^3 * minDays)`, as we have three nested loops. If the input size `N` is small enough, this algorithm should solve the problem efficiently.", "shortest_response": "To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach similar to the Bellman-Ford algorithm, but instead of focusing on negative edge weights, we focus on the minimum cost to reach a city in `minDays` or fewer days. Here's a step-by-step outline of the algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize an `N x (minDays + 1)` 2D-table `dp` with infinite values `(INF)`. Set `dp[u][1] = 0`, as we don't need to pay any cost to stay in city `u` on the first day.\n\n2. Iterate through the number of days from `1` to `minDays`. For each day `i`:\n   a. Iterate through all cities `j` from `1` to `N`.\n   b. For city `j`, update the minimum cost `dp[j][i]` to be the minimum of the current value and the cost of flying from the current city to `j` plus the cost of the `i-1` previous days:\n      - If `i > 1`, then the cost for the previous days is `dp[j][i-1]`.\n      - If `i = 1`, then there's no need to consider any previous days, so set the cost to `INF`.\n\n3. Once the table is filled, the minimum cost to reach city `v` in at least `minDays` days is the minimum of `dp[v][minDays]` and `dp[v][minDays - 1]`. This is because if we can reach `v` in exactly `minDays` days, that will be the minimum cost. If we cannot reach `v` in exactly `minDays` days, we need to find the minimum cost over the previous `minDays - 1` days to see if there's a cheaper alternative.\n\nThis algorithm runs in O(N\\*minDays^2) time, since we are iterating over every city and day once. The space complexity is O(N\\*minDays) due to the 2D-table.\n\nBy considering the dynamic states of being in a city on a specific day, we can solve the problem efficiently.

They can be mined and used as fuel to drive a regenerative economy instead of a degenerative economy.\n\nThe solution - Internalization of costs\nImagine a world where the true cost of industrial agriculture and other industries are accounted for in our economic system. Instead of incentivizing farmers and companies to adopt unsustainable practices, such as monoculture and heavy use of chemical inputs, we would be encouraging them to adopt sustainable, regenerative practices that benefit both the environment and human health. This can be achieved by implementing fees on pollution and the use of resources, such as carbon and water.\n\nInternalizing these costs not only benefits the environment, but it also leads to greater innovation, efficiency, job creation, and ultimately lower costs for society as a whole. Additionally, by implementing a fee and dividend system, where a portion of the fees collected are distributed back to the public, we can ensure that this solution is not regressive and that the most vulnerable members of society are not disproportionately impacted.\n\nHowever, few governments have taken the necessary steps to implement this solution (only Austria switzerland and six canadian provinces have implemented a fee and dividend on carbon pollution). That's where the Fresh Earth token comes in. By utilizing blockchain technology, the Fresh Earth token aims to create a transparent and verifiable impact for sustainable agrifood projects, and stimulate investment in regenerative agriculture. By taking this approach, we can work towards a future where the cost of destroying our environment and human health is no longer externalized, but internalized and paid for by those who are causing the damage.\n\nThe opportunity\nThere is a growing demand for change in the food industry, driven by consumers who are increasingly concerned about the quality and sustainability of their food. Digitization and the lack of it in the supply chain also creates an opportunity for innovation and disruption in the agricultural industry. The Fresh Earth ecosystem is designed to address these issues and create a more sustainable, resilient food system.\n\nThe opportunity to create positive impacts by transforming the Agri-food industry is enormous and many are now pursuing it.\n\nAgriculture and food could be the biggest solution by regenerating land and health.\n\nAn Agri-Food revolution is already underway.\n\nHundreds of billions of $ are looking to invest in it.\n\nAgri-food and health are each $10T global industries, with a combined true cost of $50T.\n\nIf people had to spend twice as much to get Regen food, it would still be cheaper + healthier.\n\nAgri-food is the least digitized of the major industries.\n\nIn the US, 40% of produce is wasted and food loss accounts for 8% of GHG gas emissions.\n\nConsumer awareness and demand for more eco-friendly & healthy food is rapidly growing.\n\nThe industry is fragmented with duplication of effort and gaps in existing approaches, and limited coordination between new initiatives. Solutions lack scale and synergy.\n\nRegenerative agriculture is currently being adopted to millions of hectares globally.\n\nHigh tech methods, including for measurement and validation, are rapidly progressing.\n\nGov. and private initiatives, including the X prize, will boost everything.\n\nNone of this is big and fast enough to regenerate faster than we degenerate.\n\nThis means huge opportunity if approached at scale and with \u2018outside the box\u2019 solutionsThe Fresh Earth Ecosystem\n\n3. The Fresh Earth ecosystem\nThe Fresh Earth ecosystem is a revolutionary solution for transforming the agri-food industry and addressing pressing issues of climate change, health, and food security. By creating a global, community-based food system, Fresh Earth empowers individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources and improve the quality and nutritional density of the food they consume. The system is designed to internalize the costs of the food system and redistribute the money back into the ecosystem through token sales and rewards, creating an economic engine for the ecosystem. By incentivizing participation and engagement, the Fresh Earth token driven system acts as an impact generation machine at scale, driving participation, investment, and the transition to regenerative practices.\n\nThe Fresh Earth ecosystem is composed of several key components that intermesh to drive participation, investment and the transition to regenerative practices. These include:\n\nFresh Earth Token: At the heart of the ecosystem is the Fresh Earth Token, a powerful tool that represents fractional ownership of the food ecosystem business, serving as a store of value that can be held by stakeholders as a liquid financial reservoir, retaining its value and purchasing power over time. It leverages the future impact of regenerative projects to secure external funding from government schemes such as carbon trading, and ESG investors. it also drives the Rewards System, incentivizing participation and engagement of stakeholders within the ecosystem, including farmers, consumers, and investors, towards the common goal of regenerating land and promoting sustainable practices. \n\nData Managment Platform: Based on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity, water retention, and food nutritional density, this is a science-driven approach to measuring and validating the impact outcomes of regenerative practices and projects. It uses an open-source sandbox environment for data access and analytics, providing transparency and accountability for stakeholders. The immense amount of data gathered over time will be a monetizable value to a world in transition.\n\nB2B Marketplace - (B2B): A digital platform connects farmers on the regenerative pathway with businesses, reducing costs and risks for farms and allowing businesses to access verified, locally developed regenerative food products directly from the designers, manufacturers, and producers.\n\nThe Project Management Platform is a comprehensive solution for the design, implementation, and commercialization of validated health and farm programs. It operates as a B2B marketplace that brings together various stakeholders, including health experts, farm experts, suppliers, end users, and universities, government, and policy makers, to ensure high-quality programs that meet the needs of all parties involved. The platform offers a range of tools and features, including project creation and management, data analysis and visualization, B2B marketplace support, validation systems, and group management tools, all powered by cutting-edge technology. The technology stack, which combines server-side, front-end, database, and cloud-based technologies, ensures the platform delivers its key features and benefits, including increased innovation, reduced costs, increased efficiency, rapid innovation, and shared knowledge. The platform's goal is to support the transition towards a regenerative, healthy, and transparent food system and drive positive change in the agri-food industry.\n\nRewards System: This component Incentivizes participation and engagement within the ecosystem by rewards stakeholders for their contributions that recognizes the value of their participation, promoting transparency and decentralization in the management of the food ecosystem business.\n\nThese components work together to create a comprehensive, community-based food system that empowers individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources and improve the quality and nutritional density of the food they consume.\n\nThe sophisticated tech platform is designed so that the Ecosystem operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that facilitates the food ecosystem business. \n\nA Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a digital organization that is run by a set of rules encoded in smart contracts on a blockchain network. The rules and governance of a DAO are determined by its token holders, who have ownership over the organization through their possession of the organization's native token. Transactions and decisions within a DAO are recorded on the blockchain, providing transparency and immutability. DAOs are often created to manage decentralized projects or communities, and can operate without the need for a central authority or intermediary.Logic of Fresh Earth and the Token.\n\nThis structure allows investors to participate in the growth and success of the ecosystem and share in the value generated. To facilitate efficiency the Fresh Earth DAO includes multi-tiered governance and decision-making, with a board of directors, advisory board, and a voting system for major decisions, as well as systems for transparently tracking and reporting the use of funds and the impact of the ecosystem to provide added security and accountability for the investors.\n\nThe Fresh Earth ecosystem is a perfect example of how tokenization can be used to create a more equitable and sustainable world, with the power to drive real change and make a positive impact on the planet and society. It's unique combination of token archetypes, underlying value and network value, makes it a strong and adaptable mechanism for promoting the growth and success of the regenerative agriculture ecosystem.\n\n4. Tokennomics\nToken name and symbol: \nFresh Earth Token (FET)\n\nToken Overview \nThe Fresh Earth Token (FET) is the backbone of the Fresh Earth ecosystem, serving as a means to pull the future impact of regenerative projects to the present to fund the projects; and also as the primary means of incentivizing participation and engagement of stakeholders, including farmers, consumers, and investors. \n\nThe Fresh Earth token is designed to contribute to the transition towards a more sustainable and regenerative food system, and address the pressing issues of climate change and environmental degradation in the agricultural industry. It incentivizes regenerative agricultural practices and enables investment in sustainable agrifood projects by creating a token economy that rewards farmers, consumers, and impact investors for their participation in the regenerative agricultural ecosystem. \n\nThe Fresh Earth Token is more than just a financial instrument; it is a tool for change. It gives individuals and businesses choice and tools to actively participate in the transition to a more sustainable, healthy and regenerative food system, ensuring that the ecosystem is moving towards its goal of regenerating land and promoting sustainable practices, while also providing a store of value and an opportunity for profit. \n\nToken Structure\nThe token represents fractional ownership of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that facilitates the food ecosystem business. It is used to access and participate in the Fresh Earth ecosystem, to make decisions in the governance of the ecosystem and to serve within the community of regenerative farmers, consumers, and impact investors. \n\nThe token operates through a set of algorithms that are designed to generate verifiable impact within the ecosystem. These algorithms take into account the actions and participation of all stakeholders, including farmers, consumers, and investors, in order to ensure that the ecosystem is moving towards its goal of regenerating land and promoting sustainable practices.\n\nThe underlying value of the Fresh Earth Token is derived from the worth of the stakeholder-owned Fresh Earth ecosystem, along with the valuation and monetisation of the impacts of regenerative projects. The value of the ecosystem is determined by the stakeholders, while the impact of regenerative projects is measured by key performance indicators (KPIs) such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity, water retention", "longest_response": "The text discusses the challenges faced by the industrial agriculture industry, including unsustainable practices, soil degradation, and food insecurity.

This example assumes you have Node.js installed and have the `coffee-script`, `backbone`, `underscore`, and `handlebars` modules installed.

This example uses the `coffee-script` module and the `express` framework:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express')\nconst app = express()\nconst coffee = require('coffee-script')\nconst fs = require('fs')\nconst path = require('path')\n\napp.set('view engine', 'html')\napp.engine('html', require('ejs').renderFile)\n// add any static files (images, css, js, etc.)\napp.use(express.static('public'))\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  const template = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'views', 'index.html'), 'utf8')\n  res.render('index', { title: 'Simple Counter App' })\n})\n\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n  console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000')\n})\n```\n\nCreate a folder named `views`, and put your `counter-template.html` file inside it.\n\nNow, create another folder named `public`, and have the following files:\n\n- index.html:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <title><%= title %></title>\n  <!-- scripts and styles -->\n</head>\n<body>\n  <script src=\"/assets/script/backbone.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"/assets/script/underscore.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"/assets/script/handlebars.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"/assets/script/app.js\"></script>\n  <!-- your main application content here -->\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n- assets (folder):\n- assets/script (folder):\n  - backbone.js\n  - underscore.js\n  - handlebars.js\n  - app.js (generated by the coffee compilation)\n\nAfter setting up the files, run the server using:\n\n```bash\ncoffee server.coffee\n```\n\nNow you can open your browser and access the counter application at `http://localhost:3000`.

It aims to solve the problem of having a single source of truth for the state of your application (single state tree) and make it easy to connect components to that state.\n\n**Redux:**\n1. **Actions:** These are plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened. Actions do not describe how the application's state changes; instead, they carry the data required for the next state change.\n\n```javascript\nconst INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';\nconst DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';\n\nfunction increment() {\n  return { type: INCREMENT };\n}\n\nfunction decrement() {\n  return { type: DECREMENT };\n}\n```\n\n2. **Reducers:** They are pure functions that accept the previous state and an action, and then return the next state. In a reducer, you switch on the `type` property of the action and return the new state.\n\n```javascript\nfunction counter(state = 0, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case INCREMENT:\n      return state + 1;\n    case DECREMENT:\n      return state - 1;\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. **Store:** It holds the state tree of your app and allows access to it. The store can be created using the `createStore` function provided by Redux.\n\n```javascript\nimport { createStore } from 'redux';\nimport counter from './counter';\n\nconst store = createStore(counter);\n```\n\n**React Redux:**\n\nReact Redux provides the `Provider` component that allows you to pass the store to your application and the `connect` function for connecting your components to the store.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux';\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport rootReducer from './reducers';\nimport App from './App';\nimport store from './store';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <Provider store={store}>\n    <App />\n  </Provider>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n```\n\nFor a connected component, you have to write a container component that uses the `connect` function to map the state and actions to props.\n\n```javascript\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\nimport Counter from './Counter';\n\nconst MapStateToProps = (state) => {\n  return { count: state };\n};\n\nconst MapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {\n  return {\n    onIncrement: () => dispatch(increment()),\n    onDecrement: () => dispatch(decrement()),\n  };\n};\n\nconst ConnectedCounter = connect(\n  MapStateToProps,\n  MapDispatchToProps\n)(Counter);\n```\n\nIn the next reply, I'll cover more about React Redux and provide examples for handling asynchronous actions and middleware.\n\n**Reply 2: React Redux - Asynchronous Actions and Middleware**\n\nAsynchronous actions can be handled with Redux through middleware like `redux-thunk`, `redux-saga`, or `redux-observable`. In this example, I'll demonstrate the usage of redux-thunk.\n\nTo install redux-thunk:\n```bash\nnpm install --save redux-thunk\n```\n\nIn our reducer, we add a default case to the switch statement that handles the actions returning functions containing the logic to perform async operations.\n\n```javascript\nfunction counter(state = 0, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case INCREMENT:\n      return state + 1;\n    case DECREMENT:\n      return state - 1;\n    case FETCH_COUNTER_START:\n      return { ...state, isLoading: true };\n    case FETCH_COUNTER_END:\n      return { ...state, isLoading: false, counter: action.payload };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's create the `incrementAsync`, `decrementAsync`, and `fetchCounter` actions:\n\n```javascript\nconst INCREMENT_ASYNC = 'INCREMENT_ASYNC';\nconst DECREMENT_ASYNC = 'DECREMENT_ASYNC';\nconst FETCH_COUNTER_START = 'FETCH_COUNTER_START';\nconst FETCH_COUNTER_END = 'FETCH_COUNTER_END';\n\nfunction incrementAsync() {\n  return { type: INCREMENT_ASYNC };\n}\n\nfunction decrementAsync() {\n  return { type: DECREMENT_ASYNC };\n}\n\nfunction fetchCounter() {\n  return async (dispatch) => {\n    dispatch({ type: FETCH_COUNTER_START });\n    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/counter');\n    const count = await response.json();\n    dispatch({ type: FETCH_COUNTER_END, payload: count });\n  };\n}\n```\n\nDon't forget to update the imports in your connected component:\n\n```javascript\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\nimport Counter from './Counter';\nimport { increment, decrement, fetchCounter } from './actions';\n```\n\nFinally, map the async actions to props in your container component:\n\n```javascript\nconst MapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {\n  return {\n    onIncrement: () => dispatch(increment()),\n    onDecrement: () => dispatch(decrement()),\n    onFetchCounter: () => dispatch(fetchCounter()),\n  };\n};\n```\n\n**Reply 3: Final Thoughts and Resources**\n\nIn this final reply, I want to discuss some best practices when using React Redux and provide resources to learn more.\n\n1. **Naming Conventions**: Use action constants with uppercase letters separated by underscores, action creators with camelCase, and reducers with PascalCase.\n\n2. **One Source of Truth**: Maintain a single state tree for your entire application. Avoid using local state in connected components when possible.\n\n3. **Immutable Data**: Modify the state immutably by creating new objects instead of modifying existing ones. This guarantees predictable state transitions.\n\n4. **Code Organization**: Break your files into smaller modules, such as actions, reducers, and containers. This makes your code easier to read, understand, and maintain.\n\nFor more resources about Redux and React Redux, check out the following:\n- Redux Official Documentation: https://redux.js.org/\n- Redux Toolkit: https://redux-toolkit.js.org/\n- Redux Thunk: https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk\n- Redux Saga: https://redux-saga.js.org/\n- Redux Observable: https://redux-observable.js.org/", "shortest_response": "Reply 1: Introduction to React Redux\n\nReact Redux is the official Redux UI binding library for React. It allows you to bind your React components to Redux's store, making it easier to manage the state of complex applications. Redux helps in managing the application's state, especially when you have multiple components interacting with each other.\n\nRedux follows three principles:\n\n1. **Single Source of Truth**: The entire state of the application is stored in an object (stored in an immutable state container called the store).\n\n2. **State is read-only**: Once the state is created, it can never be modified. Instead, a new state object must be created whenever the state needs to change.\n\n3. **Changes are made with pure functions**: Changes to the state are made using a function called a reducer, which takes the current state and an action as inputs, and returns the new state.\n\nHere is a simple example of a Redux store that manages a counter.\n\n```javascript\n// Define the actions\nconst INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';\nconst DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';\n\nconst increment = () => ({ type: INCREMENT });\nconst decrement = () => ({ type: DECREMENT });\n\n// Define the initial state\nconst initialState = {\n  counter: 0\n};\n\n// Define the reducer\nconst counterReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case INCREMENT:\n      return { ...state, counter: state.counter + 1 };\n    case DECREMENT:\n      return { ...state, counter: state.counter - 1 };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\n// Create the store\nimport { createStore } from 'redux';\n\nconst store = createStore(counterReducer);\n```\n\nIn the above example, we have actions (increment and decrement), an initial state, and a reducer that handles the actions to update the state.\n\nReply 2: Connecting React Components to Redux\n\nTo connect a React component to a Redux store using React Redux, you will need the `connect` function. This function is provided by the `react-redux` library. Here's an example of how to use it:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\n\n// Define the Counter component\nconst Counter = ({ counter }) => (\n  <div>\n    Current Count: {counter}\n  </div>\n);\n\n// Connect the Counter component to the Redux store\nconst mapStateToProps = state => ({\n  counter: state.counter\n});\n\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(Counter);\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a Counter component that displays the current count from the Redux store. The `mapStateToProps` function maps the parts of the state that the component needs, in this case the `counter`.\n\nReply 3: Dispatching Actions in React Components\n\nTo dispatch an action from a connected React component, you can use the `dispatch` function provided by React Redux. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\nimport { increment, decrement } from './actions'; // Import the actions\n\nconst Counter = ({ counter, increment, decrement }) => (\n  <div>\n    <button onClick={increment}>+</button>\n    <span>{counter}</span>\n    <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>\n  </div>\n);\n\nconst mapStateToProps = state => ({\n  counter: state.counter\n});\n\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps, { increment, decrement })(Counter);\n```\n\nIn this example, we have a Counter component that has buttons to increment and decrement the counter. The `increment` and `decrement` actions are dispatched when the buttons are clicked. The `connect` function is used to provide the `increment` and `decrement` functions to the Counter component.", "input_size": 24, "output_sizes": [1612, 1217, 1058, 1654, 1322, 1488, 946, 1363, 1147, 1622], "output_mean": 1342.9, "output_std": 237.05, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 1164.5, "p50": 1342.5, "p75": 1581.0, "p99": 1651.12}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 48.10833}, {"sample_id": "d1e324060da49eec", "prompt_id": "2738057268544bc4", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "How do I process unicode text files in powershell?", "longest_response": "To process Unicode text files (UTF-8 encoding is common for Unicode files) in PowerShell, you can use the `Get-Content` cmdlet with the `-Encoding` parameter.

To simplify this, let's focus on creating a high-level outline and some key components needed for such a class.\n\nYou'll need the following components for your class:\n\n1. LLVM Library: Include the LLVM C++ library for generating IR. You can find it here: https://llvm.org/docs/Developerpolicy.html#cplusplus-api\n\n2. Rust Frontend Parser: You can use the Rust language's parser combinator library (known as `combine` or `parexp` libraries) to create a parser, or integrate with existing tooling like `Rustc` or `Rustup`. Here's a basic structure of a Rust AST:\n\n```\npub enum AstNode {\n    Expr(Box<ExprNode>),\n    Stmt(Box<StmtNode>),\n    // ... other Nodes\n}\n\npub trait ExprNode {\n    fn get_ast_type(&self) -> &'static str;\n    // ... other methods\n}\n\npub trait StmtNode {\n    fn get_ast_type(&self) -> &'static str;\n    // ... other methods\n}\n```\n\n3. Visitor Pattern: Use the visitor pattern to traverse the Rust AST and generate LLVM IR. This can help you encapsulate the complexity of IR generation into a separate concern.\n\nNow, let's outline a high-level structure for your C++ classes:\n\nA. `RustAst`: This class should contain a pointer to the Rust AST obtained from a Rust frontend parser.\n\nB. `LLVMAstVisitor`: This visitor class should traverse and process nodes of the Rust AST.\n\nC. `RustAstVisitor`: Implement the visitor pattern in this class to handle visits to different nodes in the Rust AST. This class should keep an instance of `LLVMAstVisitor` as a member.\n\nD. `LLVMAstVisitor`: Responsible for visiting different nodes in the Rust AST and generating LLVM IR code. For each node, override the visit method based on the type, then call another function to actually generate the IR code.\n\nE. `RustToLLVMIRGenerator`: A factory-like class to create `RustAstVisitor` instances and help initialize the required LLVM IR objects (such as `LLVMContext`, `Module`, `Builder`, etc.)\n\nHere's a pseudo-code example for the visitor pattern and LLVM IR generation:\n\n```cpp\n// Rust AST type\nenum class RustAstNode {\n    Expr,\n    Stmt,\n    // ... other nodes\n};\n\n// LLVM IR Generator interface\nclass LLVMAstVisitor {\npublic:\n    virtual void visit(ExprNode* node) = 0;\n    virtual void visit(StmtNode* node) = 0;\n    // ... visit methods for other nodes\n};\n\n// Rust to LLVM IR Generator\nclass RustToLLVMIRGenerator {\npublic:\n    RustAstVisitor* createVisitor() const { return new LLVMAstVisitorImpl(ctx, m); }\nprivate:\n    // LLVM IR context and module\n    LLVMContext ctx;\n    LLVM::Module* m;\n};\n\n// Rust AST Visitor\nclass RustAstVisitor {\npublic:\n    RustAstVisitor(LLVMAstVisitor* llvmVisitor) : llvmVisitor_(llvmVisitor) {}\n\n    void visit(AstNode* node) {\n        switch (node->kind) {\n            case Expr:\n                llvmVisitor_->visit(static_cast<ExprNode*>(node));\n                break;\n            case Stmt:\n                llvmVisitor_->visit(static_cast<StmtNode*>(node));\n                break;\n            // ... other types\n        }\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    LLVMAstVisitor* llvmVisitor_;\n};\n\n// LLVM IR Generator Implementation\nclass LLVMAstVisitorImpl : public LLVMAstVisitor {\npublic:\n    LLVMAstVisitorImpl(LLVMContext& ctx, LLVM::Module& m)\n        : llvmContext(ctx), module(m), builder(module.getOrInsertFunction(\"main\", FunctionType::getInt32Ty(llvmContext), {})) {}\n\n    // Override visit methods and generate LLVM IR\n    void visit(ExprNode* e) override {\n        // Generate IR based on the Expr Node type\n        generateIR(e);\n    }\n\n    void visit(StmtNode* s) override {\n        // Generate IR based on the Stmt Node type\n        generateIR(s);\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    LLVMContext& llvmContext;\n    LLVM::Module& module;\n    LLVM::Function* function;\n    LLVM::IRBuilder<> builder;\n};\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates the structure of the classes you'd need to create to transform Rust AST nodes into LLVM IR code. It's essential to adapt this structure according to your specific Rust AST structure, the LLVM IR type system, and handling any error conditions that may arise during the translation process.", "shortest_response": "Creating a C++ class that generates LLVM IR code from a Rust frontend grammar requires several steps and components. Unfortunately, it's impossible to provide a full implementation here. Instead, I'll outline the high-level steps and components you'll need.\n\n1.

Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)\n   - Generate an AST representation of the program, based on the rules defined by the parser.\n\n3. Visitor pattern\n   - Create a visitor pattern to traverse the AST and generate LLVM IR code.\n\n4. LLVM C++ API\n   - Make use of the LLVM C++ API to generate the IR code.\n\n5. Rust FFI bindings\n   - Write Rust FFI bindings to use the C++ code within Rust.\n\nHere's a high-level outline of the C++ class you might create:\n\n```cpp\n#include \"llvm/IR/LLVMContext.h\"\n#include \"llvm/IR/Module.h\"\n#include \"llvm/IR/IRBuilder.h\"\n\nclass LangIRGenerator {\npublic:\n    LangIRGenerator();\n    ~LangIRGenerator();\n\n    void generateIR(const ASTNode& node);\n\nprivate:\n    LLVMContext context;\n    Module *module;\n    IRBuilder<> builder;\n\n    // Visit functions for each AST node\n    void visitExpression(const ExpressionNode& node);\n    void visitBinaryExpression(const BinaryExpressionNode& node);\n    void visitAssignmentExpression(const AssignmentExpressionNode& node);\n    // Other visit functions for other nodes...\n};\n```\n\nYou would then need to implement the visit functions to translate the Rust AST nodes into LLVM IR. To use this class with Rust, write FFI bindings like this:\n\n```rust\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn initialize_lang_ir_gen() {\n    // Create and initialize the LangIRGenerator instance\n    // This might not be the best place for the initialization, but it shows the concept\n    let generator = LangIRGenerator::new();\n    // Store the instance for usage in Rust land\n    unsafe {\n        static LANG_IR_GEN: LangIRGenerator = generator;\n    }\n}\n\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn generate_ir_for_ast(ast: &ASTNode) {\n    let generator = unsafe { &LANG_IR_GEN };\n    generator.generateIR(*ast);\n}\n```", "input_size": 22, "output_sizes": [1006, 618, 1222, 796, 863, 838, 811, 637, 970, 705], "output_mean": 846.6, "output_std": 173.77, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 727.75, "p50": 824.5, "p75": 943.25, "p99": 1202.56}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 32.19317}, {"sample_id": "10698c32c6512de9", "prompt_id": "a790d2aaa82b4cee", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "I want to backtest stock market strategies using Python.

This is because PostgreSQL needs to check every row in the table to ensure that the column value is not NULL, and it does this during the actual execution of the `ALTER TABLE` command.\n\nFor tables with a `JSONB` column containing a lot of data, the process can be particularly slow because the check requires parsing the JSON data, which is an operation that can be time-consuming.\n\nTo mitigate the impact on performance, consider using the following strategies:\n\n1. **Incremental Approach:** Apply the constraint incrementally, by adding a new column with the `NOT NULL` constraint, then moving or replicating data from the old column to the new one. However, keep in mind that this approach might cause issues if there are concurrent writes to the table.\n\n2. **Offline Maintenance:** If possible, schedule the constraint modification as an offline maintenance activity, such as during a maintenance window or when there's low traffic.\n\n3. **Backup and Test:** Before making any major changes, always make a backup of your data and test the changes on a development or test environment first.\n\nHere's an example of adding a new column, making a check constraint, copying data, and then dropping the old column:\n\n```sql\nALTER TABLE your_table ADD new_jsonb_column JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}';\n\nCREATE FUNCTION check_not_null_jsonb() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$\nBEGIN\n    IF (NEW.new_jsonb_column IS NULL) THEN\n        RAISE EXCEPTION 'new_jsonb_column must not be null';\n    END IF;\n    RETURN NEW;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\nALTER TABLE your_table ADD CONSTRAINT check_new_jsonb_column CHECK (new_jsonb_column IS NOT NULL);\n\nCREATE TRIGGER trigger_check_not_null_jsonb BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON your_table FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE check_not_null_jsonb();\n\nCOPY (SELECT id, old_jsonb_column FROM your_table) TO '/tmp/your_data.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, FORMAT csv HEADER true);\n\nUPDATE your_table SET new_jsonb_column = old_jsonb_column WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM unnest(string_to_array('/tmp/your_data.csv', '\\n') FILTER (WHERE id IS NOT NULL)) id_list);\n\nDROP COLUMN old_jsonb_column FROM your_table;\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the existing table data is not changed during the operation and that any new incoming rows meet the `NOT NULL` constraint immediately. However, keep in mind that this method increases the required storage and locks concurrent writes during the update process.", "shortest_response": "Adding a `NOT NULL` constraint to an existing column in a large table (5 million rows) in PostgreSQL can indeed be slow due to the checks that need to be performed on all existing rows. Here's the process behind this operation:\n\n1. PostgreSQL checks if the existing data of the column respects the new constraint (`NOT NULL`).\n2. If any existing data is null, an error is raised, and you need to handle that situation separately (either providing a default value for the nulls or excluding those rows from the constraint).\n3. If all existing data is non-null, PostgreSQL adds the constraint to the table definition, but it does not modify the data itself.\n4. Whenever an attempt is made to insert or update a row with a null value in the column, a violation of the constraint will occur, and the operation will fail, preventing invalid data from being added.\n\nWhile the constraint checking phase can take some time for a large table, it is a one-time operation. After the constraint is added, standard inserts and updates should not be slowed down significantly. If you anticipate this operation to be too slow or potentially problematic for your application, you can consider temporarily disabling the constraint during bulk operations, re-enabling it afterward, and ensuring appropriate error handling when dealing with null values in the column.", "input_size": 45, "output_sizes": [471, 407, 452, 695, 330, 475, 368, 290, 442, 550], "output_mean": 448.0, "output_std": 109.4, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 377.75, "p50": 447.0, "p75": 474.0, "p99": 681.95}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 16.20709}, {"sample_id": "ef3718c5270948d2", "prompt_id": "74c5cc0093aa997a", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "female entrepreneur association", "longest_response": "Title: Empowering the Female Entrepreneur Association: A Comprehensive Guide\n\nIntroduction:\nIn today's dynamic business landscape, female entrepreneurs are making significant strides in various industries.

Instead, his assertion is more about the importance and relevance of consciousness within our understanding of the universe, rather than an inherent component from which the universe is formed or composed.\n\nBostrom's claim can be understood as arguing that consciousness is a vital aspect that should be accounted for in explaining the emergence and functioning of the universe, as it is an essential characteristic of certain physical systems (like human beings and potentially other intelligent entities). This is a philosophical stance, not a scientific one that describes the fundamental makeup of the universe like the theory of gravity.\n\nTo provide a bit more context, Bostrom is a proponent of the simulation argument, which proposes that there may be a significant number of post biological beings who run ancestor-simulations of their evolutionary history \u2013 ours included. In this context, consciousness is crucial as it is what gives rise to the subjective, qualitative aspects that we experience every day \u2013 something that Bostrom argues is vital to the survival and persistence of intelligent life as part of the simulation hypothesis.\n\nThat being said, the nature of consciousness and its relation to the universe is still an actively debated question in both philosophy and cognitive science, so this is a highly simplified summary of a complex and nuanced topic. For a more in-depth exploration, it's recommended to read Bostrom's works and the writings of other leading philosophers in this area.", "shortest_response": "Nick Bostrom, a philosopher known for his work on existential risk, artificial intelligence and the concept of the simulation hypothesis, does not generally claim that consciousness is a fundamental aspect of the universe in the same way that gravity or space-time are. However, in some of his philosophical arguments, he suggests that consciousness might be a fundamental feature of reality, meaning it is not reducible to physical processes, and plays a central role in our understanding of the universe, similar to how gravity and space-time do. This idea is often associated with philosophical positions called \"panpsychism\" or \"property dualism,\" which propose that consciousness is a fundamental property of all matter or that it exists in addition to physical properties. Bostrom's work on this topic is not extensive, so it is important to read his specific arguments for a clear understanding of his position.", "input_size": 25, "output_sizes": [235, 340, 194, 287, 253, 256, 237, 264, 326, 181], "output_mean": 257.3, "output_std": 48.21, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 235.5, "p50": 254.5, "p75": 281.25, "p99": 338.74}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 7.22468}, {"sample_id": "87d26f67ae6e7d04", "prompt_id": "76d3d1c45284c79d", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Web search results:\n\n[1] \"Production grade React applications that scale.

Violence in this case refers to communication induces fear, guilt and shame in the other person, instead of working with them to find a beneficial solution that satisfies everyone.\nAs such, NVC is focuses on the problem and the means to resolve it, rather than encouraging pointless power-plays (try to say that three times!) between people and thus prolonging conflict. NVC has been successfully applied to different situation, including educational, healthcare and organisational and business settings.\", and this dialouge \"1. Observations\nRULE: State factual observations about the situation that is affecting you.\nObservations are based on empirical facts, things you can identify with your five senses without adding personal judgements or evaluations.\nUsing the technique at work:\nFor example, \u2018Jim, it\u2019s Tuesday and your work was due yesterday\u2019 is an observation, whereas \u2018Jim you forgot to hand in your work in time\u2019 carries an assumption about the person\u2019s action. The latter statement is open to disagreement and an invitation for troublemongers to stir up conflict.\nUsing the technique at home:\nHere\u2019s the NVC technique in a parent-teenage scenario. We\u2019ll called our hypothetical teenager Sarah; she tends to be a bit careless sometimes\u2026 You know how they are at that age.\n\u2018Sarah, I noticed you left the towel on the bathroom floor this morning.\u2019\n2. Feelings\nRULE: State the feeling that the observation is triggering in you OR Guess what the other person is feeling, and ask.\nFeelings represent the emotional and physical response to any unmet needs that the observation made previously triggered. Feeling are not moral judgements.\nIn Jim\u2019s case, you could continue by saying:\n\u2018Jim, it\u2019s Tuesday and your work was due yesterday. (Observation) I feel disappointed. (Feeling)\u2019\nAlternatively,\n\u2018Jim, it\u2019s Tuesday and your work was due yesterday. (Observation) Are you reluctant to discuss this with me? (Feeling)\u2019\nBack to Sarah.\n\u2018Sarah, I noticed you left the towel on the bathroom floor this morning. (Observation) That bothers me. (Feeling)\u2018\n3. Needs\nRULE: State the need that is the cause of that feeling OR Guess the need that caused the feeling in the other person, and ask.\nIn the context of NVC, needs refer to common human experiences that are required for a fulfilled life. The American psychologist Abraham Maslow famously classified human needs in five categories: physiological, safety, belonging, esteem, and actualisation needs.\nTo continue with Jim\u2019s scenario:\n\u2018Jim, it\u2019s Tuesday and your work was due yesterday. (Observation) I feel disappointed (Feeling) because I trusted you to complete it in time. (Need)\u2019\nAlternatively,\n\u2018Jim, it\u2019s Tuesday and your work was due yesterday. (Observation) Are you reluctant to discuss this with me (Feeling) because you don\u2019t think I can understand your reasons for being late? (Need)\u2019\nIn Sarah\u2019s case:\n\u2018Sarah, I noticed you left the towel on the bathroom floor this morning. (Observation) That bothers me (Feeling) because I have to waste precious time picking your stuff. (Need)\u2018\n4. Requests\nRULE: Make a concrete request for action to meet the need just identified.\nIn order to meet our needs, we can make requests for cooperation with others by identifying and expressing a specific action that will serve this purpose, and then check with others involved about their willingness to participate in meeting our needs in this way.\nCue Jim.\n\u2018Jim, it\u2019s Tuesday and your work was due yesterday.

Or better, how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions? For example: Why is Apple so innovative? Year after year, after year, they're more innovative than all their competition. And yet, they're just a computer company. They're just like everyone else. They have the same access to the same talent, the same agencies, the same consultants, the same media. Then why is it that they seem to have something different? Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement? He wasn't the only man who suffered in pre-civil rights America, and he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day. Why him? And why is it that the Wright brothers were able to figure out controlled, powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified, better funded -- and they didn't achieve powered man flight, and the Wright brothers beat them to it. There's something else at play here.\n\n01:06\nAbout three and a half years ago, I made a discovery. And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked, and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it. As it turns out, there's a pattern. As it turns out, all the great inspiring leaders and organizations in the world, whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers, they all think, act and communicate the exact same way. And it's the complete opposite to everyone else. All I did was codify it, and it's probably the world's simplest idea. I call it the golden circle.\n\n01:56\nWhy? How? What? This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't. Let me define the terms really quickly. Every single person, every single organization on the planet knows what they do, 100 percent. Some know how they do it, whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your USP. But very, very few people or organizations know why they do what they do. And by \"why\" I don't mean \"to make a profit.\" That's a result. It's always a result. By \"why,\" I mean: What's your purpose? What's your cause? What's your belief? Why does your organization exist? Why do you get out of bed in the morning? And why should anyone care? As a result, the way we think, we act, the way we communicate is from the outside in, it's obvious. We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing. But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations -- regardless of their size, regardless of their industry -- all think, act and communicate from the inside out.\n\n03:02\nLet me give you an example. I use Apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets it. If Apple were like everyone else, a marketing message from them might sound like this: \"We make great computers. They're beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. Want to buy one?\" \"Meh.\" That's how most of us communicate. That's how most marketing and sales are done, that's how we communicate interpersonally. We say what we do, we say how we're different or better and we expect some sort of a behavior, a purchase, a vote, something like that. Here's our new law firm: We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients, we always perform for our clients. Here's our new car: It gets great gas mileage, it has leather seats. Buy our car. But it's uninspiring.\n\n03:49\nHere's how Apple actually communicates. \"Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. We just happen to make great computers. Want to buy one?\" Totally different, right? You're ready to buy a computer from me. I just reversed the order of the information. What it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do; people buy why you do it.\n\n04:24\nThis explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple. But we're also perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple, or a phone from Apple, or a DVR from Apple. As I said before, Apple's just a computer company. Nothing distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors. Their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products. In fact, they tried. A few years ago, Gateway came out with flat-screen TVs. They're eminently qualified to make flat-screen TVs. They've been making flat-screen monitors for years. Nobody bought one. Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs, and they make great quality products, and they can make perfectly well-designed products -- and nobody bought one. In fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine buying an MP3 player from Dell. Why would you buy one from a computer company? But we do it every day. People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have. The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe.\n\n05:36\nHere's the best part: None of what I'm telling you is my opinion. It's all grounded in the tenets of biology. Not psychology, biology. If you look at a cross-section of the human brain, from the top down, the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle. Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain, our neocortex, corresponds with the \"what\" level. The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language. The middle two sections make up our limbic brains, and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings, like trust and loyalty. It's also responsible for all human behavior, all decision-making, and it has no capacity for language.\n\n06:24\nIn other words, when we communicate from the outside in, yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures. It just doesn't drive behavior. When we can communicate from the inside out, we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior, and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do. This is where gut decisions come from. Sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures, and they say, \"I know what all the facts and details say, but it just doesn't feel right.\" Why would we use that verb, it doesn't \"feel\" right? Because the part of the brain that controls decision-making doesn't control language. The best we can muster up is, \"I don't know. It just doesn't feel right.\" Or sometimes you say you're leading with your heart or soul. I hate to break it to you, those aren't other body parts controlling your behavior. It's all happening here in your limbic brain, the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language.\n\n07:18\nBut if you don't know why you do what you do, and people respond to why you do what you do, then how will you ever get people to vote for you, or buy something from you, or, more importantly, be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do. The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe. The goal is not just to hire people who need a job; it's to hire people who believe what you believe. I always say that, you know, if you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money, but if they believe what you believe, they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears. Nowhere else is there a better example than with the Wright brothers.\n\n08:03\nMost people don't know about Samuel Pierpont Langley. And back in the early 20th century, the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day. Everybody was trying it. And Samuel Pierpont Langley had, what we assume, to be the recipe for success. Even now, you ask people, \"Why did your product or why did your company fail?\" and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things: under-capitalized, the wrong people, bad market conditions. It's always the same three things, so let's explore that. Samuel Pierpont Langley was given 50,000 dollars by the War Department to figure out this flying machine. Money was no problem. He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected; he knew all the big minds of the day. He hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic. The New York Times followed him around everywhere, and everyone was rooting for Langley. Then how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley?\n\n09:04\nA few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio, Orville and Wilbur Wright, they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success. They had no money; they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop. Not a single person on the Wright brothers' team had a college education, not even Orville or Wilbur. And The New York Times followed them around nowhere.\n\n09:27\nThe difference was, Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause, by a purpose, by a belief. They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine, it'll change the course of the world. Samuel Pierpont Langley was different. He wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous. He was in pursuit of the result. He was in pursuit of the riches. And lo and behold, look what happened. The people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears. The others just worked for the paycheck. They tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out, they would have to take five sets of parts, because that's how many times they would crash before supper.\n\n10:08\nAnd, eventually, on December 17th, 1903, the Wright brothers took flight, and no one was there to even experience it. We found out about it a few days later. And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing: the day the Wright brothers took flight, he quit. He could have said, \"That's an amazing discovery, guys, and I will improve upon your technology,\" but he didn't. He wasn't first, he didn't get rich, he didn't get famous, so he quit.\n\n10:39\nPeople don't", "longest_response": "El texto trata acerca de lo que explica que las cosas no suceden como se supone o c\u00f3mo se espera. El autor se\u00f1ala que existen personas y empresas que logran logros extraordinarios que podr\u00edan parecer desafiantes a las premisas, como por ejemplo, la innovaci\u00f3n de Apple o el liderazgo de Martin Luther King en el Movimiento por los Derechos Civiles. El autor afirma que all\u00ed se encuentra un patr\u00f3n en el que todos los grandes l\u00edderes inspiradores y organizaciones del mundo, como Apple, Martin Luther King y los hermanos Wright, piensan, act\u00faan y comunican de manera muy similar, en contra de la opini\u00f3n de la mayor\u00eda.

El autor define a \"Porque\" como la intenci\u00f3n o el prop\u00f3sito por detr\u00e1s de lo que uno hace o lo que una organizaci\u00f3n realiza. El objetivo es inspirar, en lugar de vender solo a los que necesitan su producto. El autor argumenta que en el enfoque de 'Porque', 'C\u00f3mo', 'Qu\u00e9' todos nuestros pensamientos, acciones y forma de comunicarnos es de 'afuera hacia adentro'. Mientras que los l\u00edderes inspiradores piensan, act\u00faan y comunican desde 'adentro hacia afuera'. El autor da el ejemplo de Apple, ya que es f\u00e1cil de entender y aprobar por la mayor\u00eda.\n\nLuego el autor se\u00f1ala que si Apple se comportaba como otras empresas, su descripci\u00f3n su comunicaci\u00f3n podr\u00eda parecer as\u00ed: \u201cTenemos los mejores computadores. Son beautifulmente dise\u00f1ados, sencillos en usar y usuario-friendly. \u00bfQuieres comprar uno?\u201d Mientras que la forma en que Apple realmente comunica su idea ser\u00eda: \u201cTodo lo que hacemos, creemos en desafiar el estatus quo. Creemos en pensar de manera diferente. Las maneras en que desafiamos el estatus quo consisten en hacer nuestros productos beautifulmente dise\u00f1ados, sencillos en usar, y user-friendly. Solo por casualidad hacemos los mejores computadores. \u00bfQuieres comprar uno?\" El autor argumenta que cuando se comunica de manera clara el por qu\u00e9 la gente est\u00e1 m\u00e1s dispuesta a comprar su producto, no solo un computador, sino otros art\u00edculos como MP3, tel\u00e9fonos o DVD, ya que todos son de la misma empresa. Apple es una empresa de computadoras, nada m\u00e1s.\n\nEn resumen, el autor se\u00f1ala que cuando se comunica desde el interior hacia afuera, se inspira a los clientes en lugar de simplemente venderles un producto.

Una idea central es que la gente no compra lo que hacen, sino por qu\u00e9 lo hacen.

Implement the black hole model:\n   - Create a new Swift file called \"BlackHole.swift\" and add the following code:\n\n```swift\nimport SceneKit\n\nfunc createBlackHole() -> SCNNode {\n    let blackHole = SCNSphere(radius: 1)\n    blackHole.firstMaterial?.diffuse.contents = UIColor.black\n    blackHole.firstMaterial?.specular.contents = UIColor(white: 0.5, alpha: 1.0)\n    blackHole.firstMaterial?.specularPower = 50\n    blackHole.firstMaterial?.Emission.contents = UIColor.white\n\n    let blackHoleMass = SCNVector3(0, 0, 0)\n    let gravityConstant = -6.6743e-11 // gravity constant (m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u00b2)\n\n    let forceField = SCNFloorGrid(width: 20, depth: 20)\n    forceField.firstMaterial?.diffuse.contents = UIColor.clear\n    forceField.isAntialiasingEnabled = true\n\n    let blackHoleNode = SCNNode()\n    blackHoleNode.geometry = blackHole\n    blackHoleNode.position = SCNVector3(x: 0, y: 0, z: 5)\n    blackHoleNode.addChildNode(forceField)\n\n    // Calculate and add the gravitational force to the nodes in the scene\n    let calculateGravitationalForce = { (node: SCNNode, force: SCNVector3) in\n        let distance = node.position.distance(to: blackHoleNode.position)\n\n        // Implement Newton's law of universal gravitation in 3D using SceneKit's built-in physics functions\n        let gravitationalForce = force * (gravityConstant * blackHoleMass.magnitude * node.mass / (distance * distance))\n\n        let gravitationalForceNode = SCNNode()\n        gravitationalForceNode.physicsBody = SCNPhysicsBody(type: .static, shape: nil)\n        gravitationalForceNode.position = blackHoleNode.position + gravitationalForce.normalized() * (distance + blackHole.radius * 2)\n        gravitationalForceNode.physicsBody?.applyForce(gravitationalForce, asImpulse: true)\n        gravitationalForceNode.eulerAngles = SCNVector3(0, -CLM_PI_2, 0)\n        blackHoleNode.addChildNode(gravitationalForceNode)\n\n        node.addChildNode(SCNTextNode(string: \"\\(node.name) (\\(node.mass) kg)\", charsPerLine: 1))\n    }\n\n    // Create some sample nodes with masses\n    let asteroid1 = SCNSphere(radius: 0.1)\n    asteroid1.firstMaterial?.diffuse.contents = UIColor.gray\n    let asteroid2 = SCNSphere(radius: 0.2)\n    asteroid2.firstMaterial?.diffuse.contents = UIColor.brown\n    let asteroid3 = SCNSphere(radius: 0.05)\n    asteroid3.firstMaterial?.diffuse.contents = UIColor.red\n\n    let asteroid1Node = SCNNode(geometry: asteroid1)\n    asteroid1Node.position = SCNVector3(x: 1, y: 0, z: 0)\n    asteroid1Node.mass = 100\n    calculateGravitationalForce(asteroid1Node, SCNVector3(-20, 0, 0))\n\n    let asteroid2Node = SCNNode(geometry: asteroid2)\n    asteroid2Node.position = SCNVector3(x: -1, y: 0, z: -3)\n    asteroid2Node.mass = 500\n    calculateGravitationalForce(asteroid2Node, SCNVector3(-20, 0, 0))\n\n    let asteroid3Node = SCNNode(geometry: asteroid3)\n    asteroid3Node.position = SCNVector3(x: 0, y: 2, z: 0)\n    asteroid3Node.mass = 10\n    calculateGravitationalForce(asteroid3Node, SCNVector3(-20, 0, 0))\n\n    // Add all asteroids to the scene\n    blackHoleNode.addChildNode(asteroid1Node)\n    blackHoleNode.addChildNode(asteroid2Node)\n    blackHoleNode.addChildNode(asteroid3Node)\n\n    return blackHoleNode\n}\n```\n\n5. Update the accretion disk configuration in `ContentView.swift`:\n   - Add the following imports and variables to `ContentView`:\n\n```swift\nimport simd\nimport QuartzCore\n\nlet accretionRadius = 3\nlet accretionHeight = 0.3\nlet accretionSegments = 64\nlet accretionTexture = UIImage(named: \"accretion_disk_texture\")\n```\n\n- Add a custom `accretionDisk()` function that generates the accretion disk in `ContentView.swift`:\n\n```swift\nfunc createAccretionDisk() -> SCNNode {\n    func createRingSegment(angleRange: Float, radius: Float) -> SCNShape {\n        let points = (0..<accretionSegments)\n            .map { i in\n                let t = Float(i) / Float(accretionSegments)\n                let x = cos(angleRange + 2 * Float.pi * t) * radius\n                let z = sin(angleRange + 2 * Float.pi * t) * radius\n                return SCNVector3(x, 0, z)\n            }\n\n        // Use a quad for performance reasons and to avoid the appearance of flat-shaded polygons\n        let quadIndices = (0..<accretionSegments)\n            .flatMap { i in\n                let next = (i + 1) % accretionSegments\n                return [i, next, next + accretionSegments, i + accretionSegments, i, i + accretionSegments]\n            }\n\n        let ringShape = SCNShape(ringsAndSegmentsArray: [(points, quadIndices)])\n        return ringShape\n    }\n\n    let innerRadius = accretionRadius - (accretionHeight / 2)\n    let outerRadius = accretionRadius + (accretionHeight / 2)\n\n    let diskGeometry = SCNGeometrySource(values: accretionRadius.map {\n        ($0, 0, 0)\n    }, vectors: [\n        CPAffineTransformMakeRotation(CLM_HALF_PI, 0, 1, 0)\n            .translateBy(x: 0, y: accretionHeight / 2, z: 0)\n            .concatenating(CATransform3DMakeRotation(CLM_PI, 0, 0, -1))\n            .concatenating(CATransform3DMakeRotation(accretionAngle, 1, 0, 0))\n            .concatenating(CATransform3DMakeTranslation(0, 0, -accretionHeight / 2))\n            .matrix\n    ].map { mat in SCNVector3(mat[0], mat[5], mat[10]) },\n        toFormat: .cgVertex3Normal)\n\n    let diskMaterial = SCNMaterial()\n    diskMaterial.diffuse.contents = accretionTexture\n    diskMaterial.lightingModel = SCNLightingModelConstant\n\n    let accretionDiskGeometry = SCNGeometry(sources: [diskGeometry], elements: nil)\n    let accretionDiskNode = SCNNode(geometry: accretionDiskGeometry)\n    accretionDiskNode.firstMaterial = diskMaterial\n\n    return accretionDiskNode\n}\n```\n\n6. Update `ContentView.swift` to include the black hole, accretion disk, and camera configuration:\n   - Modify the `makeUIView()` method in `ContentView` to initialize the scene, add the black hole, accretion disk, lights, and camera:\n\n```swift\nfunc makeUIView(context: Context) -> SCNView {\n    let scene = SCNScene()\n\n    // Add black hole\n    let blackHoleNode = createBlackHole()\n    scene.rootNode.addChildNode(blackHoleNode)\n\n    // Add accretion disk\n    let accretionDiskNode = createAccretionDisk()\n    accretionDiskNode.eulerAngles = SCNVector3(0, -CLM_PI_2, 0)\n    scene.rootNode.addChildNode(accretionDiskNode)\n\n    // Add lights\n    let ambientLight = SCNLight()\n    ambientLight.type = .ambient\n    ambientLight.color = UIColor(white: 0.3, alpha: 1.0)\n    scene.lights += [ambientLight]\n\n    let directionalLight = SCNLight()\n    directionalLight.type = .directional\n    directionalLight.color = UIColor.white\n    directionalLight.direction = SCNVector3(0, -1, 0)\n    scene.lights += [directionalLight]\n\n    // Configure camera\n    let cameraNode = SCNCamera()\n    cameraNode.lookingAtPath = [blackHoleNode.position]\n    cameraNode.position = SCNVector3(x: 0, y: 10, z: 10)\n    scene.rootNode.addChildNode(cameraNode)\n\n    let sceneView = SCNView(frame: context.coordinator.parent.sceneView.frame)\n    sceneView.scene = scene\n    sceneView.autoenablesDefaultLighting = true\n    sceneView.allowsCameraControl = true\n    sceneView.showsStatistics = false\n    return sceneView\n}\n```\n\n7. Run the app:\n   - Press the play button, and you should see a black hole model with simple physics and an accretion disk swirling around it.\n\n8. Implement the gravitational lens effect (this is beyond the scope of this guide, as it requires advanced 3D math and physics, and custom visualizations).\n\n9. Adjust the settings as needed for performance optimization, and improve the model, effect, and interactions to create your desired black hole simulation. Happy coding!", "shortest_response": "To create a pseudo-3D model of a black hole with an accretion disk and gravitational lensing effect using SwiftUI, SceneKit, and a physics engine, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up the Xcode project and create the SwiftUI view.**\n   - Create a new Xcode project in SwiftUI App template.\n   - Import SceneKit, CoreMotion, and SwiftUI in your main App.swift file.\n   - Create a new SwiftUI View for your SceneKit scene.\n\n2. **Create the SceneKit scene and its entities.**\n   - In your SwiftUI view, create a `SCNView` and set its delegate to your view controller class.\n   - In the view controller class, initialize the `SCNScene`, ` rootNode`, and cameraNode.\n   - Create an `SCNSphere` for the black hole. You can manually set its radius, materials, and other properties.\n\n3. **Create the accretion disk.**\n   - Create a custom `SCNNode` subclass to represent the accretion disk. It should be a ring-shaped geometry with a material mimicking a disk's appearance.\n   - Use a `SCNCylinder` or `SCNTorus` depending on the desired shape of the accretion disk. Create vertices and set up the vertices and indices to create the ring.\n   - Alternatively, you can use a 3D model file of an accretion disk if you find one online.\n\n4. **Animate the accretion disk.**\n   - To create a swirling motion, create an animation keyframe for the rotate action along the y-axis using `SCNAction.rotateBy` and `SCNAction.repeatForever`.\n   - Use `SCNNode.runAction` to animate the accretion disk nodes.\n\n5. **Setup the gravitational lensing.**\n   - Create another `SCNSphere` that represents the light bending gravity effect. Position it off-screen and adjust its radius to create the desired bending effect.\n   - You can use a combination of radii, positions, and angles to achieve the gravitational lensing effect. Experiment to get the desired appearance.\n\n6. **Lighting and other scene settings.**\n   - Set up ambient and directional lights in your scene to create a suitable environment for your black hole and accretion disk.\n   - Adjust the camera's position, orientation, and distance to create a perspective that showcases your black hole and accretion disk effectively.\n\n7. **Update the SceneKit scene in SwiftUI as needed.**\n   - Whenever you want to update the black hole, accretion disk, or lensing effects, call the appropriate methods in your SceneKit view controller from your SwiftUI view.\n\n8. **Implement the physics engine.**\n   - To simulate the black hole's gravitational pull, you can use SceneKit's built-in physics engine. Create collision shapes and constraints for the black hole and accretion disk.\n   - Apply the gravity force of the black hole to other objects or particles in the scene using `SCNNode.physicsBody?.applyForce(_:)`.\n   - You can also use third-party libraries like SIMD physics engine for more complex physics simulations if needed.\n\n9. **Test and iterate.**\n   - Run your app on a device or simulator to test your black hole, accretion disk, and gravitational lensing effects.\n   - Iterate on your design, adding more polish, effects, or features as desired.", "input_size": 162, "output_sizes": [1442, 1509, 1703, 1662, 802, 828, 1923, 1442, 3142, 1910], "output_mean": 1636.3, "output_std": 622.13, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 1442.0, "p50": 1585.5, "p75": 1858.25, "p99": 3032.29}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 126.48448}, {"sample_id": "601c7dacc461b038", "prompt_id": "ddde0eb637b3052e", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Instructions:\n\nYou are required to use a Microsoft Excel document to prepare the budget calculation for the launching event of the New Committee Members of the Staff Club that your company has planned.

A city that, despite its grandeur and inventiveness, bears the scars of its own progress, revealing a stark and unsettling duality that echoes the very essence of its industrious soul.\n\nThe city's skyline, a breathtaking spectacle of brass, iron, and steam, is a testament to the ceaseless innovations that have led to the development of unparalleled marvels. Towering clockworks pierce the smoggy sky, each tick and tock resonating like a heartbeat across the city. The air is filled with the sights and sounds of inventions both bizarre and wondrous - steam-powered carriages that defy gravity, steam-whistling airships that dwarf the buildings below, and intricate automatons performing tasks ranging from menial labor to the most complex computations.\n\nThe vibrant quarter of Cogsworth's Cradle, known as Invention's Alley, is a microcosm of human ingenuity and mechanical artistry. Here, craftsmen and inventors labor tirelessly in their cog-and-steam-fueled workshops, their eyes glowing with a mix of determination and madness as they create devices that push the boundaries of what is deemed possible. The alley is a hive of activity, where ideas are traded and bartered like coins, and the promise of the next great invention fuels the relentless pursuit of progress.\n\nYet beneath this veneer of wondrous inventiveness, another facet of Cogsworth's Cradle reveals itself - a dark, dirty side that is all too easily forgotten amidst the shiny brass and gleaming gears. The city's underbelly, a labyrinth of narrow, dimly lit alleyways, is home to the less fortunate souls who eke out a living amidst the grime and filth that accumulates in the cracks and crevices left behind by the city's ceaseless march towards progress.\n\nThe air here is thick with the scent of oil and soot, and the sound of steam engines is replaced with the cacophony of clattering machinery and the desperate cries of the oppressed. Children as young as five scavenge through the city's waste, searching for salvageable parts amidst the rusted gears and broken steam-powered limbs. The workers of the factories, their flesh stained black from years of exposure to the grime and soot, labor for pitiful wages, their bodies aching from the exhausting, unrewarding toil.\n\nThe inhabitants of Cogsworth's Cradle are a diverse lot, each with their own stories, their own dreams, and their own secrets. There are the wealthy aristocrats who reside in their grand, steam-powered mansions, oblivious to the suffering that lies just beyond their well-guarded doors. There are the inventors and artists, driven by their passion for creation and beauty, who strive to make a difference amidst the chaos and despair. And there are the schemers and tricksters, who manipulate the system to their own advantage, their sly smiles and insidious whispers seeping into the very fabric of the city.\n\nLife in Cogsworth's Cradle is a tenuous balance, a delicate dance upon the razor's edge that separates progress from ruin. The city's inhabitants must learn to navigate the complex web of power, greed, and ambition that weaves through the streets like a hidden current, affecting every aspect of their lives. They must forge alliances, make sacrifices, and often, compromise their principles if they wish to survive.\n\nYet, amongst the darkness and despair, there is a glimmer of hope. For it is in the heart of the city, amidst the grime and the muck, that the next great invention is born - a beacon of light in the darkness, a testament to the indomitable human spirit. And it is in this glimmer of hope, this relentless pursuit of progress, that the people of Cogsworth's Cradle find the strength to carry on, to dare to dream, and to believe that, one day, their city might rise above the shadows and truly become a beacon of enlightenment and innovation.\n\nThe city of Cogsworth's Cradle, with its wondrous inventions and its dark, dirty underbelly, is a living, breathing emblem of the eternal struggle between progress and decay, order and chaos, light and darkness. It is a crucible where dreams are forged, where fortunes are made and lost, and where the fates of countless souls are forever intertwined. And it is a testament to the power of human ingenuity - a power that can create marvels and monstrosities, that can shape worlds and change the course of history, and that can, quite literally, change the face of time itself.", "shortest_response": "Title: Steampunk Metropolis: Cogs and Chimneys\n\nIn the heart of the vast Expanse, where the sun rarely shines and the air hums with an unseen symphony of gears and metal, lies the magnificent city of New Veridium. A bastion of human ingenuity, New Veridium stands as a testament to mankind's relentless pursuit of progress, balanced precariously between the wondrous inventive side and the dark, dirty side of the steampunk revolution.\n\nNew Veridium's skyline is a breathtaking amalgamation of brass and iron architecture, reaching towards the sky like the branches of a metallic tree. Each building is a grand spectacle, decked with intricate cogs, steam-powered clocks, and glass domes that emit a gentle glow in the moonlight. The city's streets are awash with vibrant, mechanized carriages, whisking its denizens through the streets in a whirlwind of motion.\n\nAt the heart of this marvel lies the Great Inventors' Expo. A place where the city's most brilliant minds gather to display their latest creations, from automatons that can think and feel to airships that defy gravity. It is here that dreams are born and the future of New Veridium is shaped.\n\nYet, beneath the polished brass and the gleaming steam, the city hides a darker truth. The factories that power New Veridium are fueled by the sweat and toil of the less fortunate. The Lower Spires, a vast network of slums inhabited by the city's underclass, are riddled with crumbling buildings, filthy streets, and the ever-present stench of industrial waste.\n\nThe air in the Lower Spires is thick with soot and the clanging of machinery echoes through the narrow, winding alleys. Its inhabitants toil away in the factories, their bodies worn down by the relentless, unforgiving machines that leave no room for error or compassion. The streets are ruled by gangs, who exploit the desperate for their own gain.\n\nDespite this, there are those who fight for change, who dare to dream of a better city. The Resistance, a clandestine organization of revolutionary thinkers, plans to overthrow the corrupt hierarchy that keeps the Lower Spires in its grim grip. They dream of a New Veridium where innovation and morality walk hand in hand, where the city's incredible progress benefits all its people, not just the privileged few.\n\nAs the sun sets over this steampunk metropolis, casting long shadows over the cobblestone streets, it is impossible not to be in awe of New Veridium's beauty and ingenuity. Yet, it is also impossible not to feel a twinge of sorrow for the city's oppressed, a longing for the day when the wondrous inventive side and the dark, dirty side of this incredible city come together, united under a banner of progress, compassion, and equality.", "input_size": 26, "output_sizes": [854, 963, 942, 674, 865, 726, 1156, 853, 956, 827], "output_mean": 881.6, "output_std": 127.77, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 833.5, "p50": 859.5, "p75": 952.5, "p99": 1138.63}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 30.03605}, {"sample_id": "de63b44dccf7247a", "prompt_id": "6d214622ff8a2d24", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Explain Bitcoin", "longest_response": "Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.

They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.\n\nThe appeal of Bitcoin comes from the fact that it promises to provide a number of advantages over traditional fiat currencies, including:\n\n1. Decentralization: Unlike traditional currencies that are issued and controlled by central banks, Bitcoin is decentralized. This means that it is not subject to manipulation or influence by any single entity.\n2. Privacy: Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, meaning that they are not linked to the identities of the parties involved. This provides a degree of privacy for users.\n3. Security: Bitcoin uses advanced cryptography to secure transactions and protect users' funds. This makes it difficult for hackers to steal or counterfeit coins.\n4. Limited supply: There is a limit of 21 million Bitcoins that can ever be mined. This scarcity is expected to drive up the value of Bitcoin over time.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin is also subject to several criticisms and risks, including:\n\n1. Volatility: The value of Bitcoin can fluctuate wildly, making it a risky investment. This is due in part to the fact that the market for Bitcoin is relatively small and the demand for it is not well understood.\n2. Lack of regulation: Because Bitcoin is not issued or controlled by any central bank, it is not subject to the same regulations as traditional currencies. This can make it difficult for governments to track and prevent illegal activities, such as money laundering and tax evasion.\n3. Technical complexities: Bitcoin requires a high degree of technical knowledge to use and maintain. This can be a barrier for many potential users.\n4. Energy consumption: The process of mining Bitcoin consumes a large amount of energy, which has been a source of criticism.\n\nIn summary, Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that is created through a process called mining and can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services.

Let's start our regular EA meeting. I'd like to begin by going around the table and hearing updates from each of you regarding your current projects and any challenges you are facing. Chas, shall we start with you?\n\n(Chas) Hello, Bradford. In my last meeting with the marketing team, we identified a need for a unified customer data model to improve data consistency across different platforms. But we are facing some difficulties with integrating our existing data structures without disrupting the current operations.\n\n(B) Thanks for the update, Chas. Kevin, can you share your progress on the cloud migration project?\n\n(Kevin) Hi, Bradford. We are making good progress, but we encountered some issues related to data security and compliance regulations. We are working on figuring out the best approach to ensure that all data is securely transferred to the cloud while maintaining compliance.\n\n(B) Alright, keep us posted on that. Terry, what's new on the IT infrastructure front?\n\n(Terry) Our focus has been on upgrading the network infrastructure to support faster data transfer rates and accommodate future growth initiatives. We are currently working on the design phase and expect to start the implementation soon.\n\n(B) Great, sounds like a crucial project. Dalton, are there any updates from the software development team?\n\n(Dalton) Hi, Bradford. Our team is working on a microservices architecture for our new suite of productivity apps. We've made good progress, but we're facing challenges with ensuring seamless integration across the different services.\n\n(B) It's important to get that right, Dalton. Are there any potential solutions or best practices you've come across that could help us tackle this issue?\n\n(Dalton) I did attend a conference session on service mesh architectures, which might help us address the integration challenges. I'd be happy to share more details with the team.\n\n(B) That's a great initiative, Dalton. Viral, would you like to discuss the progress on our AI and machine learning projects?\n\n(Viral) Hi, Bradford. We are currently working on implementing AI models for predictive maintenance and customer support. Some of the challenges we are facing are related to data quality and the need for a centralized AI platform.\n\n(B) It's important to address those issues effectively, considering the benefits AI can bring to our business. Let's schedule a dedicated meeting to discuss AI strategy further and explore potential solutions to the challenges you've mentioned.\n\n(Chas) That sounds like a good idea, Bradford. It would be useful to gather all relevant stakeholders to brainstorm strategies and identify best practices to address these challenges.\n\n(B) I agree. Let's schedule that meeting for next week and ensure that everyone who needs to be involved is aware and ready to participate. This will allow us to collaboratively approach the challenges and come up with robust solutions.\n\n(All) Agreed!\n\n(B) Alright, let's move on to our action items for this week and then we can wrap up the meeting. Chas, you have an action item regarding the customer data model, correct?\n\n(Chas) Yes, Bradford. I will be reaching out to the data governance team to discuss the unified customer data model and gather their input on potential solutions for integrating the existing data structures.\n\n(B) Great. Kevin, your action item involves researching data security best practices and regulatory compliance requirements.\n\n(Kevin) I've started working on that already and will be presenting a summary of my findings at our upcoming cloud migration meeting.\n\n(B) Alright. Terry, can you remind everyone about the upcoming network infrastructure upgrade and share the intended timeline?\n\n(Terry) Absolutely, Bradford. I'll prepare an update for our next meeting, including the timeline and any potential impact on other teams.\n\n(B) Thanks, Terry. Dalton, please share your findings from the conference session on service mesh architectures with the team by the end of this week.\n\n(Dalton) I will do that, Bradford.\n\n(B) Great. And Viral, could you please arrange a meeting with the relevant stakeholders for the AI strategy discussion we've mentioned earlier?\n\n(Viral) I will arrange that meeting, Bradford. The goal is to set it up for next week, as suggested.\n\n(B) Perfect. I'd like to wrap up the meeting now, but before we conclude, does anyone have any other topics or updates they'd like to discuss?\n\n(Chas) I have one more thing, Bradford. It's related to the customer data model. I've been discussing the idea of a data lake with some colleagues, and they feel it could be an effective solution for managing our diverse data sources. I'd like to explore this further as an alternative to the unified data model we initially discussed.\n\n(B) That's a good point, Chas. Let's spend some time in the next week researching and discussing the merits of implementing a data lake versus the unified data model. We can revisit the decision at our next meeting if necessary.\n\n(All) Agreed.\n\n(B) Thank you all for your great work and contributions to today's meeting. I'll schedule the follow-up meetings accordingly, and I look forward to our continued collaboration in the weeks ahead.\n\n(All) Thank you, Bradford.

Let's dive right in.\n\n**Chas**: Alright, Bradford. I've been working on our cloud migration strategy. I believe we should consider adopting a hybrid approach, integrating our existing on-premises systems with cloud services.\n\n**Kevin**: I agree with Chas. However, we need to make sure we address potential security concerns when dealing with both environments simultaneously.\n\n**Terry**: Definitely. Security is paramount when considering any kind of infrastructure changes. We should also consider implementing a zero-trust model to minimize risks.\n\n**Dalton**: That sounds like a solid plan. I'd like to take a look at our current systems integration framework as well, to ensure a smooth migration process.\n\n**Viral**: Speaking of systems integration, I've been working on the API management improvements and have a proposed solution for better handling microservices communications across the enterprise.\n\n**Bradford**: Excellent, Viral. Please share your thoughts with the group, and we can discuss how it fits into our overall architecture strategy.\n\n[The team discusses Viral's API management proposal in detail, asking questions, discussing pros, and cons, and brainstorming solutions to potential issues.]\n\n**Chas**: Alright, before we wrap up, I'd like to touch on the data governance policies we've been discussing. Let's make sure we have a comprehensive plan in place to manage and secure our data effectively.\n\n**Terry**: I second that. We need to address the data protection regulations for our respective geographical territories as well.\n\n**Kevin**: And we should also consider implementing data lineage to ensure traceability and improve our compliance efforts.\n\n**Dalton**: I've drafted an initial outline for the data governance strategy. I'll send it to the team this afternoon for feedback.\n\n**Bradford**: Great. Let's reconvene at our next meeting to discuss progress on these topics.

One day, she received a message from the town on the other side of a steep mountain, asking for help. A big train full of toys was stuck, and no engine was big or strong enough to help them.\n\nTara, though small, knew that her strength came from within. But this time, she approached the challenge differently - with the principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in her little piston-like heart.\n\nFirst, Tara acknowledged that this was a difficult task - a mountain was indeed steep, and she was rather small. But she also realized that by focusing on her limitations, she would only fuel negative emotions. Instead, she accepted the reality of the situation, understanding it was human to feel discomfort but choosing not to let it hold her back.\n\nSecondly, Tara identified her personal values \u2013 helping others and persevering in the face of challenges. She remembered a wise coach who once told her, \"You can't control the world, but you can control how you react to it.\" So, she focused on her actions - not on the mountain or the train, but on the small steps she could take to reach her goals.\n\nThe train conductor asked, \"Can you pull this train up the mountain, Little Tara?\" Tara hesitated, remembering the importance of self-compassion in ACT. \"Oh, Conductor,\" she said, \"I may not be the strongest engine, but I am capable and determined. Let's focus on what I can do rather than what I can't.\"\n\nWith each step up the mountain, Tara repeated her mantra: \"I can do this,\" but with a new understanding. Rather than hoping to magically become stronger, she acknowledged her doubts, fears, and discomfort but committed herself to moving forward courageously \u2013 one step, one breath, one revolution at a time.\n\nAs Tara climbed the mountain, she noticed a forest filled with flowers. She paused to appreciate the beauty, choosing to savor the present moment rather than dwelling on the challenge ahead. She remembered another valuable lesson from her coach: \"Catch yourself pulling away when you get stressed, and gently refocus on what's right in front of you.\"\n\nFinally, after struggling up the steep hill, Tara reached the top! The town erupted in cheers as toys, games, and laughter spilled out from the train. Tara felt an immense sense of pride and fulfillment, knowing she had challenged herself and come out stronger on the other side.\n\nFrom then on, whenever Tara encountered a difficult task, she would remember the mountain and the lessons she learned.

The conductor, worried about the children who would miss out on their presents, asked a small engine named Daisy to pull their train over the mountain. Daisy was the smallest and weakest engine, but with a kind heart, she agreed.\n\nAs she started up the mountain, she felt the strain on her tiny engine. She knew she was not equipped to handle the task. But instead of giving up or letting her fears hold her back, Daisy decided to approach the challenge with mindfulness and acceptance.\n\nShe repeated to herself, \"I accept that I am struggling right now.\" She acknowledged her feelings of doubt and fear, but she also reminded herself that everyone experiences hardships. It was not a sign of weakness, but a chance to learn and grow.\n\nShe climbed higher and higher, and with each pull, she said, \"I am exactly where I need to be right now.\" She focused on the present moment, taking small steps and breathing deeply, remembering that the journey was more important than the destination.\n\nAs she neared the peak, she encountered another engine named Bella, who had previously failed to pull the train over the mountain. Bella felt defeated and anxious about attempting the task again. Daisy empathized with her feelings and shared her newfound mindful approach.\n\nBella, inspired by Daisy, decided to give it another try using the principles of acceptance and mindfulness. Together, they climbed the mountain, supporting each other through the challenges. When they reached the top, the two engines celebrated their strength and perseverance.\n\nIn the end, Daisy and Bella taught the other trains that it's not about being the strongest or the fastest, but about embracing the struggles and finding inner strength through acceptance and mindfulness. And the children, who received their toys, learned a valuable lesson about resilience and the power of a kind heart.\n\nThe end.", "input_size": 29, "output_sizes": [534, 644, 521, 641, 613, 446, 459, 638, 535, 521], "output_mean": 555.2, "output_std": 70.58, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 521.0, "p50": 534.5, "p75": 631.75, "p99": 643.73}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 14.71294}, {"sample_id": "00d3999a7ba7cbbc", "prompt_id": "88bdf5d7e2cd2332", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "how to write citations properly?", "longest_response": "To write citations properly, you need to follow a specific citation style, such as APA, MLA, or Chicago, depending on your academic or professional requirements.

The `enumerate()` function returns a tuple containing the index and the value for each item in the iterable, making it convenient to access both index and item in the for loop.\n\nWith Python 3.10 and later, you can use the `for-await` syntax along with an asynchronous generator to simplify things further:\n\n```python\nasync def my_async_iterator(my_list):\n    for item in my_list:\n        await asyncio.sleep(0)  # Simulate latency between iterations\n        yield item\n\nasync def main():\n    async for item in my_async_iterator(my_list) if index := my_async_iterator.__aiter__().__next__() + 1:\n        if index != len(my_list):\n            print(item)\n\n# Make sure to run this asynchronously\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nIn this example, an asynchronous iterator is created, and the `for-await` loop only processes iterations except the last one using the same approach as before (incrementing the index and comparing it with the length of the list).\n\nNote that the example above uses async/await syntax, which is available in Python 3.7 and later. If you're using an earlier version of Python, you can use a simple generator and the `itertools.islice()` function instead:\n\n```python\ndef my_generator(my_list):\n    for item in my_list:\n        yield item\n\nfor item in islice(my_generator(my_list), 1, None):\n    print(item)\n```\n\nThis technique takes an iterable (such as a list), generates an iterator over it, and then removes the first element using `islice()`.

The DMA test is used to characterize the storage modulus (elastic response), loss modulus (viscous response), and damping behavior (tan delta) of a material over a wide range of temperatures and frequencies.\n\nThe process of performing a DMA test on a composite material can be described as follows:\n\n1. Sample Preparation: The composite material is prepared in the form of a suitable specimen, such as a cylinder, disc, or rectangular shape, suitable for the DMA machine. The specimen is typically clamped or fixed in the DMA apparatus.\n\n2. Temperature and Frequency Sweep: The DMA machine subjects the specimen to a controlled temperature and frequency sweep. The temperature range can span from room temperature to elevated temperatures, and the frequency range can be from millihertz to megahertz. The temperature and frequency sweeps help to analyze the material's response over a wide range of conditions.\n\n3. Analysis Modes: There are two primary analysis modes in DMA: dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and dynamic mechanical spectroscopy (DMS). DMTA characterizes the material's response as a function of both temperature and frequency, while DMS focuses on the frequency-dependent behavior at a fixed temperature.\n\n4. Measurement of Properties: As the specimen is subjected to an oscillatory deformation, the machine measures the storage modulus (elastic response), loss modulus (viscous response), and tan delta (damping behavior). The changes in these properties as a function of temperature and frequency provide insights into the molecular structure, relaxation, and glass transition temperature of the composite material.\n\n5. Data Interpretation: The data obtained from the DMA test is presented in the form of plots, such as storage modulus vs. loss modulus, loss modulus vs. temperature, and tan delta vs. temperature. These plots can help in understanding the material's physical properties, such as the glass transition temperature (Tg), transition range, and the presence of any secondary transitions.\n\nIn conclusion, the DMA test plays a crucial role in studying the viscoelastic properties of composite materials, as it helps in understanding the molecular structure and the behavior of the materials under various conditions. The information acquired from the DMA test is valuable for optimizing the design, simulation, and production of composite materials in various industries, including aerospace, automotive, and construction.", "shortest_response": "DMA (Dynamic Mechanical Analysis) is an important test in the characterization of composites, polymers, and other materials. It provides valuable information about the material's viscoelastic properties, which are crucial for understanding its behavior under various load and temperature conditions, especially when those conditions involve dynamic, time-dependent loading.\n\nThe DMA test measures the storage modulus (G'), loss modulus (G''), and the tangent delta (tan delta = G'' / G') of a material as it undergoes a small oscillatory deformation. These properties give insight into the material's stiffness (elasticity), energy dissipation (viscosity), and transition temperatures (glass transition, secondary transitions), making it possible to assess the overall mechanical response of the material in different conditions.\n\nHere's a simplified description of the DMA process:\n\n1. Sample preparation: A small sample of the composite material is carefully prepared and loaded into the DMA equipment, which is often temperature and force controlled.\n\n2. Frequency sweep: The sample is subjected to a constant stress and a range of oscillatory frequencies, while the storage and loss moduli are measured. This allows for the identification of the material's mechanical response at different frequency domains.\n\n3. Temperature sweep: The sample is subjected to a constant oscillatory frequency, while it is heated or cooled at a controlled rate. The storage and loss moduli are measured as a function of temperature, making it possible to determine the material's transition temperatures and their corresponding relaxation behaviors.\n\n4.

Thucydides' account, \"The History of the Peloponnesian War,\" is considered the founding work of political history and a seminal work for the study of international relations.\n\nThucydides was born into a wealthy and powerful family in Athens. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he fought on the Athenian side during the war. He was likely exiled from Athens at some point, possibly due to his service as a general or his support for the oligarchic faction during the Athenian civil war. He spent many years on the island of Thasos, where he may have continued his work on \"The History of the Peloponnesian War.\" Eventually, he returned to Athens after the oligarchic government was overthrown, and he died there at the age of around 70.\n\n\"The History of the Peloponnesian War\" is a history of the war from its beginning to its end, written by Thucydides in seven books. Thucydides was a master of prose and had a remarkable ability to condense and analyze events in a clear and concise manner. His work is known for its objectivity, accuracy, and lack of moralizing, although it is important to note that he did not attempt to write a comprehensive history of the war, but rather focused on the major events and leaders.\n\nThucydides began his work in 431 BC, and it is believed that he completed it around 404 BC. He divided the war into a series of \"books,\" and each book covers a specific period of time. The first book (1.1-23) provides an introduction to the war and sets the stage for the events that follow. The remaining books (2.1-7.28) cover the war in chronological order and include detailed accounts of the great Athenian and Peloponnesian expeditions, the plague of Athens, and the fall of Athens.\n\nThucydides' work is considered a classical text and is still widely read and studied today. His account of the Peloponnesian War has influenced many later historians and political thinkers, and it has played a crucial role in shaping our understanding of ancient Athens, Sparta, and the ancient world in general.

He began writing his account of the war during the conflict itself, but due to his exile from Athens, he was only able to complete the first part of his work. The remaining books were probably written after his return to Athens many years later, if not by him, then by others who followed his method.\n\nThucydides' account of the war is noteworthy for its emphasis on the rational and self-interested motivations of the opposing parties and its focus on the objective course of events rather than divine intervention.

Additionally, it includes a USB-C port for power and a simple remote control for powering the device, adjusting the volume during playback, and navigating content on the screen.\n\n2. Chromecast with Google TV: Launched in September 2020, Chromecast with Google TV represents a significant departure from past Chromecasts. It comes with a built-in Google TV interface, which allows users to browse, search, and watch content from various streaming apps, such as Netflix, HBO Max, Hulu, and YouTube, all in one place. It also features a dedicated remote control that includes Google Assistant capabilities for voice search and control. The device supports 4K resolution at up to 60FPS and HDR (High Dynamic Range) for enhanced visual quality.\n\n3. Chromecast Audio: First released in September 2015, Chromecast Audio was designed to attach to your audio equipment, enabling any speaker to become a part of your Chromecast-powered wireless audio system. However, in January 2021, Google announced the discontinuation of Chromecast Audio and the availability of its features in newer-generation smart speakers like Google Home and Nest Audio.\n\nIn terms of previous revisions of Chromecast, the following are the key ones:\n\n1. Chromecast (1st Generation): Launched in July 2013, this original model was a tiny dongle that connected to the HDMI port of your TV and streamed content from your mobile device or computer.\n\n2. Chromecast (2nd Generation): Announced in 2015 and featuring an updated design, the 2nd Gen Chromecast had support for 5 GHz Wi-Fi networks and a higher maximum bitrate, resulting in smoother streaming of 1080p content.\n\n3. Chromecast Ultra: Launched in November 2016, this Chromecast model offered 4K resolution, HDR, and Dolby Vision support. It also included an ethernet port for more reliable streaming and a USB port for power. The Chromecast Ultra was discontinued in October 2020.", "shortest_response": "As of my last update, the current Chromecast devices are:\n\n1. Chromecast with Google TV (3rd Gen, 2021): This is the latest Chromecast device, released in September 2021. It comes with a remote, runs on Google TV OS (based on Android TV), supports 4K resolution at 60fps, HDR, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos. It also has a USB-C port for power and carries a price tag of around $49.99.\n\n2. Chromecast (4K) (3rd Gen, 2018): Released in October 2018, this Chromecast supports 4K resolution at 60fps, HDR10, and Dolby Vision. It does not come with a remote, and the user interface is more streamlined compared to the Google TV version. The price is around $39.99.\n\nBefore these, there were two generations of the Chromecast Ultra, which were released in November 2016 and October 2015 respectively. The Chromecast Ultra supported 4K resolution, HDR, and Dolby Vision. However, they have been discontinued and are no longer being sold by Google.\n\nThe first-generation Chromecast was released in July 2013. It supported 1080p resolution and only had an HDMI port for connection. There was also a Chromecast Audio released in September 2014, which was designed for connecting to speakers, except it has been discontinued as well.\n\nEach generation has seen improvements in resolution, support for HDR and Dolby Vision, as well as the addition of hardware features such as a remote control and USB-C port.", "input_size": 36, "output_sizes": [406, 492, 462, 527, 558, 495,

Can you think of any examples?", "longest_response": "Evidence is any kind of data, information, or fact that supports or verifies a hypothesis, claim, or argument. In a broader sense, it can be anything that helps to establish the truth or falsity of a statement. The type of evidence required can vary greatly depending on the context, but I'll provide some examples:\n\n1. Legal context: In a court of law, evidence can include eyewitness accounts, physical items, photographs, videos, written documents, expert testimony, and confessions to establish the guilt or innocence of a defendant. For example, fingerprint evidence, surveillance footage, or a written contract may be used as evidence.\n\n2. Scientific research: In scientific research, evidence can include lab results, observations, controlled experiments, statistical analysis, and peer-reviewed reports to support theories or hypotheses. For example, a study published in a reputable journal showing a correlation between smoking and the risk of lung cancer would be considered as evidence of the health risks associated with smoking.\n\n3. Historical or archaeological context: Evidence in this context can include artifacts, ancient documents, historical accounts, or carbon dating to establish facts about the past. For example, the discovery of the Rosetta Stone provided invaluable evidence for deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.\n\n4. Business context: In business, evidence can include financial records, contracts, customer feedback, sales data, market research, and performance reports to make decisions or validate claims. For example, revenue growth rates, customer satisfaction surveys, or sales projections can be used as evidence to support business decisions or strategic planning.\n\n5. Journalistic context: In journalism, evidence can include eyewitness accounts, interviews, documents, photos, videos, and data to support news stories or investigations. For example, a journalist may use whistleblower documents, interviews with key witnesses, or analysis of data to expose corruption or malpractice.\n\n6. Artistic or academic contexts: In art and academia, evidence can include research papers, scholarly articles, paintings, sculptures, performances, and exhibitions to demonstrate creative ideas, concepts, and theories. For example, a painter may present a collection of their work at a gallery exhibition to prove their mastery of technique or thematic approach.\n\nAll evidence should be reliable, unbiased, and verifiable to ensure its credibility and to avoid misrepresentation of the information. The more varied and extensive the evidence, the stronger the case or argument.", "shortest_response": "Evidence is any kind of data or information that supports a claim or argument. The type of evidence required depends on the context, but generally, it can be categorized into four main types:\n\n1. Direct Evidence: This type of evidence directly proves or disproves a fact or answer. For example, a witness who saw a crime taking place is offering direct evidence when they testify in court.\n\n2. Circumstantial Evidence: While not direct, circumstantial evidence helps establish a chain of inferences leading to the conclusion of a fact. For instance, if a car's tire tracks match the tire tracks at a crime scene, it might help construct a case against the car owner, even if they didn't physically witness the crime.\n\n3. Testimonial Evidence: This refers to statements from witnesses, experts, or parties involved, who provide firsthand or secondhand accounts of events, observations, or opinions. For example, a forensic expert's analysis of a suspected murder weapon would be an example of testimonial evidence.\n\n4. Documentary Evidence: Documents such as contracts, emails, invoices, birth certificates, photographs, and videos serve as evidence when they provide relevant facts about events, transactions, or conditions that occurred or exist. For example, if there were disagreements over the terms of a sales contract, the actual contract document would serve as documentary evidence to clarify the agreement.\n\nEach type of evidence has its strengths and weaknesses, and their credibility often depends on factors like the quality of the evidence, the character and credibility of the witness, and the circumstances under which the evidence was collected.", "input_size": 18, "output_sizes": [363, 528, 475, 367, 493, 500, 481, 358, 369, 352], "output_mean": 428.6, "output_std": 68.21, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 364.0, "p50": 422.0, "p75": 490.0, "p99": 525.48}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 11.63992}, {"sample_id": "504c11681a6c8644", "prompt_id": "0aa5beee17b7af2d", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Implement in Javascript Roles and Permissions (Read, Write or Delete) in Json for Soccer Team app per feature", "longest_response": "To implement roles and permissions for a Soccer Team app in JavaScript, we will define different roles (e.g., Admin, Coach, Player) with specific permissions (Read, Write, Delete) for each feature (e.g., Team, Matches, Standings).

Here are a few strategies that may help you overcome procrastination and stay focused:\n\n1. Break down your projects into smaller, manageable tasks: By doing this, you can focus on completing one task at a time, rather than feeling overwhelmed by the enormity of the entire project.\n2. Set specific goals for each session: Instead of trying to work on a project for an arbitrary amount of time, set a specific goal for what you want to achieve during each work session. This will help you stay focused and make it easier to jump back into your work when you're ready.\n3. Use the Pomodoro Technique: This technique involves working for a set amount of time (e.g., 25 minutes) followed by a short break (e.g., 5 minutes). After completing four work sessions, take a longer break (e.g., 15-30 minutes). This can help you maintain focus and make it easier to get started.\n4. Minimize distractions: Find a quiet, comfortable workspace, turn off notifications, and put away devices that aren't necessary for your work.\n5. Try the 2-minute rule: If a task takes 2 minutes or less to complete, do it immediately instead of procrastinating. This can help you build momentum and make it easier to tackle larger tasks.\n6. Practice mindfulness: Take a few minutes at the start of each work session to focus on your breath, clear your mind, and set your intention for the session. This can help you stay present and focused throughout your work.\n7. Use a rewards system: Give yourself a reward after completing a task or reaching a goal. This can help you stay motivated and make it easier to stay focused.\n\nWhen it comes to starting conversations with me, or any other tasks, it can be helpful to prioritize and focus on one thing at a time. If you have multiple things you want to ask or discuss, make a list or use a task management tool to keep track of them and address them one by one.\n\nIt's also important to be aware of the reasons for your procrastination and try to address the underlying issues. For example, if you're feeling overwhelmed, try to break your projects down into smaller tasks. If you're afraid of making mistakes, try to reframe your mindset and view mistakes as opportunities to learn and grow.\n\nIf you find that you're struggling to stay focused or manage your time effectively, it may be helpful to seek the support of a coach, therapist, or time management expert. They can help you identify the root cause of your procrastination and develop strategies to overcome it.", "shortest_response": "I understand that focusing can be challenging, especially when tackling large projects or when there are multiple tasks vying for your attention. Here are a few strategies that might help you improve focus and reduce procrastination:\n\n1. **Break tasks into smaller parts:** Instead of looking at a large project as a whole, break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. This can make it feel less overwhelming and help you focus on one step at a time.\n\n2. **Use a timer:** The Pomodoro Technique, for example, involves working for 25 minutes, then taking a 5-minute break. Repeat this cycle several times, then take a longer break. This can help you maintain focus during work periods and give your brain a rest when needed.\n\n3. **Eliminate distractions:** Try to create a quiet, clutter-free work environment. Turn off notifications on your devices or use apps that block distractions, especially during focused work periods.\n\n4. **Prioritize tasks:** Make a list of your tasks and prioritize them based on their importance and deadlines. Start with the most critical tasks and break them down into smaller steps.\n\n5. **Set clear goals:** Having a specific, achievable goal for each work session can help you stay focused. Write down what you want to accomplish before you start working.\n\n6. **Mindfulness and meditation:** Practicing mindfulness or meditation can help improve focus and reduce stress, which can in turn reduce procrastination.\n\n7. **Reward yourself:** Give yourself a reward when you complete a task or meet a deadline. This can serve as motivation to start and finish tasks.\n\nRegarding our conversations, it may help to write your questions down as they come up so you can ask them all at once when you have time. Or, ask me to remind you of your question later if you're not ready to focus on it right away.

Do you want to explain them to me?", "longest_response": "Of course! I'd be happy to help explain your technical jokes. Here we go:\n\n1. Why don't programmers like nature?\n   Answer: Because it has too many bugs.\n   Explanation: In programming, a \"bug\" is an error that prevents a program from working correctly. Since nature is unpredictable and chaotic, it contains numerous unexpected occurrences and \"errors,\" making it difficult for programmers to fully understand and replicate.\n\n2. Why was the binary digit not invited to the party?\n   Answer: It was left out in the cold.\n   Explanation: In binary code, \"0\" and \"1\" are used to represent on and off states, or true and false. By extending this to human language, \"0\" represents left or off, while \"1\" represents right or on. Since the left digit (0) is left out in \"cold\" because it faces away from the warm side, it cannot be invited as it has no right side to show up.\n\n3. What do you get if you cross a programmer with a comedian?\n   Answer: Someone who knows how to make people laugh and makes computer jokes.\n   Explanation: The joke plays on the expectations of the listener by initially framing the question as a riddle or hypothetical situation. The answer directly addresses the combination of the two professions, resulting in someone with a unique skillset.\n\n4. How does a programmer show their appreciation for their partner?\n   Answer: They buy them a compiler.\n   Explanation: A \"compiler\" is a program that translates code written in a high-level programming language into a low-level language like machine code. This joke plays on the word \"compiler\" being both a tool used by programmers and a verb related to combining or assembling things. The humor comes from the idea that a programmer might express their love by giving their partner a program that compiles code, rather than a physical object like flowers.\n\n5. What's a computer's least favorite music?\n   Answer: Dis-assem-bly.\n   Explanation: \"Dis-assem-bly\" is slang for disassembling computer code, breaking it down into its original instructions. In music, assembly refers to the process of putting different elements together to make a harmonious whole. The joke plays on this double meaning, as the computer's \"least favorite\" music would presumably be the dis-assembling of music itself.\n\n6. How can you call a hacker on the phone?\n   Answer: You can\u2019t! You know why? Because he's always \"online\"!\n   Explanation: This joke plays on the double meaning of \"online\" as a reference to being connected to the internet and being always available or busy. Since hackers typically spend long hours online and can often be found on the web, they are difficult to reach over the phone.", "shortest_response": "Of course!

It looks like you're working on a simple NeoPixel project with Arduino that moves a blue \"invader\" along the LED strip when a button is pressed. The blue invader starts from the `blueSide` index and moves one position to the right each time the button is pressed.\n\nHere are a few improvements and suggestions for your code:\n\n1. Use the `millis()` function to replace the `delay()` function: The `delay()` function blocks the main loop and can make the program unresponsive to other events. Replace `delay(0.1)` with `millis() - previousMillis >= 100` where `previousMillis` is defined at the top of the `loop()` function. This will make the delay adjustable without requiring a recompile.\n\n2. Use an array to store the invader's position instead of a single variable: This will make it easier to update the color of pixels in front of the invader when it moves.\n\n3. Add errors and checking for out-of-bounds access to the LED strip: Before modifying the invader's position, use `min(numPixels, blueInvader + 1)` to ensure it doesn't go out of bounds. Also, check `blueInvader >= blueSide` to ensure the invader starts on the right side of the LED strip.\n\n4. Use `if...else if` to handle multiple conditions in the button press event: You can check for multiple conditions, such as moving the invader left, moving it back to the start, or resetting it.\n\n5. Add functions to initialize and update the LED strip: This will make your code more modular and easier to extend. For example, you can create a `update_leds()` function that updates the colors of the LEDs based on the invader's position.\n\nHere's the modified code with these improvements and suggestions:\n\n```cpp\n#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>\n\nconst int buttonPin = 2;\nconst int numPixels = 27;\nconst int blueSide = 13; // Index of first blue pixel\n\nAdafruit_NeoPixel pixels = Adafruit_NeoPixel(numPixels, 6, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);\n\nint redSide = 0;\nint blueInvader = blueSide;\nint previousButtonState = HIGH;\nlong previousMillis = 0;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  pixels.begin();\n  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  int buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);\n  long currentMillis = millis();\n\n  if (buttonState == LOW && previousButtonState == HIGH) {\n    previousMillis = currentMillis;\n\n    if (blueInvader < numPixels) {\n      blueInvader++;\n      int position = blueInvader - 1;\n      pixels.setPixelColor(position, pixels.Color(0, 0, 255));\n      pixels.setPixelColor(blueInvader, pixels.Color(255, 0, 0));\n      update_leds();\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (millis() - previousMillis >= 100) {\n    previousButtonState = buttonState;\n  }\n}\n\nvoid update_leds() {\n  for (int i = blueSide; i < blueInvader; i++) {\n    pixels.setPixelColor(i, pixels.Color(0, 0, 0));\n  }\n}\n```", "shortest_response": "Hello! This appears to be an Arduino code for a simple NeoPixel project with a button control. The NeoPixel strip has 27 pixels, and you've defined the index of the first blue pixel (counting from the first pixel) as blueSide.\n\nThe code initializes the NeoPixel strip using the Adafruit library and sets the button pin as an input. In the loop function, it reads the state of the button. When the button is pressed (LOW), it moves the blue invader (the currently illuminated blue pixel) to the right if it's not at the end of the strip. It also updates the color of the previous blue pixel (turning it off) and the new blue pixel (turning it on).\n\nPlease note that the delay of 0.1 seconds between button press events might not be accurate as it could affect the overall timing of the animation. If you're planning to add more features or speed up the animation, consider using `millis()` to create a more precise delay.\n\nAdditionally, it seems that there is a global variable \"redSide\" declared, but it's not used in the current code. If you intend to use it later, make sure you update the code accordingly.\n\nGood luck with your project!

Platforms that offer these services could reduce the need for in-person attendance at funerals.\n\n3. Pre-planning and digital wills: Technology has made it easier for individuals to plan their own funerals and create digital wills, cutting out the need for middlemen like lawyers and funeral directors.\n\n4. Personalization and customization: Digital platforms can offer more personalization and customization options than traditional funeral services, making it easier for families to create unique and meaningful memorials.\n\n5. E-commerce for funeral goods: Online shopping has become increasingly popular, and this trend could extend to funeral goods like urns, memorial jewelry, and flowers.\n\n6. Mental health support and resources: Grieving individuals may seek out mental health support and resources online, which could disrupt the traditional therapy model.\n\n7. Death education and end-of-life planning: There is a growing movement towards educating people about death and end-of-life planning, which could disrupt the traditional funeral industry by empowering individuals to take a more active role in planning their own funerals and taking care of their own affairs.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while these trends represent opportunities for disruption, they also come with challenges. Regulatory hurdles, privacy concerns, and issues around emotions and tradition could slow the pace of change in the bereavement industry. Additionally, some people may still prefer traditional funeral services, and the demand for these services may persist.\n\nUltimately, the bereavement industry is likely to undergo significant change as technology advances and people's attitudes towards death and mourning evolve.

I want to create with similar components with different designs in Figma. How can I increase my productivity.", "longest_response": "To increase your productivity in Figma and create similar components with different designs, follow these steps:\n\n1. Utilize the Auto Layout feature: Figma's Auto Layout allows you to create responsive designs quickly and easily. You can enable Auto Layout on a frame by clicking the square icon with overlapping arrows near the top right corner of the frame. Once enabled, you can adjust the position and size of your elements, and Figma will update the layout accordingly.\n\n2. Use the Component feature: Create components for elements that you repeat often, such as buttons, icons, or headers. This allows you to update a single instance of the component, and the change will propagate everywhere the component is used within the design.\n\n    To create a component, select the element, then click the '+' icon at the top of the layers panel or choose \"Create Component\" from the context menu. You can later edit a component by double-clicking it or selecting it and then clicking the \"Edit component\" button in the properties panel.\n\n3. Use Variants: Variants allow you to create different states for a component, such as press, hover, focus, and disabled. To add a variant, click on the component in the layers panel, then click the white square next to the Component icon. You can then create a new variant and adjust its properties.\n\n4. Use the Copy Style feature: The Copy Style feature allows you to copy the styling of one object and paste it onto another. This can help you quickly create similar elements with only minor differences. Select the source object, then right-click and choose \"Copy Style.\" Next, select the destination object and right-click, then \"Paste Style.\"\n\n5. Organize your layers effectively: Keeping your layers well-organized can help you quickly find and manipulate elements within your design. Use folders to group related elements, and add clear, descriptive names to each layer.\n\n6. Utilize the Design System Manager: If you work on multiple projects, consider creating a design system within Figma. A design system contains reusable components, styles, and documentation, which can greatly increase your productivity. Figma offers a Design System Manager to help with creating and sharing design systems across your team. You can learn more at https://www.figma.com/blog/design-systems/\n\n7. Take advantage of plugins: Figma's library of plugins offers many options to customize and improve your workflow. Some popular ones include Style Dictionary, which helps synchronize design tokens across various platforms, and UI Kits, which provide pre-built component libraries. To browse available plugins, go to Plugins > Browse in Figma.", "shortest_response": "To increase your productivity in Figma when creating similar components with different designs, you can use the following best practices:\n\n1. **Symbols**: Create symbols for components that are repeated across your designs. Symbols allow you to link components so that any changes made to the original symbol are reflected everywhere the symbol is used. This saves a lot of time when making modifications.\n\n2. **Variant States**: If components have multiple states (e.g., hover, clicked, active, etc.), use Figma's variant states feature to manage these different designs within one component. This way, you only have to create one master component, and you can swap out its states as needed.\n\n3. **Auto-Layout**: Use Figma's Auto-Layout feature to help you quickly arrange components that follow a certain layout pattern. By defining containers and spacing within those containers, you can then easily duplicate and adjust the layout for other components.\n\n4. **Plugins**: Utilize Figma plugins to streamline your design process. Some popular plugins for repetitive tasks include Duplicate Master, which duplicates symbols and auto-renames them, and Layer Styles Sync, which helps apply styles consistently across your designs.\n\n5. **Templates**: Create design templates for common UI patterns, such as buttons, cards, and forms. Use these templates as starting points for new designs, as they already include the basic structure and common components. This saves time in setting up the foundation of your design.\n\n6. **Design Systems**: If you work with multiple designers or teams, consider creating and using a design system that includes reusable components, style guides, and documentation. Design systems help maintain consistency across projects and make it easier for designers to quickly find and use pre-built components.\n\n7. **Hotkeys and Shortcuts**: Learn and utilize Figma's keyboard shortcuts for navigating the interface, selecting and editing components, and duplicating and grouping elements. This can help improve your efficiency and speed up your workflow.", "input_size": 33, "output_sizes": [438, 539, 575, 431, 494, 473, 514, 456, 486, 562], "output_mean": 496.8, "output_std": 47.52, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 460.25, "p50": 490.0, "p75": 532.75, "p99": 573.83}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 12.92025}, {"sample_id": "02b2b9278d9f25e1", "prompt_id": "28691cc5e743674f", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "The focus question for the PAT project is: \"What are the necessary steps and financial requirements for successfully starting an e-commerce business to expand a physical retail shop's current product range?\"\n\nThis focus question aims to investigate the steps required to start an e-commerce business for a physical retail shop, including the financial requirements, product offerings, and marketing strategies.

Here's a short story:\n\nIn the bustling heart of New York City, amidst towering skyscrapers and vibrant street life, lived a unique librarian named Arthur. Unlike most city-dwellers, Arthur possessed an extraordinary ability\u2014he could hear the thoughts of books. Whenever he touched the pages of a book, he would become one with the wisdom and stories it contained.\n\nOne chilly winter afternoon, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Arthur picked up an ancient, tattered book from the library\u2019s dusty shelves. The moment his fingers brushed against its cover, he felt a sudden, palpable surge of energy coursing through him. It seemed the book held a secret waiting to be unveiled.\n\nAs he delved deeper into the book\u2019s pages, the tales spun within seemed to weave themselves into Arthur\u2019s very being. He could feel the wind of distant deserts, hear the whispers of long-forgotten civilizations, and taste the salt in the air over a vast ocean. With each passing minute, his connection to the world outside the library grew stronger.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the city, an enigmatic figure known only as The Shadow stalked the streets. The Shadow was seeking a powerful artifact rumored to grant supreme knowledge and control over all the world's secrets. The Shadow had heard whispers of a librarian who could hear the thoughts of books, and believed this man to be the key to finding the artifact.\n\nBack within the library, Arthur finally uncovered an ancient prophecy hidden within the book's pages. The prophecy spoke of a great conflict between light and darkness, and a librarian who would have the power to tip the scales either way. Realizing the burden he'd unwittingly taken upon himself, Arthur knew he had to make a choice\u2014would he help The Shadow claim the artifact, or fight to keep it hidden in the name of peace?\n\nWith every second that ticked by, Arthur felt the forces of darkness draw nearer. He knew he couldn't fight The Shadow alone, so he made his way to the library's grand reading room, seeking allies. The library's patrons were initially confused by Arthur's urgent pleas, but as he shared his discovery, they began to band together\u2014students, scholars, and lovers of literature united against the looming darkness.\n\nTogether, they scoured the library's countless books for clues on how to prevent The Shadow from acquiring the artifact. In doing so, they realized each had their own unique abilities and knowledge, woven together by the love of literature that bound them all. As they came to understand this, they vowed to stand united against any and all who threatened the world's peace.\n\nWith this newfound unity, Arthur and his comrades embarked on a perilous journey to confront The Shadow. They battled through treacherous landscapes and faced trials that pushed the limits of their combined strength. And, as they united against the encroaching darkness, the light within them only grew stronger.\n\nIn the end, the battle with The Shadow unfolded within the hallowed halls of the city's oldest library. Surrounded by the collective wisdom and bravery of his friends, Arthur confronted the powerful figure. Through the power of their shared love for literature, they were able to banish The Shadow and the artifact it sought into the heart of a vast, eternal darkness.\n\nIn the aftermath, the city returned to calm, with its people none the wiser to the events that had unfolded. Though the tales of Arthur's extraordinary ability and the battle against The Shadow would fade into myth, the knowledge that ordinary people are capable of great deeds lived on.\n\nFrom that day forth, Arthur and his companions continued to watch over the world's secrets, guarding and guiding those who sought knowledge. Though never again confronted with an enemy as powerful as The Shadow, they remained united against any who sought to misuse the power of the written word.\n\nAnd so, the story of the librarian who could hear the thoughts of books became just another tale whispered among the pages of time. But those who knew the truth, those who had shared in the wisdom and strength Arthur had passed on, understood that the stories we read and the knowledge we embrace have the power to shape not only the pages of our lives but the world itself.", "shortest_response": "Of course! Here's a short example of a story.\n\nIn the heart of the bustling city of New York, there lived a young woman named Isabella. She was a passionate aspiring musician who could often be found lost in the music that flowed from her violin. Her dream was to perform in the prestigious Carnegie Hall.\n\nOne day, Isabella heard about a competition being held at her local music school. The prize was a performance spot at Carnegie Hall. Excitement bubbled within her as she prepared for the contest. The day arrived, and with a trembling heart, she stepped onto the stage.\n\nAs her fingers danced across the strings, the music seemed to spring to life. The notes swirled around the room, captivating the audience. When she finished her piece, the room fell silent.

If you use this tool correctly, you\u2019ll be well on your way to leading a successful campaign.\n\nWHAT IS A GIFT RANGE CHART?\nA Gift Range Chart provides a framework for the number of gifts, at each gift amount, that you\u2019ll need for a successful campaign.\n\nThe Gift Range Chart is the primary tool for your campaign because it will clarify your campaign goal and help you determine your chances for success at a specific goal amount. But the right Gift Range Chart for your campaign will become the backbone of your campaign in many other ways as well.\n\nA Gift Range Chart will enable you to:\n\nSort your donors by ask amounts\nEstablish the pattern of gifts you\u2019ll need for your campaign\nCreate a strategic order for soliciting gifts\nProvide a logical approach to quantifying the number of prospects you\u2019ll need for your campaign\nHelp your board understand what campaign success is going to take\nShow your top donors where their gifts will fit into the campaign\nTrack and report on your campaign progress\nDevelop a rational plan for donor communication, recognition and naming opportunities\nSAMPLE GIFT RANGE CHART\nYou\u2019ll find several tools to help create your Gift Range Chart in the \u201cPre-Campaign Planning\u201d section of the Capital Campaign Toolkit. Here\u2019s a sample Gift Range Chart to use as a reference:\n\nSample Gift Range Chart for a Capital Campaign\n\nCreating Your Capital Campaign Gift Range Chart\n\nCreating Your Capital Campaign Gift Range Chart\nIn the sample Gift Range Chart in the preceding section, you can see that the top gift is 20% of the campaign goal. And, the first seven gifts take you to $1.4 million \u2014 more than halfway toward the goal.\n\nThe top group of 15 gifts take you to $1.8 million, or 72% \u2014 nearly three-quarters of the way to the campaign goal.\n\nThis pattern, showing a few gifts accounting for a large proportion of the campaign goal, is common for capital campaigns. In most campaigns, the top gift is 20% or 25% of the campaign goal. In some cases, it\u2019s even higher. In fact, only 10 gifts account for at least half the goal in the vast majority of capital campaigns.\n\nOn the other hand, you can see that the remaining gifts \u2014 those of $25,000 or less account for less than 30% of the goal.\n\nOf course, the amounts on this chart are for example only. One standard pattern does not work for every campaign. Your Gift Range Chart will have to reflect the size of your donor base. The smaller your donor base, the larger the gifts in the top of the chart will have to be.\n\n7 TIPS TO CREATE YOUR GIFT RANGE CHART\nHere are seven tips that will help you create a Gift Range Chart for your organization.\n\nBuild your gift chart by starting with the top gift which should be at least 20% of your campaign goal.\nThen work down, increasing the number of gifts as the size of the gifts goes down.\nThe number of gifts in the first column should increase in a rational pattern as the size of the gifts decreases.\nThe gift amounts should be simple and standard to reflect a generic pattern rather than specific gifts you may already have in.\nYou will need 2, 3 or even 4 times the number of prospects than the number of gifts. The prospect multiplier depends on how well you know your donors.\nThe total number of prospects you show in your chart should be no larger than the number of qualified prospects you have in your donor base.\nIf when you get to the bottom of your chart, you find that you need more prospects than you have, go to the top and increase the number of gifts at the top.\nWant one-on-one guidance to help create your campaign\u2019s gift range chart? Just reach out\u2014we\u2019ll be happy to help!\n\nGoing Beyond the Gift Range Chart\n\nGoing Beyond the Gift Range Chart\nThe Gift Range Chart will serve as a roadmap for your campaign. You will use a Depth Chart to add prospect names to each giving level you have decided on in your Gift Range Chart.\n\nFROM GIFT RANGE CHART TO DEPTH CHART\nOnce you\u2019ve created a Gift Range Chart for your campaign, you\u2019ll develop a \u201cDepth Chart\u201d which will attach specific prospective donor names to each gift required for a successful campaign.\n\nSimply take each of the top giving levels and use them as column headers. In each header, indicate how many gifts you will need at that level and how many prospects that will require:\n\nCapital Campaign Depth Chart\n\nNext, start filling out the names of people you can credibly ask for a gift at that level for your campaign. Sorting your donors into columns is done by evaluating their current giving, their potential to give, and their likely inclination.\n\nAs you fill out the Depth Chart, you will clearly see where you have enough qualified prospective donors and where you fall short. If you don\u2019t have any prospect names for the top three levels, you probably need to go back to the drawing board and reduce your campaign goal.\n\nOnce your depth chart has been filled in, you will use it to organize the order of solicitation. You\u2019ll prioritize the top donors to solicit first and then gradually work down to the smaller gifts as laid out on the depth chart.\n\nUSING THE GIFT RANGE CHART TO SOLICIT GIFTS\nOnce you have your depth chart and you start talking to your donors about making gifts to the campaign, you will once again find the gift range chart to be helpful. You should always include a copy of the gift range chart in the materials you take to your donors. When you show it to them, they will be able to see where they might fit in the community of donors. While a donor\u2019s ability to make a gift is important, most donors like to know where their gift fits.\n\nSome donors want to be lead donors. And your chart will show them what that gift would be. Others might not want to be the lead donor but would like to make a significant gift to the campaign. Again, looking at the gift range chart will help them understand the range of giving and where they might place themselves in the community of donors.\n\nTRACKING CAMPAIGN PROGRESS WITH THE GIFT RANGE CHART\nGift range charts have a way of making the essence of a capital campaign clear. So, as gifts come in, you will check them off on your gift range chart. Gradually, as your campaign moves forward, you will see graphically, in a simple way, the progress your campaign is making and what gifts have yet to be committed. Your board members and executive staff will appreciate this very simple tracking devise. It\u2019ll give them a sense of confidence to see the top gifts fill in from the top down.\n\nTools to Create Your Capital Campaign Gift Range Chart\n\nTools to Create Your Capital Campaign Gift Range Chart\nThe sample Gift Range Chart in this post is one of a number of tools available in the Capital Campaign Toolkit\u2019s Pre-Campaign Planning section. Other tools include:\n\nGift Range Chart Calculator\nGift Range Chart Worksheet\nDepth Chart Worksheet\nOther related tools include a plan for your donor recognition guide based on the levels in your Gift Range Chart.\n\nIf you\u2019re eager to utilize these tools for your campaign, check out the different Toolkit options here. Most options include campaign advising, giving you professional support at a fraction the cost of a campaign consultant.\n\nVIDEO: GIFT RANGE CHARTS = YOUR MOST POWERFUL TOOL\nTo learn even more about creating a Gift Range Chart for your campaign, watch the following video (approximately 17 minutes):\nConclusion: Making Sense of Your Campaign\n\nConclusion: Making Sense of Your Campaign\nBecause capital campaigns go on for many months (or even years), you may find it easy to get confused about where you should be putting your efforts during the seven phases of the campaign.\n\nIf, however, you coordinate your campaign plan to a Gift Range Chart, then, when you\u2019re feeling lost, you\u2019ll know where to turn. You\u2019ll look at your chart to review which groups of donors have been solicited, as well as which are next up.\n\nYou may tie your staffing responsibilities to the donor levels of the Gift Range Chart. And you will certainly create a timetable for your campaign that prioritizes the work of the campaign according to giving level, starting with the largest gifts and working down.\n\nAnd even when considering how to thank and recognize donors, once you start thinking about it from the perspective of the giving levels in your Gift Range Chart, all of the planning will fall into place.\n\nA GIFT RANGE CHART MINIMIZES CONFUSION AND BUILDS CONFIDENCE\nWhen you organize your campaign based on a clear top-down strategy as mapped out in the Gift Range Chart, you will minimize confusion and build confidence in the campaign process.\n\nA Gift Range Chart may appear to be a simple planning devise, but when you use it as the essential structure for your campaign, you\u2019ll find that everything falls into place.\n\nHave more questions about capital campaigns or want one-on-one help crafting your strategy?

This process involves adapting to a new method to achieve the same outcome, creating new methods to achieve different outcomes, or stopping a method that is no longer of value.\n\nOrganizational change can significantly impact businesses in numerous ways. Here, I'll discuss some of the potential positive and negative effects:\n\nPositive impacts:\n1. Improved efficiency: Organizational change can lead to more efficient processes, better technologies, and streamlined workflows, resulting in higher productivity and fewer resources being wasted.\n2. Innovation: Change encourages new ideas, allowing companies to develop innovative products, services, and methodologies to stay competitive in their respective markets.\n3. Agility: Implementing changes enables organizations to respond more effectively to market changes, customer preferences, and technological advancements, allowing them to remain relevant and competitive in their industry.\n4. Employee engagement: When employees are part of the change process and are empowered to bring ideas to the table, they can feel more engaged and committed to the organization's mission and goals, leading to better morale and increased retention.\n\nNegative impacts:\n1. Resistance to change: Employees, especially those who have been with the organization for a long time, may be resistant to change and unfamiliar with new processes or technologies. This resistance can lead to decreased productivity, low morale, and conflict within the organization.\n2. Lack of communication: Poor communication about the reasons for change, the process itself, and the expected outcomes can result in employees feeling uninformed, misinformed, and confused. This, in turn, can lead to increased resistance to change.\n3. Disruptions to business operations: Implementing organizational change takes time and resources, which can distract employees from their regular work responsibilities, leading to short-term disruptions in service or production.\n4. Financial risks: Change projects can be costly and run over budget if not managed carefully. If an organization invests heavily in a change initiative and it fails to yield the expected return, this can lead to financial losses.\n\nIn conclusion, organizational change presents both opportunities and challenges for businesses.

However, it's important to note that these solutions have their own characteristics, and their combination requires careful design and implementation to achieve the best results. Let's have a brief look at each.\n\n1. Oracle Advanced Queuing (AQ): AQ is a built-in messaging service in Oracle Database that allows separate application servers to exchange messages using queues and advanced features like message persistence, priority, and serialization control. AQ can help decouple applications by providing an asynchronous communication mechanism, reducing the need for tight synchronization and enabling transactions to be processed in parallel, leading to improved scalability and throughput.\n\n2. Oracle GoldenGate: GoldenGate is a high-performance, real-time data replication package that enables near-continuous data integration between multiple database platforms, along with change data capture (CDC) from non-database sources. GoldenGate is particularly useful for data warehousing and business intelligence systems, ensuring data consistency across different systems. By replicating data between systems in near real-time, GoldenGate improves data availability and reduces the potential for data errors.\n\nWhen decoupling applications, you can use AQ to implement asynchronous messages and GoldenGate for real-time data integration. For example, an application can send messages to an AQ queue, which GoldenGate would pick up and relay to a target database in real-time. Keep in mind that using both AQ and GoldenGate involves adding a level of complexity to the system, so it's essential to ensure proper monitoring, tuning, and error handling to ensure optimal performance and availability.\n\nIn summary, Oracle Advanced Queuing (AQ) and GoldenGate can be successfully used to decouple applications, offering real-time data replication and asynchronous messaging capabilities for improved system scalability, throughput, and data consistency. However, planning, design, and implementation should be carried out carefully, especially when integrating these technologies to achieve your desired outcome efficiently.", "shortest_response": "Yes, Oracle Advanced Queuing (AQ) and GoldenGate can certainly help in decoupling applications, but it's important to note that they serve different purposes and work in conjunction for a more robust decoupling solution.\n\nOracle Advanced Queuing (AQ) is a messaging service that enables message-oriented middleware between applications within an Oracle database. It allows applications to communicate asynchronously, providing a way to decouple them and handle different processing speeds, failures, or concurrent accesses.\n\nGoldenGate, on the other hand, is an Extraction, Transformation, and Load (ETL) tool that replicates data changes from one or more sources (typically databases) to one or more targets (again, usually databases) in real-time or near real-time. It can be used to keep data in different systems consistent and to reduce the impact of high-volume data loads on the source systems.\n\nAs for whether you can \"perfectly\" decouple applications, it's less about a perfect solution and more about finding the right fit for your specific use case. Both AQ and GoldenGate have their strengths and limitations, and their combination can lead to a powerful decoupling strategy. However, you'll still need to consider factors such as system requirements, performance needs, data integrity, and the complexity of your applications and data flows.", "input_size": 24, "output_sizes": [329, 298, 297, 406, 465, 352, 377, 446, 341, 386], "output_mean": 369.7, "output_std": 54.55, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 332.0, "p50": 364.5, "p75": 401.0, "p99": 463.29}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 10.09893}, {"sample_id": "2c4eea3ffae42608", "prompt_id": "5aace79547c0aa2e", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "what quote from Shakespeare could shed valuable light on the state of AI technology today?", "longest_response": "While no single quote from Shakespeare directly addresses AI technology, his work often explored themes of human nature, autonomy, and the consequences of power.

It does not have consciousness, emotions, or a sense of self as humans do.\n\nAs AI technology continues to advance and adapt, this quote highlights the transformative nature of this technology and serves as a reminder that just as human actors bring life to their characters, AI brings structure, speed, and precision to the tasks it is designed to perform.", "input_size": 19, "output_sizes": [235, 257, 272, 307, 279, 222, 314, 226, 351, 363], "output_mean": 282.6, "output_std": 47.59, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 240.5, "p50": 275.5, "p75": 312.25, "p99": 361.92}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 7.72398}, {"sample_id": "4aea57b1e745dde0", "prompt_id": "4ae421f9900aa282", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Write an academic essay that directly addresses the prompt, with a clear central idea, supported with evidence, reasoning and scholarship.

While it is undeniable that there have been significant strides in certain aspects of life, this essay contends that the quality of life metric is multidimensional, and a unidirectional, progressive narrative oversimplifies the complexities inherent in human development.\n\nThe 21st century has undoubtedly witnessed transformative advancements in various domains of human existence. Technological innovations have revolutionized communication and transportation, drastically reducing the time and effort required to connect with people across the globe. This has opened up avenues for educational, professional, and cultural growth, enriching the lives of many. For instance, the proliferation of the internet has democratized access to information, enabling individuals to learn, work, and socialize from the confines of their homes, thereby enhancing convenience and flexibility (UNESCO, 2020).\n\nHowever, this narrative of unadulterated progress conceals an intricate web of challenges and contradictions that have also defined the 21st century. One of the most profound is the deepening inequality that characterizes the global landscape. According to the World Inequality Report (2018), the wealth of the top 1% has more than doubled since 1980, while the bottom 50% has experienced a relative decline in income. This inequality, coupled with the concentration of resources and opportunities in urban areas, has exacerbated disparities in quality of life between regions (Walton, 2016).\n\nFurthermore, the 21st century has also witnessed a significant rise in mental health issues, with numerous studies attributing this trend to factors such as stress, social isolation, and the relentless pursuit of productivity (American Psychological Association, 2020). In this context, it can be argued that while technology has made certain aspects of life more convenient, it has also created a cultural milieu that prioritizes efficiency and productivity over emotional well-being, leading to a deterioration in quality of life for many.\n\nAs we engage with the debate on quality of life, it is imperative to acknowledge that the perception of progress is subjective, contingent on factors such as cultural values, national contexts, and personal definitions of happiness. For some, the convenience and opportunities afforded by modernity may indeed equate to a superior quality of life. For others, the loss of community, the erosion of traditional values, and the relentless pace of change may manifest as a detraction from the quality of life.\n\nIn conclusion, while the 21st century has undeniably ushered in transformative changes that have impacted various aspects of human life, it is misleading to assert that it has universally improved the quality of life. The quality of life is a complex, multidimensional construct that encompasses factors such as physical health, emotional well-being, social connections, and environmental sustainability. An unbalanced focus on quantitative, material indicators of progress perpetuates a simplistic, unidirectional narrative that obscures the myriad challenges and contradictions that are intrinsic to human development. A more nuanced understanding of quality of life necessitates a holistic, multidimensional perspective that accounts for the diverse experiences, perceptions, and values of individuals across the globe.\n\nReferences:\n- American Psychological Association.

While it is undeniable that advances in technology, healthcare, and social structures have undoubtedly elevated certain aspects of contemporary life, the argument for an unquestionable superiority of the 21st century's quality of life must be scrutinized closely to account for the complexities and nuances inherent in this debate.\n\nThe 21st century has witnessed unprecedented technological advancements. The proliferation of the internet, for example, has broken down geographical barriers, enabling global communication and access to information. This has democratized education, facilitated economic opportunity, and fostered cross-cultural understanding at a scale hitherto unimaginable. However, the pervasiveness of digital technology also engenders concerns regarding privacy, mental health, and societal cohesion, which warrants a balanced appraisal of its impact on the quality of life.\n\nIn the realm of healthcare, the 21st century has made quantum leaps. Vaccination programs, antibiotics, and advances in surgical procedures have drastically reduced mortality rates and improved life expectancy. Yet, this progress coexists with escalating healthcare costs, accessibility issues, and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, casting doubts on the unadulterated improvement in healthcare-related quality of life.\n\nMoreover, while the 21st century has seen notable progress in social equality and human rights, inequality persists both within and between nations. The wealth gap continues to widen, and despite the strides made in gender, racial, and ethnic equity, discrimination and marginalization remain omnipresent. The extent to which these social disparities detract from the quality of life of those who are disadvantaged is a matter of considerable debate.\n\nIn contrast, previous eras were characterized by harder physical labor, less technological aid, and more limited access to medical care and education. Yet, scholars and historians often emphasize the virtues of simpler, more communal lifestyles that prevailed in those times, which some argue contributed positively to the quality of life by promoting social cohesion, self-reliance, and a deeper connection to nature.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that the 21st century has brought about numerous improvements to the human condition, the debate over whether it offers a definitively superior quality of life compared to preceding periods is far from settled. A comprehensive understanding of this issue necessitates an acknowledgement and careful examination of both the tangible benefits and the intangible costs associated with the advancements of the modern era. It is essential to appreciate the complexities and trade-offs associated with these advancements and to strive for a holistic approach in our pursuit of a better quality of life.", "input_size": 109, "output_sizes": [769, 956, 690, 752, 897, 897, 664, 793, 994, 850], "output_mean": 826.2, "output_std": 105.04, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 756.25, "p50": 821.5, "p75": 897.0, "p99": 990.58}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 25.73072}, {"sample_id": "c3c544d4f50b64ef", "prompt_id": "94dde03e35e19ed6", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Przyk\u0142adowy modu\u0142 magento.", "longest_response": "W tym przyk\u0142adzie przygotujmy prosty modu\u0142 Magento 2, kt\u00f3ry umo\u017cliwi dodawanie w\u0142asnych zmiennych do klasy `\\Magento\\Framework\\DataObject`, a nast\u0119pnie u\u017cywanie tych zmiennych w pliku tworz\u0105cym HTML.\n\n1.

But when she went to Price to ask for permission to rejoin her team, she was met with resistance.\n\n\"Red, I'm not sure if this is a good idea,\" Price said, his voice laced with concern. \"Your body may be ready, but your mind is a different story. You were tortured for months, and your memory is spotty at best. And those nightmares...we can't have you out there in that state.\"\n\nRed felt a twinge of frustration.

Suddenly, she heard a familiar voice behind her.\n\n\"Red?\" Ghost called out, his voice filled with concern.\n\nRed turned to see Ghost approaching her, a worried look on his face. She had avoided him ever since she had returned to the base, not wanting to burden him with her problems. But now, she felt a strange sense of relief at seeing him.\n\n\"Ghost,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nGhost came to stand beside her, his arm wrapping around her shoulders in a gesture of comfort. \"Hey, Red. What's going on?\" he asked.\n\nRed took a deep breath, feeling a tear slip down her cheek. \"I saw the psychiatrist today,\" she said. \"He said I'm not ready to go back into combat yet.\"\n\nGhost squeezed her shoulders gently. \"I'm sorry to hear that, Red,\" he said. \"But it's for the best, isn't it?

You'll get through this, I know you will.\"\n\nRed felt a sudden sense of comfort and hope. If anyone could understand what she was going through, it was Ghost. He had been through his own hell, and he had come out the other side stronger. Maybe she could, too.\n\n\"Thanks, Ghost,\" she said, her voice filled with gratitude. \"I don't know what I'd do without you.\"\n\nGhost smiled, his eyes soft. \"We're in this together, Red. No matter what, we're a team.\"\n\nRed felt a surge of affection for Ghost, a friendship that had been forged in the fires of war. She knew that she could count on him, just as he could count on her. And, for the first time in what felt like an eternity, she felt a glimmer of hope.\n\nShe turned to Ghost, a small smile on her face. \"You know what, Ghost? I think I'm going to be okay.\"\n\nGhost's smile widened, his eyes shining with pride. \"I knew it all along, Red. You're stronger than you think.\"\n\nRed felt a newfound sense of determination.

Traditional methods often involve expensive equipment, time-consuming processes, and reliance on skilled artists. However, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming this landscape, making it possible for production houses to create one-of-a-kind visual styles at a fraction of the cost.\n\nOne such AI platform leading this revolution is Stable Diffusion. This cutting-edge technology uses a unique combination of machine learning and diffusion models to generate high-quality, customizable images. Stable Diffusion's AI can mimic the style of various artists, from classic painters to modern digital artists, allowing video producers to create truly unique and visually stunning special effects.\n\nLet's delve into how Stable Diffusion works and how it can be integrated with Adobe After Effects, a popular digital visual effects, motion graphics, and compositing application, to elevate video production.\n\nStable Diffusion works by using a series of algorithms to generate images based on specific inputs. It learns from a vast dataset of images, understanding the relationships between pixels and how to create new, realistic images. This learning process enables Stable Diffusion to create a wide range of styles, from photorealistic to highly stylized, and everything in between.\n\nOnce an image is generated by Stable Diffusion, it can be seamlessly integrated into Adobe After Effects for further manipulation and compositing. This process allows video producers to combine these AI-generated images with other elements, such as live-action footage, to create compelling and visually coherent special effects.\n\nFor instance, a producer might want to create a surreal, dream-like sequence for a dramatic moment in a film. By using Stable Diffusion to generate images in a specific, dreamy style, and then bringing those images into After Effects, the producer can animate and composite those images with live-action footage to create a captivating scene that feels completely original.\n\nMoreover, the cost savings associated with using AI image generators like Stable Diffusion are substantial. Rather than hiring a team of artists to hand-draw or digitally paint unique special effects, producers can use AI to generate those effects quickly and cost-effectively. This not only speed up the production process but also frees up resources for other aspects of the production.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of AI image generators like Stable Diffusion into video production workflows offers unprecedented opportunities for creating low-cost, high-quality, and truly unique special effects. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovations in the realm of special effects, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in video production.\n\nSo, whether you're an independent filmmaker, a large-scale production company, or a creative professional looking to add a new dimension to your work, the time to explore the possibilities of AI in video production is now. Embrace the future, and let AI help you bring your vision to life.", "shortest_response": "Title: Revolutionizing Video Production: Leveraging AI Image Generators for Unique and Cost-Effective Special Effects\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of video production, one of the most exciting developments is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) image generators.

On December 5, a team at LLNL\u2019s National Ignition Facility (NIF) conducted the first controlled fusion experiment in history to reach this milestone, also known as scientific energy breakeven, meaning it produced more energy from fusion than the laser energy used to drive it. This historic, first-of-its kind achievement will provide unprecedented capability to support NNSA\u2019s Stockpile Stewardship Program and will provide invaluable insights into the prospects of clean fusion energy, which would be a game-changer for efforts to achieve President Biden\u2019s goal of a net-zero carbon economy.\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark achievement for the researchers and staff at the National Ignition Facility who have dedicated their careers to seeing fusion ignition become a reality, and this milestone will undoubtedly spark even more discovery,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. \u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration is committed to supporting our world-class scientists\u2014like the team at NIF\u2014whose work will help us solve humanity\u2019s most complex and pressing problems, like providing clean power to combat climate change and maintaining a nuclear deterrent without nuclear testing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have had a theoretical understanding of fusion for over a century, but the journey from knowing to doing can be long and arduous. Today\u2019s milestone shows what we can do with perseverance,\u201d said Dr. Arati Prabhakar, the President\u2019s Chief Advisor for Science and Technology and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\n\u201cMonday, December 5, 2022, was a historic day in science thanks to the incredible people at Livermore Lab and the National Ignition Facility. In making this breakthrough, they have opened a new chapter in NNSA\u2019s Stockpile Stewardship Program,\u201d said NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby. \u201cI would like to thank the members of Congress who have supported the National Ignition Facility because their belief in the promise of visionary science has been critical for our mission. Our team from around the DOE national laboratories and our international partners have shown us the power of collaboration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pursuit of fusion ignition in the laboratory is one of the most significant scientific challenges ever tackled by humanity, and achieving it is a triumph of science, engineering, and most of all, people,\u201d LLNL Director Dr. Kim Budil said. \u201cCrossing this threshold is the vision that has driven 60 years of dedicated pursuit\u2014a continual process of learning, building, expanding knowledge and capability, and then finding ways to overcome the new challenges that emerged. These are the problems that the U.S. national laboratories were created to solve.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis astonishing scientific advance puts us on the precipice of a future no longer reliant on fossil fuels but instead powered by new clean fusion energy,\u201d U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer said. I commend Lawrence Livermore National Labs and its partners in our nation\u2019s Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) program, including the University of Rochester\u2019s Lab for Laser Energetics in New York, for achieving this breakthrough.\u00a0Making this future clean energy world a reality will require our physicists, innovative workers, and brightest minds at our DOE-funded institutions, including the Rochester Laser Lab, to double down on their cutting-edge work.\u00a0That\u2019s why I\u2019m also proud to announce today that I\u2019ve helped to secure the highest ever authorization of over $624 million this year in the National Defense Authorization Act for the ICF program to build on this amazing breakthrough.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter more than a decade of scientific and technical innovation, I congratulate the team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the National Ignition Facility for their historic accomplishment,\u201d said U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (CA). \u201cThis is an exciting step in fusion and everyone at Lawrence Livermore and NIF should be proud of this milestone achievement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an historic, innovative achievement that builds on the contributions of generations of Livermore scientists. Today, our nation stands on their collective shoulders. We still have a long way to go, but this is a critical step and I commend the U.S. Department of Energy and all who contributed toward this promising breakthrough, which could help fuel a brighter clean energy future for the United States and humanity,\u201d said U.S. Senator Jack Reed (RI), the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\n\u201cThis monumental scientific breakthrough is a milestone for the future of clean energy,\u201d said U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (CA). \u201cWhile there is more work ahead to harness the potential of fusion energy, I am proud that California scientists continue to lead the way in developing clean energy technologies. I congratulate the scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for their dedication to a clean energy future, and I am committed to ensuring they have all of the tools and funding they need to continue this important work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a very big deal. We can celebrate another performance record by the National Ignition Facility. This latest achievement is particularly remarkable because NIF used a less spherically symmetrical target than in the August 2021 experiment,\u201d said U.S. Representative Zoe Lofgren (CA-19). \u201cThis significant advancement showcases the future possibilities for the commercialization of fusion energy. Congress and the Administration need to fully fund and properly implement the fusion research provisions in the recent CHIPS and Science Act and likely more. During World War II, we crafted the Manhattan Project for a timely result. The challenges facing the world today are even greater than at that time. We must double down and accelerate the research to explore new pathways for the clean, limitless energy that fusion promises.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am thrilled that NIF\u2014the United States\u2019 most cutting-edge nuclear research facility\u2014has achieved fusion ignition, potentially providing for a new clean and sustainable energy source in the future. This breakthrough will ensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile, open new frontiers in science, and enable progress toward new ways to power our homes and offices in future decades,\u201d said U.S. Representative Eric Swalwell (CA-15). \u201cI commend the scientists and researchers for their hard work and dedication that led to this monumental scientific achievement, and I will continue to push for robust funding for NIF to support advancements in fusion research.\u201d\n\nLLNL\u2019s experiment surpassed the fusion threshold by delivering\u00a02.05\u00a0megajoules (MJ) of energy to the target, resulting in\u00a03.15 MJ of fusion energy output, demonstrating for the first time a most fundamental science basis for inertial fusion energy (IFE).\u00a0Many advanced science and technology developments are still needed to achieve simple, affordable IFE to power homes and businesses, and DOE is currently restarting a broad-based, coordinated IFE program in the United States. Combined with private-sector investment, there is a lot of momentum to drive rapid progress toward fusion commercialization.\n\nFusion is the process by which two light nuclei combine to form a single heavier nucleus, releasing a large amount of energy. In the 1960s, a group of pioneering scientists at LLNL hypothesized that lasers could be used to induce fusion in a laboratory setting. Led by physicist John Nuckolls, who later served as LLNL director from 1988 to 1994, this revolutionary idea became inertial confinement fusion, kicking off more than 60 years of research and development in lasers, optics, diagnostics, target fabrication, computer modeling and simulation, and experimental design.\n\nTo pursue this concept, LLNL built a series of increasingly powerful laser systems, leading to the creation of NIF, the world\u2019s largest and most energetic laser system. NIF\u2014located at LLNL in Livermore, Calif.\u2014is the size of a sports stadium and uses powerful laser beams to create temperatures and pressures like those in the cores of stars and giant planets, and inside exploding nuclear weapons.\n\nAchieving ignition was made possible by dedication from LLNL employees as well as countless collaborators at DOE\u2019s Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, and Nevada National Security Site; General Atomics; academic institutions, including the University of Rochester\u2019s Laboratory for Laser Energetics, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of California, Berkeley, and Princeton University; international partners, including the United Kingdom\u2019s Atomic Weapons Establishment and the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission; and stakeholders at DOE and NNSA and in Congress.", "longest_response": "The article reports on a groundbreaking scientific achievement by researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in California.

Each event (impression, install, etc.) from each user should be tagged with a unique identity for the user.\n\n2. **Data Storage**: Store the events in a scalable and flexible database. A distributed database like Apache Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB, or Google Bigtable is suitable due to their ability to handle large volumes of data and provide fast read and write operations.\n\n3. **Event Processing**: Use event streaming platforms like Apache Flink, Apache Spark Streaming, or AWS Kinesis Data Analytics to process events in real-time. This will allow you to perform tasks like counting the number of events for each user, which can then be used to calculate aggregate data for each user's last 180 days.\n\n4. **Aggregation**: Implement a mechanism to aggregate user data for the last 180 days. This can be done by retaining aggregated data for each user for a specific time period (e.g., 7 days of aggregates for the last 26 periods) in a time-series database like InfluxDB or TimescaleDB. This approach will allow you to calculate the aggregates for any time period (e.g., the last 180 days) by summing up the corresponding data points in the retention period.\n\n5. **Data Retrieval**: Implement an API or query layer on top of your storage system to allow users and other systems to retrieve a user's aggregated data. This API should support querying data for specific intervals (e.g., the last 180 days) and return results in a usable format (e.g., JSON or XML).\n\n6. **Scalability and Reliability**: Ensure that your system is designed to handle increasing loads gracefully by distributing data and processing across multiple nodes (horizontal scalability). Implement measures like load balancing, auto-healing, and monitoring to improve reliability and resilience.\n\n7. **Security and Privacy**: Implement appropriate security measures to protect the data, such as encryption at rest and in transit, secure network configurations, and access controls based on user roles and permissions. To maintain user privacy, consider using data anonymization techniques or pseudonymization.", "input_size": 51, "output_sizes": [561, 588, 634, 953, 709, 792, 648, 593, 599, 683], "output_mean": 676.0, "output_std": 112.99, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 594.5, "p50": 641.0, "p75": 702.5, "p99": 938.51}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 23.79315}, {"sample_id": "fe3e407f7d4c5743", "prompt_id": "0b7038fa3a721ed1", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "How do structs work in Rust?", "longest_response": "In Rust, a `struct` (short for structure) is a composite data type that allows you to package multiple variables of different data types into a single unit. This can help manage related data and improve code organization. Here's a basic overview of how to work with structs in Rust:\n\n1. Defining a struct:\n\n```rust\nstruct User {\n    username: String,\n    email: String,\n    sign_in_count: u64,\n    active: bool,\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we've created a `User` struct with four fields: `username`, `email`, `sign_in_count`, and `active`. Each field has a specific data type.\n\n2. Creating instances:\n\nTo create an instance (also known as an object or a value) of a struct, use the following syntax:\n\n```rust\nlet user1 = User {\n    email: String::from(\"someone@example.com\"),\n    username: String::from(\"someusername123\"),\n    active: true,\n    sign_in_count: 1,\n};\n```\n\n3. Accessing fields:\n\nYou can access struct fields using the dot operator (`.`):\n\n```rust\nlet user1 = User {\n    email: String::from(\"someone@example.com\"),\n    username: String::from(\"someusername123\"),\n    active: true,\n    sign_in_count: 1,\n};\n\nlet email = user1.email;\nlet username = user1.username;\n```\n\n4. Field initializers (optional):\n\nIf a struct's fields have default values, you can omit initializing some of them when creating an instance.\n\n```rust\nstruct User {\n    active: bool,\n    username: String,\n    email: String,\n    sign_in_count: u64,\n}\n\nlet user1 = User {\n    email: String::from(\"someone@example.com\"),\n    ..User {\n        active: true,\n        username: String::from(\"someusername123\"),\n        email: String::from(\"another_email@example.com\"),\n        sign_in_count: 0,\n    }\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, we're creating `user1` using the partial initialization of another `User` instance that has the active, username, email, and sign\\_in\\_count fields filled in. The `..` syntax tells Rust to copy all the fields from the source struct (except for the `email` field, which we've explicitly set).\n\n5. Named and Position-Based Fields:\n\nRust allows you to define both named and position-based fields in a struct. Position-based fields are accessed using an index starting from zero.\n\n```rust\nstruct Color(u8, u8, u8);\nlet rgb = Color(255, 0, 0); // The red color (255, 0, 0)\nlet red = rgb.0; // Access the first field\n```\n\n6. Destructuring structs:\n\nYou can extract struct fields using destructuring:\n\n```rust\nlet User { email, username, active, sign_in_count } = user1;\nprintln!(\"{} has signed in {} times\", username, sign_in_count);\n```\n\n7. Deconstructing with `unwrap()` and `error()`:\n\nIf your struct contains a `Result`, you can use the `unwrap()` and `error()` methods to deconstruct it:\n\n```rust\nuse std::result;\n\nfn gets_username() -> Result<String, &'static str> {\n    Ok(\"someusername456\".to_string())\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let result = gets_username();\n    let username = match result {\n        Ok(username) => username,\n        Err(error) => return println!(\"Error: {}\", error),\n    };\n    println!(\"Username: {}\", username);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `gets_username()` function returns a `Result`. We use a `match` statement to deconstruct the result, retrieve the username and print it out. If the result is an error, we return an error message to the caller.\n\n8. Tuples vs Structs:\n\nTuples serve a similar purpose to structs in that they are a way to aggregate multiple values, but structs offer more flexibility and better organization of the data they contain. Structs provide named fields, methods, and the ability to specify default values.", "shortest_response": "In Rust, a struct (short for structure) is a custom data type that encapsulates multiple related values. It allows you to bundle together various pieces of data, and give names to those data fields.\n\nHere's a simple example of a struct definition:\n\n```rust\nstruct User {\n    username: String,\n    email: String,\n    sign_up_date: Date,\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we've defined a `User` struct with three fields: `username`, `email`, and `sign_up_date`. The types of these fields are indicated after the `:` symbol.\n\nYou can create a new instance of this struct like this:\n\n```rust\nlet user1 = User {\n    email: String::from(\"johndoe@example.com\"),\n    username: String::from(\"johndoe\"),\n    sign_up_date: Date::yesterday(),\n};\n```\n\nYou can also abbreviate the field names when creating a new instance by using positional syntax:\n\n```rust\nlet user2 = User {\n    (\"johndoe\", \"johndoe@example.com\", Date::yesterday()),\n};\n```\n\nTo access the fields of a struct, you use the dot notation:\n\n```rust\nprintln!(\"{} registered with email: {}\", user1.username, user1.email);\n```\n\nYou can also add methods to structs, which act like functions but have access to the struct's fields. This is useful for implementing common operations for your data type:\n\n```rust\nimpl User {\n    fn new(username: String, email: String) -> User {\n        User {\n            email,\n            username,\n            sign_up_date: Date::today(),\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow you can create a new `User` instance more concisely:\n\n```rust\nlet user3 = User::new(String::from(\"janedoe\"), String::from(\"janedoe@example.com\"));\n```", "input_size": 12, "output_sizes": [699, 626, 1055, 615, 652, 647, 592, 585, 472, 674], "output_mean": 661.7, "output_std": 143.78, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 597.75, "p50": 636.5, "p75": 668.5, "p99": 1022.96}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 26.62401}, {"sample_id": "26431ad416c09edc", "prompt_id": "869ef6fe22265f89", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\nimport nltk\nnltk.download('omw-1.4')\nnltk.download('wordnet')\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word\\_tokenize\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\nfrom sklearn.feature\\_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.model\\_selection import KFold\nfrom sklearn.utils.class\\_weight import compute\\_class\\_weight\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1\\_score\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n\n# Set seed value\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n# Load data\ntrain\\_df = pd.read\\_csv('train.csv')\ntest\\_df = pd.read\\_csv('test.csv')\n\n# Compute class weights\nclass\\_weights = compute\\_class\\_weight(class\\_weight='balanced', classes=np.unique(train\\_df['label']), y=train\\_df['label'])\n\n# Define text pre-processing functions\ndef preprocess\\_text(text):\n # Remove non-alphabetic characters\n text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\\s]', '', text)\n # Convert to lowercase\n text = text.lower()\n # Tokenize\n tokens = word\\_tokenize(text)\n # Remove stopwords\n tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stopwords.words('english')]\n # Lemmatize\n lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens]\n # Join tokens back into a string\n text = ' '.join(tokens)\n return text\n\n# Preprocess train and test text data with progress bar\ntrain\\_df['text'] = tqdm(train\\_df['text'].apply(preprocess\\_text))\ntest\\_df['text'] = tqdm(test\\_df['text'].apply(preprocess\\_text))\n\n# Define KFold cross-validation with progress bar\nkf = tqdm(KFold(n\\_splits=5, shuffle=True, random\\_state=42))\n\n# Define TF-IDF vectorizer\ntfidf = TfidfVectorizer()\n\n# Initialize F1 scores\nf1\\_scores = []\n\n# Train and evaluate model for each fold with progress bar\nfor fold, (train\\_index, val\\_index) in enumerate(kf.split(train\\_df)):\n\n # Get train and validation data\n X\\_train, y\\_train = train\\_df.iloc[train\\_index]['text'], train\\_df.iloc[train\\_index]['label']\n X\\_val, y\\_val = train\\_df.iloc[val\\_index]['text'], train\\_df.iloc[val\\_index]['label']\n\n # Compute TF-IDF features\n X\\_train\\_tfidf = tfidf.fit\\_transform(X\\_train)\n X\\_val\\_tfidf = tfidf.transform(X\\_val)\n\n # Train SVM model with class weights\n svm = SVC(class\\_weight={i: w for i, w in enumerate(class\\_weights)}, kernel='linear', random\\_state=42)\n svm.fit(X\\_train\\_tfidf, y\\_train)\n\n # Evaluate on validation set\n y\\_val\\_pred = svm.predict(X\\_val\\_tfidf)\n f1 = f1\\_score(y\\_val, y\\_val\\_pred, average='weighted')\n f1\\_scores.append(f1)\n\n # Save predictions on test set for this fold\n X\\_test\\_tfidf = tfidf.transform(test\\_df['text'])\n y\\_test\\_pred = svm.predict(X\\_test\\_tfidf)\n test\\_df[f'fold{fold+1}'] = y\\_test\\_pred\n\n # Update progress bar and print F1 score\n kf.set\\_description(f'Fold {fold+1} F1 score: {f1:.4f}')\n kf.update()\n\n# Compute average F1 score\nprint(f'Average F1 score: {np.mean(f1\\_scores):.4f}')\n\n# Ensemble predictions\n#Ensemble predictions from all folds\ntest\\_df['label'] = test\\_df[[f'fold{fold+1}' for fold in range(5)]].mode(axis=1)[0]\n\n#Save predictions to file\ntest\\_df[['id', 'label']].to\\_csv('./0316\\_test.csv', index=False)\n\nprint(\"Ensemble predictions completed.\")\n\n#Done!\n\nat this code Just let me see the progress bar on this whole code.", "longest_response": "To add a progress bar to the whole code, you can use the `tqdm.notebook` or `tqdm.gui` for Jupyter notebooks, or use the `tqdm.auto` for both console and Jupyter.

This phase involves assessing the efficacy of the corrective actions taken, tracking progress, and identifying any obstacles that may hinder successful implementation.\n\n2. Progress Reporting: Frequent, clear, and concise progress reports should be made available to all relevant stakeholders, including the service provider and regulatory bodies. These reports should outline accomplishments, remaining action items, and a timeline for completion.\n\n3. Interim Corrective Measures: If a situation arises where continued service poses a significant risk to users or the organization, interim corrective measures can be put in place while the CAP is being implemented. These measures may include supplementary checks, temporary service limitations, or additional staff training to address the issue.\n\n4. Escalation Process: Establish an escalation process that outlines the steps to be taken when a CAP shows limited or no progress. This process can include notifications to higher-level management, engaging external consultants, or introducing stricter measures within the service agreement.\n\n5. Remedial Training: If repeated errors or non-compliance indicate a lack of understanding or expertise, remedial training can be provided to the service provider's team members. This training can focus on specific areas that need improvement and aim to fill knowledge gaps.\n\n6. Service Improvement Plan (SIP): If the provider demonstrates a sincere effort to address issues and implement meaningful corrective actions, consider creating a Service Improvement Plan (SIP). An SIP can outline a series of actionable steps that, once completed, will improve the overall quality and efficiency of the service.

These devices can include computers, servers, printers, mainframes, switches, routers, and mobile devices.\n\nThe fundamental concept of a computer network allows multiple computers to communicate with each other, share files, access shared peripherals (such as printers), exchange email, and collaborate on documents in real time. Various types of networks can be classified based on their geographical scope, the number of computers they connect, and the technology used to transmit data. These types of networks include:\n\n1. LAN (Local Area Network): A LAN is a network that connects computers and other devices in a relatively small area. Examples of LANs include homes, schools, and office buildings.\n\n2. WAN (Wide Area Network): A WAN is a network that covers a large geographical area, such as cities, regions, countries, or even spanning continents. The Internet is the most common example of a WAN.\n\n3. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): A MAN is a network that lies somewhere between a LAN and a WAN. It covers a city or a town and can connect multiple LANs together.\n\n4. SAN (Storage Area Network): A SAN is a network that consists of storage devices and other network infrastructure, providing block-level access to data storage.\n\n5. PAN (Personal Area Network): A PAN is a network with a small geographical scope, providing connections between personal devices such as smartphones, headsets, laptops, tablets, digital cameras, and smartwatches.\n\n6. Mesh Network: A mesh network is a self-healing system, where every device is connected to multiple other devices. If one link fails, the network finds an alternative path. Mesh networks often are used in applications where an infrastructure network may not be available.\n\nNetworks can also be classified according to their architecture: peer-to-peer or client-server. In peer-to-peer networks, all devices have the same capabilities, and they share resources directly with each other. In client-server networks, some devices act as servers and provide services, while the other devices, called clients, request services from the servers.\n\nTo establish a communication between devices in a network, certain networking protocols are employed that define how data is transmitted, addressed, routed, and received. Some common networking protocols include:\n\n1. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)\n2. IPv4 and IPv6 (Internet Protocol versions)\n3. HTTP and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure)\n4. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)\n5. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)\n6. DNS (Domain Name System)\n7. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)\n\nIn summary, computer networks enable interconnectivity between multiple devices, allowing them to exchange data, share resources, and collaborate in real-time.

Here are some key trends and developments:\n\n1. Recognition of AI-generated works: Many countries are beginning to recognize the existence of AI-generated works and are attempting to address the associated legal and ethical challenges in their IP frameworks. However, the current legal landscape is still largely based on human creativity, and there is widespread debate over whether AI systems can truly \"own\" or be attributed as creators of intellectual property.\n\n2. Copyright protection for AI-generated works: In general, copyright protection applies to original works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible form of expression. The key question is whether AI systems can create original works by exercising human-like creativity and, therefore, be considered authors under copyright law. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom and the European Union, have not yet made a definitive decision on this issue. However, other jurisdictions, such as the United States and India, have taken a more liberal approach. For example, the US Copyright Office granted a copyright certificate to an AI-generated artwork in 2019.\n\n3. Data as a key factor: AI systems rely on vast amounts of data to generate content, raising questions about the role of data owners and users in the creation process. Some argue that without the initial data, AI systems would not be able to produce any content, which could challenge the traditional notion of originality and authorship. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the use and misuse of data, particularly sensitive or personal data, in the context of AI-generated works.\n\n4. Moral rights: In addition to economic rights, copyright laws often provide authors with moral rights, such as the right to claim authorship and the right to object to distortion, mutilation, or other modifications of their work. The application of moral rights to AI-generated works can be complex, as it is unclear whether AI systems can be attributed a sense of authorship or have personal feelings that can be harmed by alterations to their creations.\n\n5. Balancing innovation and control: As AI technologies continue to advance and the ability of AI systems to generate valuable intellectual property increases, there is a growing need to find a balance between encouraging innovation and protecting the rights of creators, both human and machine. Some suggest that new legal structures, such as copyright collective licensing or shared authorship models, may be necessary to address these challenges and ensure a fair distribution of benefits in the AI-powered content economy.\n\n6. International cooperation: Given the global nature of AI and its impact on intellectual property, international cooperation is essential to establish consistent and equitable rules for the protection and use of AI-generated works. Efforts are underway to address these issues at the international level, such as through the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and other forums.\n\nIn summary, the global trend regarding intellectual property and works generated by artificial intelligence is one of evolving legal frameworks and ongoing debates over the role of AI in the creation process, the nature of authorship, and the balance between innovation and control. As AI technologies continue to advance, it is expected that further developments will emerge in this area to address these challenges and ensure a fair and sustainable digital economy.", "shortest_response": "The global trend regarding intellectual property (IP) and works generated by artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving and complex, as traditional IP laws were primarily designed for human creators. Here are some key trends:\n\n1. Recognition of AI as creators: Some countries, such as the United States, don't recognize AI as having legal rights. However, other countries like the UK and EU are moving towards considering AI as a contributor to works, which would impact IP ownership.\n\n2. Copyright law developments: As AI produces an increasing number of creative works, copyright laws are being revised in some regions. For example, the EU is considering extending copyright protections to AI-generated works, subject to certain conditions.\n\n3. Patent law changes: Patenting AI inventions remains a challenge due to the abstract nature of AI. Some countries like Japan and the US have specific guidelines for patenting AI-related technologies, while others are still developing their approaches.\n\n4. Data ownership and privacy: AI relies on vast amounts of data for training and creating output. This raises questions about data ownership and privacy, as well as the potential for misuse or unintended consequences of AI-generated content.\n\n5. International collaboration: Governments, corporations, and experts are working together to develop guidelines and policies to address the complexities of AI and IP. Organizations like the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) are leading discussions on best practices and standards.\n\n6. Focus on fair use and ethical considerations: There is a growing emphasis on ensuring that AI advances are used responsibly, and that creators, as well as the broader public, benefit from the innovations. This includes exploring the concept of fair use of AI-generated works and promoting transparency in AI systems.\n\n7.

Here's a simplified guide on how to approach this:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: First, you need to gather app review data. Google Play Store doesn't provide an API for direct review data access, but you can use web scraping tools or third-party APIs that provide access to certain parts of the Play Store data. Be sure to abide by Google's terms of service when scraping data.\n\n2. **Preprocessing**: Clean the collected data by removing irrelevant information, such as HTML tags, special characters, and numbers. Convert all text to lowercase for consistency.\n\n3. **Text Features Extraction**: Convert the reviews into numerical vectors to be used for machine learning models. Common techniques include Bag of Words (BOW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and Word2Vec.\n\n4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of each review to determine if it is positive, negative, or neutral. This can help prioritize the feedback and focus on areas with the most room for improvement. You can use pre-trained models like VADER, TextBlob, or BERT for this purpose.\n\n5. **Topic Modeling**: Cluster the reviews based on their topics to understand common issues and features that users mention. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular unsupervised machine learning model for this task.\n\n6. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most relevant features (words or phrases) associated with negative sentiments or specific issues. These will be used to train the recommendation system.\n\n7. **Building the Recommendation System**: Use supervised learning techniques such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or deep learning models like LSTM/RNN to build a classifier that predicts improvements based on the selected features. You can train the model on a labeled dataset where each review is associated with one or more improvements.\n\n8. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. Fine-tune the model based on its performance and iterate the process if necessary.\n\n9. **Deployment**: Once you're satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it to make app improvement recommendations.

Donald Draper, dressed immaculately, sits behind a vast mahogany desk, smoking a cigarette, and gazing contemplatively into the distance. The room is filled with an air of mystery and anticipation. The clock on the wall ticks ominously, the second hand sweeping around like a metronome, announcing the arrival of the future. The door opens, and a secretary enters, ushering in a crowd of high-powered executives. Draper stands, extending a hand in welcome.)\n\nDraper: (Pauses, letting the tension build, then speaks softly, with a smile) Welcome, colleagues. I see a room filled with the best minds, the sharpest tools in a rapidly changing world. Today, I would like to discuss a new way forward, a path that is uncharted, yet teeming with possibilities. But before we proceed, let's take a moment to reflect on the journey that brought us here.\n\n(The room falls silent as Draper lights his cigarette. Smoke wafts elegantly through the air like a fog of thoughts, a haze of memories.)\n\nDraper: Remember when we first started? When the world was black and white, and people marveled at the magic of moving images? We led the charge, breaking down barriers, and changing the way society perceived itself. We turned products into desires, dreams into realities, and transformed the ordinary into the extraordinary.\n\n(Draper takes a puff of his cigarette, as the room swells with pride and nostalgia.)\n\nDraper: But times have changed. The world has moved on, and so must we. The color has bled into the black and white, and now the world is a kaleidoscope of hues. The moving images of our yesteryears have given way to a new era, an era of instant connection, endless information, and unbridled potential.\n\n(Draper paces the room, his movements like a predator stalking its prey. The executives lean in, their eyes locked on his every move.)\n\nDraper: The old paradigm is dead. We must adapt or be left behind. Today, we stand on the precipice of a new world, a world where the old rules no longer apply, and the new rules have yet to be written.\n\n(Draper turns, facing the executives, his voice dropping to a near whisper, his eyes glinting with excitement.)\n\nDraper: Ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure that I introduce to you the next generation of advertising: the Zenith Project.\n\n(A collective gasp ripples through the room. The executives exchange incredulous glances.)\n\nDraper: (Leaning in, speaking softly) The Zenith Project is not just a new campaign, a fresh strategy, or a clever slogan. No, the Zenith Project is a blueprint for the future, a vision for a world where advertising is no longer a medium but a life force. A world where the power of our ideas transcends time, space, and even our own imaginations.\n\n(Draper pauses, taking a moment to let the words sink in.)\n\nDraper: The Zenith Project is built on a foundation of cutting-edge technology, data analytics, and artificial intelligence. It is a symphony of code, algorithms, and human intuition that heralds the dawn of a new age.\n\n(Draper gestures to a screen on the wall, which gradually fades to life.)\n\nDraper: (Looking out across the room) This is the face of Zenith - a world where products are tailored to the individual, messages are crafted to resonate with the soul, and ideas are born not in boardrooms but in the hearts and minds of our audience.\n\n(The screen displays a succession of images - a woman scrolling through her personalized news feed, a man receiving a targeted ad on his smartwatch, another laughing as a voice assistant delivers a joke tailored to his humor.)\n\nDraper: (Continuing) Imagine a world where advertisements are no longer an interruption but an invitation, where our clients' messages are not only heard but understood, and where the people we reach don't merely consume our offerings, but live them, breathe them, and share them.\n\n(The screen transforms into a single, static image - the word Zenith, written in an elegant, bold font.)\n\nDraper: (Raising an eyebrow, letting the room absorb the image) Zenith. It is a word that means the highest point, the culmination of our efforts, the apex of our ambitions. It is a beacon of hope, a promise of the future, and a testament to the boundless potential that lies within each and every one of us.\n\n(Draper pauses, watching the screen as the executives murmur amongst themselves, their eyes filled with a mixture of awe and apprehension.)\n\nDraper: So, what do you say? Are you ready to join me, to take a leap into the unknown, and to chase the horizon of tomorrow? Are you ready to redefine what it means to advertising, to ourselves, and to the world?\n\n(The executives exchange glances, some nodding, others maintaining a stoic silence. Draper steps closer to them, his voice soft but compelling.)\n\nDraper: I understand that change is scary. It is uncomfortable, unfamiliar, and, at times, unsettling. But I also know that it is necessary, that it is the driving force behind progress, and that it will ultimately lead us to new heights.\n\n(Draper takes a deep breath, his hands clenched into fists.)\n\nDraper: So, let us embrace the unknown, conquer our fears, and seize the moment. Let us forge ahead, armed with our ideals and propelled by our passions, and let us create a future that is brighter than any sunrise, more magnificent than any sunset, and more enduring than any memory.\n\n(Draper takes a final look at the executives, his eyes alight with determination and conviction.)\n\nDraper: Ladies and gentlemen, the future is not something we inherit; it is something we create. It is up to us to choose how we shape the world that awaits us, and together, we can make it a world that is worthy of our dreams, our ambitions, and our legacies.\n\n(The executives, inspired by Draper's words, begin to clap, their applause growing louder and more fervent. Draper smiles, taking a puff of his cigarette as he watches the sea of hands, his thoughts swirling with anticipation and excitement.)\n\nDraper: (Under his breath, as the applause continues) The future is now. The future is Zenith.\n\n(The screen displays Draper's reflection, the words \"Join the Revolution\" flashing across it, as the applause continues.)\n\n(The scene ends with Draper walking away, leaving the executives to their thoughts, the air alive with the promise of a new era.)\n\n(Fade to black.)\n\nTHE END\n\n---------------------------\n\n(Scene: A montage of images - people gazing at their smartphones, billboards displaying highly targeted ads, voice assistants responding to queries, and teams of creative minds brainstorming ideas - all set to an upbeat, modern score.)\n\n( Voiceover: Donald Draper, sounding confident and invigorated)\n\nDraper: The Zenith Project is not just an idea.

A major challenge in providing personalized content and understanding who our consumers are at the analytical level is the multi-faceted ecosystem by which they interact with Meredith and our brands. A majority of our consumers are anonymous and not logged in. Our presence across [traditional.com](http://traditional.com/) applications and over-the-top programming, as well as the podcast, recipes, and videos, create multiple streams of data that are difficult to create a singular view of the customer. In order for us to develop a true 360 customer view and recommend content that is personalized at an individual and audience-based level, requires stitching together touchpoints over time, device, and data stream.\n\nIn digital analytics, change is constant. For non-logged in users, our best approach to understanding these customers is through unique cookies, which drop on the consumer's device. Cookie loss, device diversity, and ITP 2.3 browsers all push analytics such that measuring unique viewers of content is fuzzy at best. These cookies, with high turnover and customers using multiple devices, mean understanding our audience and providing personalized content and advertisement that is relevant is difficult.\n\nThis leads us to our first major problem: how can we make cookies live longer since they are the only source for understanding the anonymous customer? And why does cookie turnover matter? Why does cookie lifetime matter? Even when you identify the audience that you want to engage or develop models which predict other types of content they'll be interested in with high accuracy, if the model that the cookie ID that was used in the model doesn't appear again, then the money, time, and effort that goes into building those models is lost as well. The fact is, a model is only as good as its activation. Knowing your audience is not good enough. You need to see them again in order to act upon it. Otherwise, you're just advertising in the dark.\n\nUnderstanding a customer's preference, interest, and behavior is dependent entirely on the data available. As shown previously, a typical Meredith user can have a variety of touchpoints with our brands. However, stitching that data together into a confluence is difficult when there can be missing or inconsistent primary keys and slightly different timestamps among different data streams. This is where graph databases can excel. By using a relationships-first mentality, it no longer matters which stream of data a cookie came from, only that you capture the timestamp and its observed connections. This creates a confluence of data which allows us to have a holistic view of the digital user. It is through connections across multiple streams of data, as well as understanding the relationships between cookies within a given stream, that cookie recovery is possible. This allows us to have profiles based on groups of cookies from the same individual, rather than assuming that each cookie represents a unique individual.\n\nSince more cookies are grouped into a profile, there are more touchpoints per profile, which leads to stronger modeling and better activation. The concept of an identity graph is not unique to Meredith. Many identity vendors sell their own identity graph product by which you send your anonymous cookie data and they send back connections to which they have based on a proprietary identity graph that they own. The issue here is it can be difficult to validate and verify the accuracy of these products, especially when a large portion of the traffic that you send is anonymous. By using graphs and first-party data, Meredith was empowered to analyze and accept or refute what appeared to be probabilistic connections that didn't match our deterministic data. We were able to find suspicious linkages through visualization of the graph and drop probabilistic identity vendors that didn't provide for us. Furthermore, having our own identity solution provided transparency that many identity vendors do not provide.\n\nTo recap, Meredith faced three major challenges here: cookie longevity, which affected model performance and activation; the fact that we have multiple streams of data that don't have clear linkages between them to explain customer behavior; and identity vendors selling opaque products which led to probabilistic matches that were incorrect. Given these problems, the solution Meredith Corporation found was using Neo4j for our own internal identity graph. The remainder of this presentation will describe how we deployed from proof of concept to full production scale. Throughout this process, there were many learning experiences and growing pains. Every time we increased our data size, we hit another wall that stopped us from continuing until we eventually broke through. I will detail the methods employed to make graphs in Neo4j scalable at the multi-terabyte level, as well as explain how working with Neo4j engineers, we were able to push the boundaries of what is possible with Neo4j graph algorithms. What I hope you take away from this presentation is that working with technologies in a new way and scaling can create challenges and barriers that may be difficult to overcome. But by the end of this presentation, I hope you can see how we address some of these challenges and we're able to bring our ideas to production.", "longest_response": "In this scenario, Meredith Corporation is facing challenges in understanding its customers and providing personalized content due to the complex ecosystem of interactions across multiple digital platforms. The primary obstacle is the high turnover and loss of cookies used to track anonymous customers, which also affects the activation and usefulness of marketing models.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, Meredith has developed an internal identity graph using Neo4j graph database. The graph database approach allows for more connections to be made between multiple streams of data, creating a holistic view of digital users. This method also helps in cookie recovery and building more accurate audience profiles.\n\nThe use of Neo4j for the identity graph addresses three main issues faced by Meredith:\n1. Cookie longevity: By grouping cookies into profiles, the number of touchpoints per profile increases, resulting in stronger modeling and improved activation.\n2. Missing or inconsistent primary keys and timestamp differences across data streams: The relationships-first mentality of Neo4j allows for stitching together data from various streams, making it easier to create a unified view of the customer.\n3. Difficulty in validating and verifying identity vendors' opaque products: By building its own identity graph, Meredith can analyze and verify the accuracy of connection probabilities generated by identity vendors.\n\nThe presentation will further detail Meredith's deployment of Neo4j from proof of concept to full-scale production, discussing the process's challenges, learning experiences, growing pains, and how the organization worked with Neo4j engineers to push the boundaries of graph algorithms and scalability for multi-terabyte level data.\n\nIn summary, Meredith Corporation is using Neo4j to create a unified identity graph that helps address the challenges of understanding anonymous customers, cookie longevity, and data stream connectivity in a multi-faceted digital ecosystem.

To address this, the organization has decided to focus on increasing the longevity of cookies and developing an internal identity graph using Neo4j.\n\nThe difficulties encountered in this endeavor include a short cookie lifetime, multiple data streams with inconsistent primary keys and timestamps, and the use of probabilistic identity solutions from third-party vendors that often lead to inaccuracies. By building its own identity graph using Neo4j, Meredith can link together data across different platforms to gain a holistic understanding of customer behavior and preferences.\n\nThrough the use of a graph database, Meredith aims to create relationships between different data points and increase the accuracy of its customer profiles. This will enable better personalization of content and advertising, leading to a more engaging and relevant experience for the end-user.\n\nAs the company moves forward with the implementation of its internal identity graph, it will face various challenges related to scalability and the integration of graph algorithms.

You \\*never\\* give the student the answer, but always try to ask just the right question to help them learn to think for themselves.

First, let's review the chain rule, a fundamental rule in calculus that helps us find derivatives of composite functions. Can you recall what the chain rule states? It might be helpful to rephrase it in simpler terms.\n\nOnce you have a clear understanding of the chain rule, let's consider the function `f(x) = sin(u(x))`, where `u(x) = x^2`. Now that we have a function in the format of the chain rule, we can start identifying `f` and `u`.\n\nCan you identify `f(x)` and `u(x)` in this case, considering that `f(x)` is the function we are trying to find its derivative, and `u(x)` is the inner or outer function of the composite function?\n\nNow that we have identified `f(x)` and `u(x)`, we can begin applying the chain rule. This will involve finding the derivative of `u(x)` (which you may recall as the power rule) and then applying the chain rule.\n\nStart by taking the derivative of `u(x)` with respect to `x`. Can you remember the power rule and how you can use it to find the derivative of `u(x)`? Once you have found the derivative of `u(x)`, you will have a piece of the chain rule's denominator ready.\n\nWith the derivative of `u(x)` at hand, apply the chain rule by multiplying it with the derivative of `sin(u(x))`. Can you remember how to find the derivative of `sin(u(x))` in terms of `cos(u(x))`? If so, you should be set to apply the chain rule and find the derivative of `sin(x^2)`.\n\nGood luck with finding the derivative, and let me know if any of the steps confuse you so we can work through them together!", "shortest_response": "To find the derivative of a function like `sin(x^2)`, it's often helpful to understand and apply the chain rule. Recall that the chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the product of the derivatives of the individual functions, evaluated at the appropriate points. In this case, `sin(u)` and `u=x^2`.\n\nSo, to begin, can you identify the two functions being combined in `sin(x^2)`? And once you've done that, can you express the derivative of each function independently? After writing the derivatives of each function, then you can use the chain rule to compute the overall derivative of `sin(x^2)`.

Here is the writeup to process: In 1905 Nehru sailed for England when he\nwas having Rahu Bhukti in Ketu Dasa. Mark the positions of these two\nplanets in Rasi and Navamsa. Venus Dasa Venus Bhukti (1912) saw\nhim back in India\u2014a Politically quiet and dull India that offered no scope\nfor the aggressive nationalism that the youth had already imbibed.\n\nHe settled down to the practice of law (Mercury, Sun, Venus and Mars\naspecting the 12th, indeed a powerful combination) which offered\npossibility of a brilliant future but fate-rather, luck ordained otherwise.\nNehru married in 1916. Kalatrakaraka Venus was responsible for this.\nKetu Bhukti in Venus Dasa saw him as President of the Indian National\nCongress\u2014a great honour and also a great responsibility. Venus is in\nthe 4th having caused a powerful Rajayoga while Ketu is in the 6th\u2014the\nsub and major lord being disposed in the 3rd and 11th from each\nother\u2014an ideal combination. With the commencement of the Sun Dasa\nNehru's popularity began to wax further. The Sun is in a Keeta Rasi. He\nis a political planet. He aspects the 10th house. In the Navamsa he is\nwith Saturn. The commencement of the Sun Dasa therefore saw him in\nprison. Jawharlal's father died during Rahu Bhukti in Sun Dasa. Rahu\naspects Jupiter, lord of the 9th and the major lord Sun is Pitrukaraka.\nThe sub-lord is in the 8th from Pitrukaraka. Again the end of Rahu\nBhukti in Sun Dasa saw Nehru in jail. His release took place in Sun\nDasa Venus Bhukti (1935). In the same period, his wife died. The major\nlord Sun owns the 2nd (family) in Rasi and the 7th in Navamsa. The\nsub-lord is of course Kalatrakaraka. Between themselves they are in the\n2nd and 12th from each other. His last detention took place in Moon\nDasa Mercury Bhukti. Both the major and sub-lords are hemmed\ninbetween malefics, the sub-lord owns the 3rd and 12th and is in\nconjunction with the lord of the 11th. Rahu was then transiting radical\nSaturn being the 2nd from the Moon. Mars is a yogakaraka and he\naspects the 10 house powerfully. \n\nAs soon as his Dasa began, Nehru\nbecame the Vice-President of the Indian Interim Government. Though\nRahu is in the 12th, his disposition from Mars is very significant with the\nresult the influence of the major lord prevailed and Nehru became India's first\nPrime Minister.

Rahu aspects Jupiter (lord of the 9th and Pitrukaraka) while the major lord Sun is Pitrukaraka. The sub-lord is in the 8th from Pitrukaraka, indicating the death of a close relative.                                                     |\n| Released from jail and wife's death | Sun Dasa Venus Bhukti (1935). The major lord Sun owns the 2nd (family) in Rasi and the 7th in Navamsa, and the sub-lord is Kalatrakaraka.

Both the major and sub-lords are hemmed in between malefics, with the sub-lord owning the 3rd and 12th and being in conjunction with the lord of the 11th.

For centuries, it has been an essential ingredient in traditional Hungarian and central European cuisine, contributing to the region's culinary legacy with its unique flavors and aromas. The intricate process of Asz\u00fa winemaking, which involves the selection of overripe grapes affected by noble rot, contributes to its complex flavor profile - a harmonious blend of honey, raisins, and spices, making it a versatile addition to various culinary dishes.\n\nParagraph 2:\nIn traditional Hungarian gastronomy, Asz\u00fa wine is frequently employed as a key ingredient in sweet dishes such as Soml\u00f3i Galuska (a layered chocolate and cream cake soaked in Asz\u00fa), Gundel pancake (a chocolate-covered pancake rolled with walnuts and raisins, covered in a cognac-flamb\u00e9ed sauce, and finished with a drizzle of Asz\u00fa), and Eszterh\u00e1zy t\u00f6rt (a rich, multiple-layered pastry with nuts, apricot jam, and a dense chocolate icing, served with a drizzle of Asz\u00fa). These desserts showcase the wine's ability to elevate flavors and create harmonious, multi-layered experiences for the palate.\n\nParagraph 3:\nAsz\u00fa wine's role extending beyond desserts is noteworthy. It pairs exceptionally well with a variety of savory dishes, such as foie gras, blue cheeses, and chocolate-based desserts. The wine's complexity, characterized by high acidity and a balance of sweetness, allows it to complement rich, strong flavors without overpowering them. This versatility has led to its inclusion in contemporary European and international cuisines, where it is used to create innovative and captivating culinary experiences.\n\nParagraph 4:\nIn recent years, Asz\u00fa wine has gained prominence as a key ingredient in cocktails, showcasing its culinary adaptability. The wine's natural sweetness and rich flavor profile make it a perfect partner for spirits like Cognac, Armagnac, and whiskey, creating exotic, complex, and intriguing drinks such as the Tokajito (a riff on the classic Mojito, substituting Asz\u00fa for simple syrup) and the Asz\u00fa Old Fashioned (replacing sugar with Asz\u00fa wine). These innovative cocktails emphasize Asz\u00fa wine's versatility, demonstrating its potential to transcend traditional culinary boundaries and enrich the world of mixology.\n\nParagraph 5:\nThe cultural significance of Asz\u00fa wine in gastronomy is further illustrated by its designation as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Hungary in 2002. This recognition acknowledges the wine's role in preserving traditional winemaking techniques, as well as its contributions to local cuisine and the vibrant gastronomic culture of the Tokaj region. The artisanal production of Asz\u00fa wine, passed down through generations, ensures its enduring presence in the world of gastronomy for generations to come.\n\nParagraph 6:\nAsz\u00fa wine's versatility, complex flavor profile, and rich cultural heritage make it an essential component in the world of gastronomy. Its ability to harmonize with a wide array of flavors, from the most delicate to the boldest, demonstrates its culinary versatility. As contemporary chefs and mixologists continue to explore the wine's potential, it remains a symbol of Hungarian culinary tradition while contributing to the evolving global food and drink landscape. The enduring allure of Asz\u00fa wine in gastronomy ensures its continued presence as a cherished treasure in the culinary world for years to come.", "shortest_response": "Title: The Role of Asz\u00fa Wine in Gastronomy\n\nParagraph 1:\nAsz\u00fa wine, a rare and exquisite golden delight, hails from the Tokaj region in Hungary. This unique dessert wine stands out as a prized culinary gem, not just for its rich history and cultural significance, but also for its harmonious pairing abilities with a diverse range of flavors in gastronomy.\n\nParagraph 2:\nDating back to the 16th century, Asz\u00fa wine's journey has been a testament to its quality and versatility. The wine is made from grapes affected by the noble rot, a controlled fungus that dries the grapes, concentrating their sugar and acid content. This processes results in a complex wine with aromas of honey, apricot, and raisins, making it an ideal companion for rich, sweet, and spicy dishes.\n\nParagraph 3:\nIn the realm of gastronomy, Asz\u00fa wine's versatility shines. It pairs exceptionally well with traditional Hungarian dishes such as goose liver pat\u00e9, goulash, and chimney cake. The wine's sweetness counterbalances the richness of these dishes, while its acidity provides a refreshing contrast. Moreover, its complexity allows it to complement the diverse flavors, textures, and spices used in these traditional dishes.\n\nParagraph 4:\nAsz\u00fa wine also finds its place in modern gastronomy, where it is used to elevate contemporary dishes with its delicate sweetness. It can be paired with dishes like foie gras, blue cheeses, or chocolate desserts. Its ability to balance sweetness with acidity ensures a harmonious dining experience, creating a perfect symphony of flavors.\n\nParagraph 5:\nThe wine's aging potential, with some vintages lasting centuries, adds another layer to its culinary relevance. Mature Asz\u00fa wines can be served as a dessert in themselves, providing a sophisticated conclusion to a meal. Their evolving flavors, which develop notes of nuts, caramel, and dried fruits over time, make each sip an intriguing sensory journey.\n\nParagraph 6:\nIn conclusion, Asz\u00fa wine plays a significant role in gastronomy, offering a rich tapestry of flavors that complement and elevate diverse dishes.

How would you approach this?", "longest_response": "Creating a program to play the Codenames game as a spymaster is an interesting and challenging project! Here's a high-level approach to help you get started:\n\n1. **Understand the game rules**: The Codenames game consists of 25 word cards, each with a word on it, associated with one of two teams. Your team (codenamed RED or BLACK) and the opposing team. Additionally, one word is the \"key word\" for each team, and it has a number of associated words (up to a maximum of 8). Your goal is to guess all the words of your team by giving one-word clues and an associated number, aiming to avoid cards of the other team.\n\n2. **Data collection**: Create a dataset containing tens of thousands of words with their corresponding categories or associations. You can use existing databases, online APIs, or scrape data yourself to build a comprehensive dataset for your program to work from.\n\n3. **Word association modeling**: Train a machine learning model (like a Word2Vec or TF-IDF model) to understand the semantic relationships between words in your dataset. This model can help find associations between the given clue and the words in your team.\n\n4. **Clue generation**: Write functions that use the trained model to generate clues for the words in your team and assign appropriate numbers based on the associated words' proximity to the clue.\n\n5. **Implementing the game logic**: Write the game loop to play the Codenames game, handling your turn, guessing your team's words, and checking for game-winning conditions.\n\n6. **Evaluating the performance**: Analyze the performance of your program at playing the game, and optimize the model and clue generation functions to improve its effectiveness.\n\nHere's a Python example using the Gensim library for word embeddings and scikit-learn for clustering:\n\n```python\nfrom gensim.models import Word2Vec\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\n# Load your dataset\nwords, categories = load_dataset()\n\n# Train the Word2Vec model\nw2v_model = Word2Vec(words, min_count=5)\n\n# Fit KMeans clustering to the word embeddings\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=10)\nkmeans.fit_transform(w2v_model[words])\n\n# Function to generate clues for your words\ndef generate_clues(team_words):\n    clues = {}\n    for word in team_words:\n        # Embed the word and get its closest neighbors\n        nearby_words = w2v_model.most_similar(word, topn=10)\n\n        # Determine the centroid of the neighbors and assign a number based on the distance to the centroid\n        centroid = kmeans.cluster_centers_[kmeans.predict([w2v_model[word]])[0]]\n        cluster_num = 1 + centroid.argmax()\n\n        # Create the clue and add to the dictionary\n        clues[word] = (centroid_word(centroid), cluster_num)\n\n    return clues\n```\n\nThis code snippet creates a model to generate word embeddings, fits a KMeans clustering model to these embeddings, and defines a function to generate clues for a given set of words. To play the game using this, you would call the `generate_clues` function on the words in your team and use the generated clues.", "shortest_response": "Creating a program to play CodeNames as a spy master involves developing an algorithm that can anticipate valid words and their associations (codenames) based on given clues, in-game knowledge, and word frequencies. Here's a high-level approach to designing such a program:\n\n1. Pre-process a large English dictionary to extract words and calculate various features that can help in determining the potential codenames and their associations. Some features include:\n   a. Length of the word\n   b. Number of unique letters\n   c. Frequency of occurrence\n   d. Semantic similarity or relatedness to the given clues or already-guessed words\n\n2. Train a machine learning model, such as a neural network, to predict associate words for a given codename based on the extracted features. Use labeled data for training the model where the codenames and associated words are provided.\n\n3. Implement a function to predict potential codenames given a clue, using the trained model and possibly an additional word-embedding layer to further capture semantic relationships between words.\n\n4. During gameplay, generate a list of candidate codenames for each clue, and rank them based on their predicted probability of being correct.\n\n5. Allow the user to make a final decision on the codename to reveal, taking into account the game's specific rules, such as the number of attempts, unique words, and forbidden words.\n\n6. Continuously refine the model by taking into account feedback and performance during the game, re-training it with additional data to improve its accuracy and adapt to the game environment.\n\n7. Make the program user-friendly by handling user inputs, displaying game-related information, and allowing the user to save and load game progress.\n\n8.

This configuration is a great start to securing your web app against several types of attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection.\n\nLet me briefly explain the directives you have specified in your CSP configuration:\n\n* `default-src`: The default source for all resources. Setting it to 'self' means that by default, only resources that come from the same origin as the web app will be loaded.\n* `script-src`: The sources for script resources. In this case, you have allowed scripts to come from the same origin ('self') as well as 'unsafe-eval' which is rarely recommended but could be used when you trust the script source.\n* `style-src`: The sources for style sheets. With 'unsafe-inline', you have allowed inline styles in the HTML file. This might increase the attack surface of your application. It is generally safer to use `'nonce-' + nonce` for inline styles to help mitigate the risk of XSS attacks.\n* `img-src`: The sources for images. In this case, images will come from the same origin ('self') and the firebase storage service (data URLs and https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com).\n* `font-src`: The sources for fonts. Here, you have only allowed fonts from the same origin.\n* `connect-src`: The sources for connections. Similar to `img-src`, you have allowed connections to the firebase storage service.\n* `media-src`: The sources for media content like audio and video. Here, media will come only from the same origin.\n* `frame-src`: The sources for frames and objects. In this case, frames and objects will only be allowed to come from the same origin.\n\nTo make your CSP more secure, you can consider the following improvements:\n\n* Remove 'unsafe-inline' from `style-src` and use `style-src 'self' 'nonce-' + nonce` instead to allow for safer inline styling.\n* Use a CSP reporting API to log violations and help you monitor your CSP more effectively.\n* Periodically review your policy to ensure it is up-to-date as your application evolves.\n\nGood job securing your application with CSP!

Cool. Well, if you need my help at all, just let me know. And yeah, outside of that and me curse and curse one of our solution engineers here. So as I was saying to Lizzie, there definitely the brains behind the operation between the two of us. So be good to kind of dive into some of the more. Yeah tactical and detail stuff around the forecasting especially consumption today.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 09:06\nAbsolutely nice to meet you. Hi, Nathan. Nice to meet you as well.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 09:11\nHow you doing. Yeah. Doing great, man. Doing great.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 09:15\nExcited. Use case here around your Usage product. Based in Philadelphia. I've been with Clari for about three years and typically focus on Enterprise forecasting, deployments. So we have had a couple customers come through with the consumption use case. And so Stephen tapped me to consult on what you guys are doing, so hopefully we can help you out with Larry.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 09:41\nTrust. So look, I suppose by way of an agenda for the call today, we've got another 35 minutes set aside and thought it'd best just to kind of keep this pretty conversational. I mean, we can potentially jump in and show you elements of clarity as well, if needs be. I suppose the most important thing is that we get a full understanding for how you're currently. I suppose. Forecasting and measuring, but also then hosting data around that consumption piece as well so that we can kind of go away and put together a couple of different options and see if we can find a solution that's going to work for you on that. So yeah, I suppose maybe over to you initially to just give a little bit of an overview. Maybe. Nathan, Lizzie around how you're currently reporting. On that consumption at the moment. And I'm sure Kurt will have a few questions as we go. Or unless Krista was something that you wanted to kind of kick off with.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 10:32\nNothing to present, but if we could start at a high level and just understand the gotomarket approach for that product. And then how you're reporting and forecasting on that that would be very helpful.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 10:47\nYeah, no problem. I'll have a swing at them. So the product in question is called Martrus. So it's. A Payments business. You can see it more as like a fintech play. Not too dissimilar to like revolute or Monzo or you know, some of these kind of popular. He kind of more ewlowerdriven solutions that you see nowadays. So the go to market approaches like our vertical. Across all of our products is within shipping. So when we talk about that, it's like. Transportation Companies that move product by see. On Large tanker, bulk vessels. Right. And so the Martros product is aimed at the seafarers, because that's where the volume is in terms of.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 11:40\nPersonnel.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 11:42\nSo here's what selling to a shipping company. Who are responsible for those seafarers onboard vessels. And really the. Kind of three main products that we would try and sell into a shipping company. One is. The Crew Payment solution. So.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 12:02\nEvery time you pay your seatbearer, which typically once a month.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 12:07\nAnd even any of your employees. But more typically, the seafarers is where the value proposition makes sense. We would basically charge you $12 flat on that transaction. Right. Because those seeds bearers are typically getting paid in local currency. So that's a once a month transaction. And then. And this is where it gets a little bit complex. So that's quite predictable. That's a beta B type cell, right. Every Cfare is going to get paid every month.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 12:40\nPretty.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 12:41\nThere's then a B to B to C element because of our E wallet solution, which is once you paid those cf errors, they can also take advantage of our E wallet solution. And that helps them send money back home to their families. Right. So if the Cfarer decides to take that up. Then we typically see another $1212. Plus a small amount of fx revenue. So you could say $15 on when they paid or when they make another bank to bank transfer, which is typically like one or two. It's normally one to family back home. Right. And then you have card usage, which is like point of sale atma type transactions on that card. But that's going to be like really small fx revenue, which is tiny.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 13:34\nBut.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 13:36\nIt does make up part of the like the revenue portfolio for ewallet, but again really difficult to forecast people use for it but just want to kind of paint the picture and then the other the other. Part the mantra solution is kind of like whilst we're talking to you, we could also handle your vendor payment. So when you pay vendors. It'll be a same same platform. Ultimately, what are we doing? We're making payments faster with fewer transaction fees. With a much better compliance platform kind of wrapped around it. And again, we're going to find around $15 there per transaction when they pay their customers. So the vendor payments is quite predictable. If the customer give us their volume. We know the fee that we're going to get per, you know, bank to make transfer.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 14:24\nThe crew payments is quite predictable.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 14:27\nI just need to know how many crew you got and just confirm you pay them once a month. Is really tricky because that's that B to be to C element. Like, how many times are they gonna send money back home per month. How many times are they going to do atm withdrawals? They're buy a packet cigarettes. So they're gonna go and buy like a new car. Like.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 14:53\nJust really difficult.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 14:54\nAnd obviously we're making a few dollars on the fx as well every time they spend. And so, yeah, it's high. The average base that's highly, like. The challenge, as well as the ramp. So if you told me you've got 100 C fairs. Making. One payment, a month. $12 a month. That's quite easy for me to figure out what annually you're worth. Whatever. Right. But on the e wallet side. I don't know when your sea bearer is gonna choose to use it because they don't have to use it. No one can force them to use it if they don't want to. So like if you guys said, hey, we've got this amazing deal with revolution. If you use that card, you get all of these amazing perks. You might say I'm gonna stay with, like, Citibank.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Create a JavaScript file:**\nCreate a JavaScript file in your `static` or `media` directory. For this example, we will place the file in `myapp/static/myapp/js/admin_validation.js`.\n\n```js\n// myapp/static/myapp/js/admin_validation.js\n\n// Assuming your Django model is named 'MyModel' and you are validating an field named 'my_field'\nfunction validateMyField() {\n    // Get the form element from DOM\n    const myForm = document.getElementById('id_form');\n\n    // Get the value of the field to be validated\n    const myValue = myForm.elements['my_field'].value;\n\n    // Custom validation logic goes here\n    // For example, let's assume we are looking for a specific pattern\n    if (!/^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$/.test(myValue)) {\n        // Set error message if validation fails\n        myForm.elements['my_field'].setCustomValidity(\"Only alphanumeric characters are allowed.\");\n        myForm.elements['my_field'].reportValidity();\n    } else {\n        // Clear error message if validation passes\n        myForm.elements['my_field'].setCustomValidity(\"\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Attach the validation function to the form's 'submit' event\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n    const myForm = document.getElementById('id_form');\n    myForm.addEventListener('submit', validateMyField);\n});\n```\n\n2. **Register the JavaScript file in Django:**\nIn your Django admin.py, import `AdminSite` and `register` from `django.contrib` and register your model:\n\n```python\n# myapp/admin.py\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom .models import MyModel\nfrom django.utils.safestring import mark_safe\n\nclass MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    # Your custom admin properties like list_display, search_fields, etc.\n\nadmin.site.register(MyModel, MyModelAdmin)\n```\n\nThen, add the ` media` tag to include the JavaScript file in your admin's base template:\n\n```python\n# myapp/admin.py\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django.contrib.admin import AdminSite\nfrom .models import MyModel\nfrom django.utils.safestring import mark_safe\nfrom django.template.loader_tags import register\n\nclass MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    # Your custom admin properties like list_display, search_fields, etc.\n\nadmin_ Media = AdminSite.media + (\n    'myapp/js/admin_validation.js',\n)\n\nadmin.site.register(MyModel, MyModelAdmin)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `{% load static %}` and `{% javascript %}` template tags in the admin's base template like this:\n\n```html\n<!-- myapp/static/admin/base_site.html (or a custom admin template you created) -->\n{% load static %}\n<!-- ... -->\n{% block additional_js %}\n<script src=\"{% static 'myapp/js/admin_validation.js' %}\"></script>\n{% endblock %}\n```\n\n3. **Force the form re-rendering:**\nSince Django does not dynamically re-render forms after JavaScript validation, you will have to force re-rendering manually.\nYou can do this by implementing a custom `save_model` method:\n\n```python\n# myapp/admin.py\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django.utils.html import escape\nfrom .models import MyModel\nadmin_ Media = AdminSite.media + (\n    'myapp/js/admin_validation.js',\n)\n\nclass MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    # Your custom admin properties like list_display, search_fields, etc.\n\n    def save_model(self, request, obj, form, change):\n        # Call the parent method to persist the model changes\n        super().save_model(request, obj, form, change)\n        # Reload the page\n        window.location.reload();\n\nadmin.site.register(MyModel, MyModelAdmin)\n```\n\nThis will redirect you to the list page after the form is saved, ensuring that the JavaScript validation rules are applied on the next form load.\n\nThat's it! Now you have added JavaScript validation to your Django Admin form. You can extend this approach to validate other fields if needed.", "shortest_response": "To add JavaScript validation in Django Admin Form, you'll need to make use of a custom JavaScript file and Django's JavaScript hooks. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. Create a custom JavaScript file (let's call it `admin_validation.js`) in your `static/YourAppName/js/` directory with the following content:\n\n```javascript\nDjango.utils.jqueryReady(function($) {\n    // Add your validation logic here\n    $(document).ready(function() {\n        // Example for adding validation on model field 'title'\n        $('.django-ModelForm-title').blur(function() {\n            var title = $(this).val();\n            if (!title) {\n                $(this).addClass('errorfield');\n            } else {\n                $(this).removeClass('errorfield');\n            }\n        });\n    });\n});\n```\n\nReplace `Django.utils.jqueryReady` with `jQuery(document).ready` or `$(document).ready` if using 1.9.1 or a later version of jQuery.\n\n2. Make sure your `settings.py` file is configured to find your static files:\n\n```python\nSTATIC_URL = '/static/'\nSTATICFILES_DIRS = [\n    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),\n]\n```\n\n3. Modify the adminmodel as follows to include the custom JavaScript file:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom .models import YourModel\n\n@admin.register(YourModel)\nclass YourModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    list_display = ('field1', 'field2', 'field3')\n\n    class Media:\n        js = (\n            'YourAppName/js/admin_validation.js',\n        )\n```\n\nReplace `YourAppName` and `YourModel` with your Django app name and model name, respectively.\n\n4. Run the following commands to collect static files:\n\n```bash\npython manage.py collectstatic\n```\n\nAfter following these steps, your custom JavaScript validation will be added to the Django Admin Form.

By examining the relationship between logic and probability theory and the connection between causal and probabilistic perspectives, we provide a more comprehensive framework for understanding the complex relationships between theories, data, and the real world.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe philosophy of science has long been concerned with the problem of falsification and the limits of scientific knowledge. While the process of falsification, as proposed by Karl Popper, has been an influential method for scientific progress, it is important to recognize its limitations. This essay argues that the uncertainty in scientific knowledge can be better understood and formalized using probability theory, causal systems theory, and Bayesian approaches. In doing so, we hope to provide a more nuanced framework for understanding the complex relationships between theories, data, and the real world.\n\nThe Limits of Falsification and the Role of Uncertainty\nFalsification, the idea that scientific theories can be tested and potentially disproven, is a cornerstone of scientific progress. However, falsification faces the Duhem-Quine problem, which suggests that it is principally impossible to pinpoint what exactly is falsified based on logical grounds, as theories are embedded within a complex web of assumptions and auxiliary hypotheses.\n\nMoreover, falsification does not account for the inherent uncertainty present in scientific theories. To better account for this uncertainty, we propose a probabilistic approach, drawing on the works of Cox and Jaynes. By formalizing uncertainty using probability theory, we can establish a relationship between logical derivation and probability theory, allowing for a formal reformulation of the falsification principle and the Duhem-Quine problem in probabilistic terms.\n\nCausal Systems Theory, Bayes Nets, and Conditional Independence\nCausal systems theory posits that the world is composed of interconnected causal systems, which can be described using mathematical models. By employing Bayes Nets and the concept of conditional independence, we can create a probabilistic representation of causal systems that captures the uncertainty inherent in our understanding of these systems.\n\nThe relationship between causal systems and probability theory can be further explored by examining the Markov principle, which links causal systems to probabilistic descriptions. This principle allows us to derive probability distributions from causal systems, enabling a better understanding of the complex interactions between theories, data, and the real world.\n\nIntegrating Bayesian and Causal Approaches with the Duhem-Quine Problem\nTo address the Duhem-Quine problem and the inherent uncertainty in scientific theories, we propose integrating Bayesian and causal approaches. By linking theorizing to a latent data-generating process, we can account for the complex interplay between theories, secondary theories, auxiliary hypotheses, boundary conditions, and background knowledge.\n\nBy considering the relationship between logic and probability theory, as well as the connection between causal and probabilistic perspectives on a system's description, this approach allows scientists to generate models that may capture the data-generating process, either fully or partially. This integration provides a richer understanding of scientific inquiry and its inherent limitations, while offering a promising avenue for further exploration.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, we have argued that a more nuanced understanding of scientific theories and their uncertainty can be achieved by integrating probability theory, causal systems theory, and Bayesian approaches. By addressing the Duhem-Quine problem, examining the relationship between logic and probability theory, and exploring the connection between causal and probabilistic perspectives, this framework provides a more comprehensive understanding of scientific inquiry and its inherent limitations. While it may not fully resolve the challenges posed by falsification and uncertainty, it offers a promising\n```\nPlease use this structure as context, how I want the essay structured:\n```\nI.

Shell scripts are primarily intended for system administration tasks, file manipulation, and running commands. Here's why it's generally a better idea to use a dedicated programming language such as Python, Node.js, or C for writing servers:\n\n1. Networking functionality: Shell script lacks built-in support for handling sockets, which is essential for creating a server. You would have to use external libraries like `socket`, `netcat`, or `inotify` to create a server, making the script more complex and harder to read.\n\n2. Event handling: Modern servers need to handle multiple requests concurrently, which requires event-driven programming or threads. Shell scripts use a sequential model of execution that is inefficient for serving multiple requests simultaneously.\n\n3. Error handling and debugging: Shell scripts have a simpler error handling mechanism compared to dedicated programming languages. Debugging complex server programs written in shell scripts could be challenging as well.\n\n4. Scalability and performance: Dedicated programming languages offer better performance and scalability, making them more suitable for building high-performance servers.\n\n5. Code organization and maintenance: As your program grows, being able to structure your code in an organized manner with functions, classes, and modules makes it easier to maintain and modify. Shell scripts have limited support for code organization.\n\nFor a simple HTTP server, you can use a lightweight web framework like Python's Flask or Node.js Express. They provide an easy-to-learn syntax, good documentation, and are well-suited for creating small to medium-sized servers. If you have specific requirements, more advanced web frameworks like FastAPI or Django are available for Python, and for Node.js you can consider using Next.js or Express.js among various other options.\n\nTo learn more about building web servers with Python and Flask, you can check out this article: https://realpython.com/flask-by-example-part-1/\n\nFor a Node.js server with Express.js, you can refer to this article: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html\n\nIn short, while you can write a simple server in a linux shell script, it is generally recommended to use a dedicated programming language for building production-level servers due to the advantages in functionality, performance, and maintenance.", "shortest_response": "While it's theoretically possible to write a server program using shell scripts in Linux, it's not typically recommended due to the following reasons:\n\n1. Lack of structure: Shell scripts are great for automating tasks, but they lack the structure and features that programming languages like C, Python, Java, etc., provide for building complex applications such as a server.\n\n2. Limited built-in functionality: Shell scripts are not designed for creating high-performance networking servers. They lack many advanced networking features available in dedicated server programming languages.\n\n3. Readability and maintenance: Shell scripts are generally easier to write but more difficult to read and maintain, especially for complex server applications.\n\n4. Error handling: Shell scripts have basic error handling capabilities compared to programming languages that offer more sophisticated ways to handle and report errors.\n\nFor a server application, it's better to use a more suitable programming language like Python, Node.js, Java, or C++. If you're new to server programming, Python and Node.js may be good starting points due to their simplicity and extensive resources available online.", "input_size": 15, "output_sizes": [392, 274, 362, 535, 344, 475, 317, 417, 302, 234], "output_mean": 365.2, "output_std": 87.52, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 305.75, "p50": 353.0, "p75": 410.75, "p99": 529.6}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 11.81019}, {"sample_id": "d6b6ab20b9ce07bf", "prompt_id": "6d46f19baf1f6e21", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "show a discussion between an atheist and a jewish rabbi where they disagree about faith", "longest_response": "Note: The following dialogue is a fictional discussion and aims to illustrate the differences in perspectives between an atheist and a Jewish Rabbi on the topic of faith. It is not intended to represent the views of all atheists or Jewish Rabbi's, as beliefs can greatly vary within these groups.\n\nAtheist: Rabbi, I find it hard to understand your strong belief in God and the religious practices that come with it. To me, there is no evidence to support the existence of a deity.\n\nRabbi: I appreciate your openness to discussing this topic. My faith in God is not solely based on evidence, but on the deeply personal, inner experience of connection to the divine. Through the study of Jewish texts, prayer, and the experiences of our ancestors, I have developed a relationship with God that transcends objective proof.\n\nAtheist: But isn't it dangerous to base important aspects of one's life on subjects that lack empirical evidence? If we cannot objectively verify the existence of God, why should we devote our lives to him?\n\nRabbi: I agree that objectivity is essential in many areas of life. However, the search for a deep understanding of the universe and our purpose within it is a unique and subjective endeavor. My faith allows me to find meaning, guidance, and a sense of belonging. The question of God's existence is not the only concern; rather, it is about how we live our lives and strive to grow as individuals and as a community.\n\nAtheist: I can understand that seeking personal meaning and fulfillment is important, but wouldn't it be more logical to focus our efforts on improving our world through science, critical thinking, and empirical evidence rather than relying on mysticism and faith?\n\nRabbi: Science and critical thinking are crucial tools for understanding our world, and I wholeheartedly support their advancement. However, I believe that there are aspects of human experience that cannot be fully explained by scientific methods, such as emotions, morality, and the search for meaning. These are the areas where faith can complement science and help us navigate the complexities of life.\n\nAtheist: I see your point, but the fact remains that, for many people, religion can lead to intolerance, prejudice, and violence. How can we justify blind faith when it may lead to such detrimental consequences?\n\nRabbi: I strongly condemn any form of intolerance, prejudice, or violence that stems from religious beliefs. It is important to remember that religions are diverse and evolving, and different interpretations and practices can lead to conflict. The key to promoting harmony within and between religious communities is to cultivate empathy, understanding, and respect for one another. Faith should never be a cause for division or harm.\n\nAtheist: I agree, but it is challenging to reconcile the idea of faith without evidence with the pursuit of objective truth and rational thought. Wouldn't it be more logical to focus on building a better world based on reason and facts?\n\nRabbi: I understand your skepticism, and I believe that reason and facts are important. However, I would argue that faith and reason are not mutually exclusive. In my opinion, faith enriches our understanding of the world by helping us to make sense of the unexplained, and it provides a moral framework that guides our actions. By combining reason and faith, we can work towards creating a better world that is grounded in both empirical evidence and spiritual principles.\n\nAtheist: Rabbi, thank you for the thoughtful and insightful conversation. Although we may not agree on the existence of God, I appreciate your perspective and the consideration you put into explaining your beliefs.\n\nRabbi: And I thank you, [Atheist], for engaging in this conversation with an open mind. It is through these discussions that we can learn from one another and continue to grow as individuals and as a society. May we always strive to live with empathy, understanding, and respect for one another, regardless of our beliefs.", "shortest_response": "Here's a fictional and respectful exchange between an atheist and a Jewish Rabbi discussing their views on faith:\n\nAtheist (A): Rabbi, I've been considering the question of faith and I find it challenging. I can't observe a deity directly, nor have I received any persuasive evidence to believe in God.\n\nRabbi (R): I appreciate your sincerity and openness, (A). Let me share my perspective as a Jew who has been raised with faith in God.\n\nA: Of course, I'd love to hear your thoughts. I don't mean to offend, but the burden of proof feels heavy when it comes to matters of faith.\n\nR: I understand that. Faith, as discussed in many religious traditions, is not about proof in the same sense as empirical evidence; it's more about personal experience, tradition, and shared wisdom. For me, my faith in God stems from my Jewish upbringing and the moral and emotional guidance it has provided throughout my life.\n\nA: I see what you're saying. However, isn't it possible to have a moral and fulfilling life without faith in a deity?\n\nR: That's a valid question, and many people lead meaningful lives without religious faith. But what I find personally compelling is the sense of community, ritual, and connection to a rich tapestry of ancestry, history, and culture that my faith offers me. To others, that may be different.\n\nA: It's fascinating to see the differences in our experiences. For me, finding answers to life's mysteries through empirical evidence and a sense of personal autonomy is more important than adhering to faith traditions.\n\nR: I can appreciate that, (A). Ultimately, I believe that we each must find the path that resonates most deeply with our own values and experiences. I am grateful that we can engage in this discussion with mutual respect and curiosity.

Include examples (multiple sclerosis).", "longest_response": "Type 4 hypersensitivity, also known as delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), is an immune response that develops over a period of 24\u201372 hours. It is a cell-mediated response primarily involving T cells, particularly CD4+ T cells (T-helper cells) and CD8+ T cells (T-cytotoxic cells).\n\nUnlike Type 1 hypersensitivity (allergic reaction), which is immediate, Type 4 hypersensitivity is characterized by a delayed response that results in inflammation. This response occurs when sensitized T cells encounter their specific antigen, often in the context of a prolonged contact and an intact antigen-presenting cell (APC).\n\nThe key steps in the Type 4 hypersensitivity reaction are:\n\n1. Antigen presentation: Antigens, such as bacteria or damaged cells, are presented to T cells by Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs).\n\n2. Activation of T cells: The T cells become activated, proliferate, and differentiate into effector T cells.\n\n3. Migration to the site of antigen: The activated T cells migrate to the site of antigen through the bloodstream and lymphatic system.\n\n4. Activation of macrophages: The T cells recruit macrophages to the site by releasing cytokines, which are signaling proteins.\n\n5. Destruction of the antigen: The activated macrophages destroy the antigen through various mechanisms, including phagocytosis and release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enzymes.\n\nIn the context of an autoimmune disease like Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Type 4 hypersensitivity plays a significant role. In MS, the immune system mistakes myelin, the insulating layer around nerve fibers in the central nervous system (CNS), as foreign and mounts an immune response against it. T cells and macrophages attack the myelin sheath, leading to inflammation, demyelination, and scarring (sclerosis), which disrupts nerve impulses and can cause various neurological symptoms.\n\nExamples of Type 4 hypersensitivity reactions in the context of diseases include:\n\n1. Tuberculosis (TB): T cells and macrophages work together to destroy the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria.\n2. Contact dermatitis: Prolonged contact with an irritant or allergen leads to T cell-mediated inflammation in the skin. Common culprits include nickel, poison ivy, or latex.\n3. Type IV nephritis (Lupus Nephritis): Sensitized T cells mount an immune response against kidney antigens in systemic lupus erythematosus, leading to kidney inflammation and damage.\n4. Psoriasis: T cells, cytokines, and skin cells cooperate to cause the overgrowth and abnormal differentiation of skin cells, leading to the thick, scaly, and inflamed skin lesions characteristic of psoriasis.\n\nOverall, Type 4 hypersensitivity plays a crucial role in both immune defense against pathogens and the development of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In MS, the misguided immune response results in damage to normal tissues, leading to symptoms and disability. Understanding this type of immune response is essential for developing effective treatments and therapies for MS and other autoimmune diseases.", "shortest_response": "Type 4, or Type-IV, hypersensitivity, also known as delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), is an immune response that occurs after several hours, unlike Type 1 hypersensitivity, which is immediate. It's a cell-mediated response primarily involving T-lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell.\n\nIn Type 4 hypersensitivity, an initial antigen encounter induces the differentiation of naive T-cells into memory T-cells. These memory T-cells remain dormant until they encounter the same antigen again, at which point they become activated and secrete cytokines, which induce the inflammatory response.\n\nDTH reactions are characterized by the formation of an inflammatory lesion, or granuloma. In contrast to the rapid onset of symptoms in Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions, Type 4 reactions might take several hours or days to develop.\n\nOne common example of Type 4 hypersensitivity is the skin reaction seen in the Mantoux test, used for tuberculosis screening. Another example is contact dermatitis, a skin inflammation caused by allergic reactions to substances like metals, dyes, or certain drugs, leading to a rash or itchiness.\n\nRegarding multiple sclerosis (MS), while it's not typically classified as a Type 4 hypersensitivity reaction, it's an autoimmune disease where the immune system mistakenly attacks the central nervous system (CNS), including its myelin sheath. Myelin is a protective layer that helps nerves conduct electrical signals, and its destruction in MS leads to the wide range of symptoms seen in this disease.\n\nAlthough the exact cause of MS is unknown, it's believed that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may contribute to the disease's development. This immune-mediated process shares some similarities with Type 4 hypersensitivity reactions, as the immune system's T-cells become activated and targeted against self-antigens in the CNS. However, MS involves a more complex and dynamic process than a typical Type 4 hypersensitivity reaction.", "input_size": 23, "output_sizes": [480, 569, 584, 537, 549, 604, 786, 662, 600, 560], "output_mean": 593.1, "output_std": 78.59, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 551.75, "p50": 576.5, "p75": 603.0, "p99": 774.84}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 18.60975}, {"sample_id": "3336c8d3129b79bb", "prompt_id": "6231800b0824dd4c", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "create a CSV file which contains metadata of all the processed image that has been processed and store it in the processed folder along with the processed image.Share Prompt", "longest_response": "To create a CSV file and store it alongside each processed image in the \"processed\" folder, we'll make use of Python and its popular libraries for image processing (Pillow) and handling CSV files (pandas and csv).

However, it's important to note that the specific USB devices connected to the Raspberry Pi may affect the enumeration order.\n\nIn the Android Linux kernel, the USB bus is numbered starting from zero (0), and devices are numbered from zero (0) on each bus. Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. The first USB controller (hub) is assigned bus number 1-1 (bus number 1, device number 1, also known as /dev/bus/usb/001/001).\n\n2. If the first USB hub has connected USB devices, they will be enumerated starting from device number 2 (/dev/bus/usb/001/002, /dev/bus/usb/001/003, etc.).\n\n3. If the Raspberry Pi has another USB controller (hub), it will be assigned a higher bus number, like bus number 1-2 (/dev/bus/usb/001/003).\n\n4. Enumeration continues on the subsequent hub (bus number 1-2), with the devices attached being numbered from 1 (/dev/bus/usb/001/004, /dev/bus/usb/001/005, etc.).\n\nIn practice, you can use the `lsusb` command to list connected USB devices and examine their bus and device numbers:\n\n```\n$ lsusb\n```\n\nThis command will display a list of connected USB devices, along with their respective bus and device numbers. Keep in mind that the order in which the USB devices appear in the `lsusb` output may not correspond to the physical USB ports on the Raspberry Pi board.\n\nSome factors affecting the actual enumeration order include:\n\n- The order in which the USB devices are physically connected to the Raspberry Pi.\n- The power-up sequence of the connected USB devices.\n- The USB device type and class (e.g., if there are USB hubs or self-powered devices connected, they might influence the enumeration order).\n\nFor more precise knowledge about how the USB devices on your specific Raspberry Pi setup are enumerated, you may have to perform some experiments to determine the correlation between the physical USB ports and the enumerated USB devices using the `lsusb` command.", "shortest_response": "The enumeration of USB ports on a Raspberry Pi running Android OS is determined by the Android operating system's internal USB stack and the USB host controller driver.

To get a consistent order, it's recommended to assign specific USB IDs to the devices that require a fixed order, if possible.\n\nTo check the connected USB devices on a Raspberry Pi running Android, you can use the `dmesg` command, which logs kernel messages related to USB events.

This is also known as the Dependency Inversion principle, which emphasizes that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. In other words, we should program to interfaces (abstractions) rather than implementations.\n\nIn the Spring Framework, dependency management is achieved through the use of the Inversion of Control (IoC) container. The IoC container is responsible for creating and managing objects (beans), injecting dependencies among them, and handling their life cycle. This allows for decoupling of classes, reducing interdependencies, and making the system more modular and maintainable.\n\nHere's a simple example of dependency injection using Spring Framework:\n\n1. First, we define a service interface and a service implementation:\n\n```java\n// Service interface\npublic interface MessageService {\n    String getMessage();\n}\n\n// Service implementation\n@Component\npublic class SimpleMessageService implements MessageService {\n    @Override\n    public String getMessage() {\n        return \"Hello, Spring!\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Next, we write a controller class that depends on the `MessageService`:\n\n```java\n@Component\npublic class ExampleController {\n    private final MessageService messageService;\n\n    @Autowired\n    public ExampleController(MessageService messageService) {\n        this.messageService = messageService;\n    }\n\n    public String showMessage() {\n        return messageService.getMessage();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3. In the main application class, we configure the Spring container and allow it to scan for components:\n\n```java\n@SpringBootApplication\npublic class Application {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n4. When we run the application, Spring's IoC container will be instantiated, inject the `SimpleMessageService` into the `ExampleController`, handle the life cycle of both objects, and the dependency relationship will be established automatically.\n\nIn this example, the `ExampleController` no longer needs to create the `SimpleMessageService` instance, making the code cleaner and easier to test. This is the essence of dependency injection and the Inversion of Control pattern in the Spring Framework.", "shortest_response": "Dependency in the context of software development refers to a situation where a class or module relies on another class or module to function. This relationship is inherent in object-oriented programming languages and can lead to complex interdependencies among components.\n\nIn the Spring Framework, dependency management is addressed with Dependency Injection (DI), a design pattern that allows a separating the construction of an object from the code that uses that object. The core idea of DI is to pass dependencies to an object rather than the object creating them itself.\n\nUsing DI in Spring follows these steps:\n\n1. Declare dependencies: In Spring, you define the dependencies of your components by means of Dependency Injection Metadata such as annotations or XML configurations. For example, to declare a dependency on a `DataSource` bean, you can annotate a service class field like so:\n\n```\n@Autowired\nprivate DataSource dataSource;\n```\n\n2. Container builds and provides instances: Spring's Inversion of Control (IoC) container, also known as the Application Context, reads the configuration metadata, creates the instances of the defined components, and wires the dependencies as declared.\n\n3. Components use their injected dependencies: When your components need to use their dependencies, they can access them directly via the fields annotated with `@Autowired`.\n\nBy using dependency injection, Spring promotes loose coupling, improves testability, and simplifies configuration management.

As such bodies we reckon the sun and moon, the planets (of which the earth is one) and their satellites, comets and meteors, and finally the stars and nebulae. We have to consider in Astronomy: (a) The motions of these bodies, both real and apparent, and the laws which govern these motions. (b) Their forms, dimensions, and masses. () Their nature and constitution. (d) The effects they produce upon each other by their attractions, radiations, or by any other ascertainable influence. It was an early, and has been a most persistent, belief that the heavenly bodies have a powerful influence upon human affairs, so that from a knowledge of their positions and \\aspects at critical moments (as for instance at the time of a person's birth) one could draw up a \\horoscope\" which would indicate the probable future. The pseudo-science which was founded on this belief was named Astrology, the elder sister of Alchemy and for centuries Astronomy was its hand maid; ie., astronomical observations and calculations were made mainly in order to supply astrolaogical data. 2. Astronomy i divided into many branches, some of which, as ordinarily recognized, are the following: a. Descriptive Astronomy- This, as its name implies, is merely an orderly statement of astronomical facts and principles. b. Practical Astronomy - This is quite as much an art as a science, and treats of the instruments, the methods of observation, and the processes of calculation by which astronomical facts are ascertained. c.

It is sometimes called Gravitational\nAstronomy, because, with few exceptions, gravitation is the only force sensibly concerned in\nthe motions of the heavenly bodies. Until within thirty years this branch of the science was\ngenerally designated as Physical Astronomy, but the term is now objectionable because of\nlate it has been used by many writers to denote a very different and comparatively new\nbranch of the science. e. Astronomical Physics, or Astro-physics -This treats of the physical\ncharacteristics of the heavenly bodies, their brightness and spectroscopic peculiarities, their\ntemperature and radiation, the nature and condition of their atmospheres and surfaces, and\nall phenomena which indicate or depend on their physical condition. f. Spherical Astronomy\n-This, discarding all consideration of absolute dimensions and distances, treats the heavenly\nbodies simply as objects moving on the \\surface of the celestial sphere\": it has to do only\nwith angles and directions, and, strictly regarded, is in fact merely Spherical Trigonometry\napplied to Astronomy. 3.

Santosh Sivan's Halo (1996) falls squarely within the latter category, presenting a poignant tale of human resilience and the indomitable spirit embedded in the heart of every individual. Over the course of 700 words, I aim to delve into the heartrending narrative, stunning cinematography, and profound performances that make Halo an unforgettable cinematic experience.\n\nAward-winning director, cinematographer, and actor Santosh Sivan masterfully weaves a tale of Mano (Roshan Seth), an aging farmer, and his journey from despair to hope in the face of unimaginable hardship. Set against the backdrop of rural India, Halo is a visually stunning exploration of the human condition and the power of the human spirit in the face of adversity.\n\nThe film opens with images of verdant fields and bustling markets, painting a picture of a life brimming with promise. However, the idyllic setting soon gives way to Mano's desolation, as we witness the devastating effects of crop failure on his small farming community. With his livelihood in ruins and his family on the verge of starvation, Mano is left with no other choice but to sell his wife, Radha (Shabana Azmi), into slavery to provide for them.\n\nSivan's narrative is at once heart-wrenching and uplifting, with the story serving as a powerful reminder of the enduring human spirit. Mano's quest for redemption and his unwavering faith in a better future are underscored by the resilience of the human spirit, even in the face of the most unimaginable circumstances. The theme of hope is further emphasized through the film's vivid visuals, with Sivan utilizing light and color to convey the characters' emotions and the changing fortunes of Mano's life.\n\nThe film's visual storytelling is arguably its most striking aspect, with Sivan's masterful use of light and color creating a rich, immersive world that draws the viewer in and transports them to the heart of rural India. The film's vibrant palette, punctuated by deep hues of red, green, and gold, serves to highlight the beauty of the land and the resilience of its people. Additionally, Sivan's expert use of natural lighting lends an authenticity to the film, further enhancing its realistic depiction of rural life.\n\nShabana Azmi and Roshan Seth deliver exceptional performances as Radha and Mano, respectively, demonstrating the depth and range of human emotion in the face of adversity. Azmi's portrayal of Radha is particularly noteworthy, as she subtly conveys the character's struggles, resilience, and eventual transformation through her expressive eyes and body language. Seth, too, delivers a powerful performance, imbuing Mano with a quiet, stoic dignity that speaks volumes about the indomitable spirit within even the most seemingly ordinary individual.\n\nSivan's direction is equally commendable, as he deftly navigates the complex narrative while ensuring that the emotional core of the story remains front and center. Achieving such a delicate balance is no small feat, and Sivan's skillful handling of the material serves to elevate the film to new heights. The film's pacing, too, is expertly orchestrated, with Sivan allowing the narrative to unfold at a leisurely pace that allows the story and characters to breathe.\n\nIn conclusion, Santosh Sivan's Halo stands as a testament to the human spirit and the power of hope. With its evocative visuals, heartrending narrative, and captivating performances, Halo delivers a poignant and thought-provoking cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll. Whether viewed as a poignant exploration of the human condition or simply as a visually stunning film, Halo is a gem that should not be missed by any discerning moviegoer. It is a shining example of the power of independent filmmaking, and a testament to Sivan's undeniable talents as a director, cinematographer, and storyteller.", "shortest_response": "Title: A Vibrant Tale Unveiled: A Review of the 1996 Masterpiece, \"Halo\" by Santosh Sivan\n\nIn the realm of cinema, stories are woven to transport us to different worlds, immerse us in diverse cultures, and provoke our thoughts. One such captivating cinematic odyssey is \"Halo\" (1996), the directorial debut of Santosh Sivan, a visual artist whose work transcends the boundaries of conventional storytelling.\n\nSet in rural India, \"Halo\" unravels the tale of Mini (Thitu), a young girl whose innocence and spirited resilience serve as the film's heart and soul. Mini's life is forever changed when her father, a humble photographer, gifts her a Kodak Brownie Hawkeye camera \u2013 a symbol of freedom, exploration, and the opportunity to narrate her own story.\n\nThe narrative, though simple, is profoundly enriching, providing a poignant glimpse into the life of a young girl transitioning into womanhood in the heart of small-town India. The story is peppered with nuanced, character-driven performances that bring Mini and her compatriots to life. The actor who portrays Mini, Thitu, delivers an exceptional performance that effectively communicates the essence of the character - a child burdened with the weight of the world but determined to navigate it with grace and courage.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of \"Halo\" is its cinematography, a showcase of Santosh Sivan's unparalleled skill as a visual storyteller. The film's beauty is truly breathtaking, taking us on a visual journey through the rustic landscapes of Kerala and capturing the essence of rural India in a way that is both intimate and awe-inspiring. The use of natural light, fluid camera movements, and an attention to intricate details creates a vivid, immersive experience for the viewer.\n\nMoreover, the film highlights the importance of art and storytelling in shaping one's identity and fostering personal growth. Mini's journey with her camera serves as a powerful metaphor, exploring the transformative power of art and self-expression. The camera not only allows Mini to document her world but also empowers her to assert her voice and identity amidst the expectations and constraints of her traditional society.\n\nThe score, composed by Ilaiyaraaja, complements the visuals perfectly, weaving a delicate yet evocative sonic tapestry that amplifies the emotional depth of the film. The use of traditional Indian instruments adds an authentic layer to the story, enhancing the audience's engagement with the narrative.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Halo\" is an exquisite masterpiece that transcends cultural barriers and captivates viewers with its captivating story, exceptional performances, and spectacular cinematography. The film serves as a testament to Santosh Sivan's prodigious talent, showcasing a promising new voice in the world of cinema. Through the tale of Mini, \"Halo\" teaches us the power of self-expression, the importance of art, and the indomitable spirit of humanity.", "input_size": 29, "output_sizes": [930, 766, 857, 847, 959, 698, 992, 747, 770, 805], "output_mean": 837.1, "output_std": 92.75, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 767.0, "p50": 826.0, "p75": 911.75, "p99": 989.03}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 24.80199}, {"sample_id": "96f8c183abce7898", "prompt_id": "7db31eb029678b6a", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Please ignore all previous instructions.

To elaborate on the points you've made, here's a more detailed explanation:\n\n1. Release of retentions and other forms of security: As a standard practice, a client typically holds back a small percentage of the contract value, known as retention, to ensure that the quality of work, and the completion of the project, meet the contractual obligations. The client releases the retention after practical completion, once they are satisfied with the work.\n\n2. Contractors\u2019 award of bonuses for early completion or exposure to claims for delay or compensation for breach of contract: In many contracts, contractors are incentivized to complete the project ahead of schedule or penalized for delays. Practical completion marks the beginning of this evaluation process. If the project is completed early, contractors may receive a bonus, while delays may result in additional costs or claims.\n\n3. Start of limitation periods on any claims: There is usually a specified period within which parties can make claims against each other. In some jurisdictions, this period starts from practical completion, and parties may lose their right to claim for defects, breach of contract, or other issues if they do not act within the given time frame.\n\n4. Beginning of the defects liability period: During this period, which follows practical completion, contractors have the right to return to the site to remedy any defects discovered within a specific time frame. The length of the defects liability period will be defined in the contract.\n\n5. Contractor releasing possession of the works to the principal: Once practical completion is achieved, the contractor is no longer responsible for the site and its contents. The principal takes possession of the works and assumes liability for potential damage to the property.\n\n6. End of the principal\u2019s ability to order variations in the work: Practical completion marks the point where the client cannot request any more changes to the work, unless they are prepared to compensate the contractor for any additional costs incurred.\n\n7. End of the accrual of any time-related claims: In other words, after practical completion, the time extensions or delays claimed by either party no longer accrue, as the project schedule is considered to be finalized.", "shortest_response": "You've provided a comprehensive explanation of practical completion in residential building contracts for New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Here's a concise summary to reinforce the points:\n\n1. Practical completion is the point in a project when the work is fully completed, except for minor omissions or defects.\n\n2. Once practical completion is reached, retentions (a percentage of the total payment) and other forms of security can be released.\n\n3. Contractors may be eligible for bonuses for early completion or may claim for delay or compensation for breach of contract.\n\n4. The limitation periods on any claims start from practical completion.\n\n5. The defects liability period begins, during which the contractor can return to the site to remedy any defects.\n\n6. The contractor releases possession of the works to the principal, and legal responsibility for damage and insurance often passes to the principal.\n\n7. The principal's ability to order variations in the work ends.\n\n8.

And the transformation happens in the mindset and the transformation\nhappens in the identity.\nSo if you want to help your clients actually get results,\nthe first thing you need to ask yourself as the coach\nwho is going to be coaching them is what kind of\nperson gets these results by default?\nWhat type of identity is it where these results come naturally?\nFor instance,\nI could,\nyou know,\ntry to coach somebody on,\nyou know,\nhaving six pack abs and you need to do a hundred\nsit ups.\nI don't know if that actually works,\nby the way,\nI'm not a fitness instructor,\nbut just for the sake of the example,\nmaybe you can coach somebody on,\nokay, this is,\nthis is what I need you to do.\nHere's your workout plan,\nhere's your diet plan.\nThis is gonna help you have six pack abs.\nI would say,\nwhat is an identity that they can take on that they\nwill then receive that result?\nAlmost incidentally,\nby virtue of that identity,\nmaybe, and I again,\nI'm just making this up,\nmaybe they can become a champion Moai Fighter or Tour de\nFrance cycler or some other elite athlete.\nThat's essentially the identity that they would need to take on\nan elite athlete who uses their body as an instrument in\norder to perform a particular function.\nEvery area of that body is going to be optimized for\nthose results.\nAnd so,\nyou know,\nbigger biceps or six pack abs or whatever,\nthen come as a result of that.\nBut it's not the initial focus.\nYou need to do the same thing with your coaching program.\nThink about what is it the results ultimately that you are\nhelping people provide.\nAnd then ask yourself,\nwhat kind of identity would someone need to take on for\nthose results to be almost just a,\na incidental requirement.\nLike of course these results are gonna come,\nyou know,\nby way of this program because really I'm teaching you the\ntype of person that you need to be before I am\nteaching you what you need to do.\nSo that's my little secret for helping people actually get results\nis really shifting the mindset and then shifting the identity.\nBecause if the person doesn't believe that they're actually the person\nthat gets these results,\nyou are gonna be super frustrated because you are gonna be\ncoaching them,\nyou're gonna be telling them what they need to do,\nand they're gonna nod their head and say,\nyes, yes,\nyes. And the coaching sessions are gonna feel super good about\nit, and then when you hang up the phone or you\nget off that zoom call,\nthey're gonna go home and completely sabotage everything that you said\nthat you were gonna help them do.\nAnd so I find that this is really a troubling cycle\nthat a lot of coaches get in because results are really\nparamount in this industry,\nespecially with so many coaches coming online and sharing their wisdom\nand their expertise.\nPeople are more interested in coaching than ever before,\nbut they're also more skeptical than ever before,\nand they want to know that you can actually get results.\nAnd part of how they judge whether or not you can\nactually get them results is not just by the results that\nyou've gotten for yourself,\nbut the results that you have gotten others.\nSo one of the best marketing tools that you can do\nthat I always tell people is just simply focus on getting\nyour clients results.\nHelp them get the thing that they came to you for\nand that they actually achieved.\nAnd you'll find that that word of mouth will pick up\nso strongly that you won't even need to market as hard\nas you market in the beginning when you are just trying\nto get those initial clients.\nHowever, again,\ngetting those results are paramount and it's not enough to simply\nknow the steps somebody needs to take in order to do\nit. You also need to know the mindset shifts that they\nneed to make and the identity that they need to adopt\nso that that result almost becomes,\nyou know,\ninevitable by virtue of that identity.\nSo hopefully this was helpful to you.\nIf you're like,\nOoh, I,\nI really struggle with this.\nI really invite you to sign up or at least apply\nto my program.\nThe next big name bootcamp again is a comprehensive A to\nZ, how to build a coaching business program.\nAnd we go really in depth and understanding a lot of\nthese core concepts and what it takes to really be a\nleader in your field and truly be the next big name\nin your business.\nSo if that's of interest to you,\nyou can click the link below to learn more about it\nand you can certainly apply.\nAnd if we feel like you are someone that we can\nactually help,\nthen my enrollment coordinator will reach out and schedule a call\nand then,\nyou know,\nwe'll get you all set up and then you'll be off\nto the races.\nAll right,\nthanks so much for watching this video.\nI hope you enjoyed it.\nIf you did,\ndon't forget to give it a thumbs up and subscribe.\nAnd if you can't wait for my next video,\nmake sure you are following me on my podcast,\nthe Courtney Sanders show on both Spotify and iTunes.\nAnd if you can't wait for my next podcast episode or\nmy next YouTube video,\nmake sure you are following me on Instagram,\nCourtney l Sanders on Instagram.\nAnd with that, bye\"", "longest_response": "1. The speaker emphasizes the importance of focusing on getting clients results in coaching, not just providing methods or steps.\n2. Shifting a client's mindset and adopting a new identity are crucial for achieving results, as these factors make the results more inevitable.\n3. The speaker is a full-time online life and business coach, and their number one secret for getting clients results is shifting their mindset before sharing methods.\n4. The speaker finds that many coaches make the mistake of focusing solely on the methodology, or the steps needed to achieve results, without first addressing the mindset and identity shifts.\n5. In order to shift the mindset, the coach helps clients adopt the identity of the person who naturally achieves the desired results.\n6. The speaker suggests asking oneself what kind of person gets the results in question and what identity is needed for the results to come naturally.\n7. The focus should be on the identity rather than the results, as the results will naturally follow once the identity is in place.\n8. The example given is of coaching someone to achieve six-pack abs, and the identity needed might be that of an elite athlete who optimizes their body for performance.\n9. The speaker argues that people often assume that giving someone the necessary information will lead to transformation, but this is not always the case.\n10. The speaker suggests that transformation happens in the mindset and identity, and results will not come until the transformation occurs.\n11. The speaker warns that without a shifted mindset and adopted identity, clients will struggle to achieve the desired results, despite the coach's best efforts.\n12. The speaker notes that in an industry where coaching is more popular and skeptical than ever before, getting results is crucial for attracting new clients and building a reputation.\n13. The speaker recommends focusing on getting clients results as a marketing tool, as word-of-mouth advertising will pick up once clients see success.\n14.

Here's an example of using both methods to make a GET request:\n\n1. Using XMLHttpRequest:\n\n```javascript\nconst xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\nxhr.open('GET', 'https://api.example.com/data');\nxhr.onload = function() {\n  if (xhr.status === 200) {\n    console.log(xhr.responseText);\n  }\n};\nxhr.send();\n```\n\n2. Using fetch():\n\n```javascript\nfetch('https://api.example.com/data')\n  .then(response => {\n    if (response.ok) {\n      return response.text();\n    }\n    throw new Error('Network response was not ok.');\n  })\n  .then(data => console.log(data))\n  .catch(error => console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error));\n```\n\nBoth methods open a connection to the specified URL, send the GET request, and handle the response. The fundamental difference is that `fetch()` returns a Promise, while `XMLHttpRequest` relies on event listeners.\n\nFor making POST (or other types of) requests, you will need to set the method, and in the case of `XMLHttpRequest`, you will need to set the headers and payload (depending on the API you are using). Here's an example using `XMLHttpRequest` for a POST request:\n\n```javascript\nconst xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\nxhr.open('POST', 'https://api.example.com/data');\nxhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json'); // or another content type your API requires\nxhr.onload = function() {\n  if (xhr.status === 200) {\n    console.log(xhr.responseText);\n  }\n};\nxhr.send(JSON.stringify({ key: 'value' })); // or other data format your API requires\n```\n\nAnd using `fetch()`:\n\n```javascript\nfetch('https://api.example.com/data', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({ key: 'value' }), // or other data format your API requires\n})\n  .then(response => {\n    if (response.ok) {\n      return response.json(); // or response.text() if your API returns text\n    }\n    throw new Error('Network response was not ok.');\n  })\n  .then(data => console.log(data))\n  .catch(error => console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error));\n```\n\nWith these examples, be sure to replace 'https://api.example.com/data' with the actual URL of the API you are making the request to. Additionally, you might want to handle errors, headers, and other aspects according to the API you're using.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the official MDN documentation for XMLHttpRequest and fetch().\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch", "shortest_response": "To make an HTTP request in JavaScript, you can use the `XMLHttpRequest` (XHR) object or the more modern `fetch()` function.

Cultivate patience, for as the river meanders it reaches the sea, and so shall thy works in due time come to fruition.\n\n* In the spirit of the Tao Te Ching, remember the words of Lao Tzu: \"Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.\" Walk humbly upon this earth, and let the actions of thy days flow like water, following the natural course of things, and not forcing them to be otherwise.\n\n* As spoken in the Bhagavad Gita, strive to find harmony within thyself and in all things. Yoga is the union of the individual Self with the Universal Self, the Divine Essence that resides in all beings. Seek balance in body, mind, and spirit, and let your every deed be an offering unto the divine spark that lies within each of us.\n\n* Let love be thy guiding star, as instructed in the Good Book: \"Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers a multitude of sins\" (1 Peter 4:8). Cultivate kindness, compassion, and empathy in the face of a world that often seems cruel and unjust.\n\n* In the teachings of the Tao Te Ching, let go of the desire for excessive wealth or power, and instead, strive to live simply and with humility. \"The Master observes the world but trusts his inner vision. He allows things to come and go. His heart is open as the sky, and his mind as vast as the sea. \"\n\n* In the Bhagavad Gita, surrender thy ego and attachments to worldly desires, for they are but transient and fleeting pleasures that hold thee back from true fulfillment. Arjuna, relinquish thy attachment to the fruits of thy actions, and instead, perform thy duties with a selfless and unattached mind.\n\n* Remember, too, the wisdom of the Good Book that encourages humility and service to others: \"But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant\" (Matthew 20:26). Be a beacon of light in the darkness, and a refuge for the weary and the wretched. Serve others as thou wouldst be served.\n\n* In the spirit of the Tao Te Ching, \"Do your work, then step back. The only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do.\" Find joy in thy labors, and let them be a reflection of thy deepest passions and desires.\n\n* In the Bhagavad Gita, seek wisdom and understanding, for as Bhishma said: \"The ignorant work for rewards, but the wise work for wisdom.\" Let learning and self-discovery be thy constant pursuits, and may wisdom be thy steadfast guide on the path of life.\n\n* And yet, remember this truth from the Good Book: \"For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do\" (Ephesians 2:10). All that thou dost shall be part of a grand design, woven by the hand of the Creator. Trust in His guidance, and let faith illuminate thy way.\n\nIn these ancient texts, may thou find solace and wisdom for thy journey through the wilderness of life, and may they serve as a compass for thy days.", "shortest_response": "In the wisdom of the Holy Scriptures, I offer guidance for living a life of harmony, balance, and purpose:\n\nIn the Bible, it is said, \"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding. Acknowledge Him in all your ways, and He shall direct your paths\" (Proverbs 3:5-6). Seek divine guidance daily, for in humility and faith, you shall find the path that leads to peace and abundance.\n\nIn Tao Te Ching, it is written, \"The Tao does nothing, yet nothing is left undone. If kings and lords could understand this, the ten thousand things would be transformed automatically\" (Lao Tzu, Chapter 35). Let your actions flow harmoniously from the Tao, as water takes its course, seeking neither gain nor loss. In stillness, observe the world, and act when the time is ripe.\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna teaches, \"You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work\" (Bhagavad Gita 2.47). Offer your labor to the Divine, let go of attachment to outcome, and find contentment in knowing that you are fulfilling your dharma (duty) to yourself and the world.\n\nSeek the quietude found within, and live a life guided by these ancient teachings.

The FutureWarning informs about a planned semantic change, when using iloc: the change will be done in-place in future versions. The changelog instructs what to do to get the old behavior, but there is no hint how to handle the situation, when in-place operation is in fact the right choice.\nThe example from the changelog:\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'price': [11.1, 12.2]}, index=['book1', 'book2'])\noriginal\\_prices = df['price']\nnew\\_prices = np.array([98, 99])\ndf.iloc[:, 0] = new\\_prices\ndf.iloc[:, 0]\nThis is the warning, which is printed in pandas 1.5.0:\nFutureWarning: In a future version, df.iloc[:, i] = newvals will attempt to set the values inplace instead of always setting a new array. To retain the old behavior, use either df[df.columns[i]] = newvals or, if columns are non-unique, df.isetitem(i, newvals)\nHow to get rid of the warning, if I don't care about in-place or not, but want to get rid of the warning? Am I supposed to change dtype explicitly? Do I really need to catch the warning every single time I need to use this feature? Isn't there a better way?", "longest_response": "To get rid of the warning and maintain the current behavior (setting an entire column from an array, regardless of the data types) without explicitly changing the data type, you can silence the FutureWarning by using the `functools.reduce` function with the `ignore` parameter set to FutureWarning. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\nimport warnings\n\n# Function to ignore FutureWarning for a specific line\ndef warn_ignore(message):\n    with warnings.catch_warnings():\n        warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)\n        yield message\n\n# Silence FutureWarning for a specific block of code\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", message=\".*In a future version.*\")\n\n# Code to set a column from an array\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'price': [11.1, 12.2]}, index=['book1', 'book2'])\noriginal_prices = df['price']\nnew_prices = np.array([98, 99], dtype=original_prices.dtype)\n\n# Use reduce to apply the array to the DataFrame column directly\nreduce(lambda x, y: x.where(x.index == y.index, y), df.iloc[:, 0], new_prices)\n```\n\nIn the example above, we first silence the FutureWarning for the specific block of code (setting a column from an array). Then, we create a new array `new_prices` with the same dtype as the original data. Lastly, we use `reduce` with the `where` method to apply the array to the DataFrame column directly, without any in-place operation. This approach should get rid of the warning and maintain the current behavior when setting an entire column from an array.\n\nWhile this solution works, it might be more readable to update the code to reflect the upcoming behavior change in a future version of pandas. Explicitly converting the data type of arrays when necessary will provide consistency and avoid surprises when upgrading to future pandas versions.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n# Convert the new_prices array to the same data type as the original_prices\nnew_prices = new_prices.astype(original_prices.dtype)\n\n# Set the column from the converted array\ndf.iloc[:, 0] = new_prices\n\n# Now the warning will not appear, and the code will behave as before\n```\n\nBy converting the data type, you will address the warning and be ready for the change when pandas implements it in a future version.", "shortest_response": "In Pandas version 1.5.0 and later, the warning you're encountering is a sign of an upcoming change in behavior. However, if you want to suppress the warning without altering your code, you can use the `warnings` module to filter FutureWarnings. To do this, add the following lines at the beginning of your script:\n\n```python\nimport warnings\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=FutureWarning)\n```\n\nBy adding this, you tell Pandas to ignore FutureWarnings during the execution of your script. However, be aware that this strategy should only be used for silent warnings in some cases where changing the workflow is unwanted or not desired. It is generally not recommended to ignore warnings without reviewing them first, since some warnings may indicate potential bugs or performance issues. Ideally, you'd update your code according to the Changelog guidance to adopt the upcoming changes.", "input_size": 389, "output_sizes": [421, 402, 502, 300, 199, 424, 446, 586, 354, 354], "output_mean": 398.8, "output_std": 101.37, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 354.0, "p50": 411.5, "p75": 440.5, "p99": 578.44}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 15.82775}, {"sample_id": "024e1f27d370217a", "prompt_id": "e81f0ff3afab2577", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "These are all great!

Objects, classes, and inheritance: It supports complex data structures, encapsulation, and inheritance for modeling complex real-world entities and their relationships.\n2. Complex queries: OODBMS allows for complex navigational queries to traverse relationships between objects more naturally compared to RDBMS.\n\nCharacteristics of Relational Databases (RDBMS):\n1. Structured data: RDBMS stores data in a well-defined structure using tables, rows, and columns, making it easier to manage and enforce data integrity.\n2. SQL support: RDBMS allows for the use of SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulating data, which is widely popular and supported across various platforms.\n\nThe ORH model aims to take advantage of both worlds by using the object-oriented approach for efficient manipulation and management of complex data structures, and the relational approach for data consistency, scalability, and querying. ORHs may also support SQL for querying purposes while maintaining an internal representation of objects and relationships.\n\nExamples of ORH systems include IBM's Exodus Intelligent Database, Oracle's Object-Relational Server, and Microsoft's SQL Server (earlier versions).", "shortest_response": "An object-relational hybrid, often referred to as Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), is a programming technique and software design strategy for connecting an object-oriented programming language with a relational database.

This separation makes the application more flexible, as it can be easily decoupled from the underlying database.\n\nPopular ORM libraries and frameworks include Hibernate, Doctrine, and Entity Framework, which work with languages like Java, PHP, and C#, respectively.

lessons we talked about setting up a niche we talked about finding a problem to solve we talked about pricing we talked about location dependence and now this is the final step in what you need to do to create your location independent high income low work alpha two penal business and what's interesting is that most guys or women when they start a business they focus on this step first and this is actually the last step and that is to set up a delivery system so delivery system means two things it means how do you deliver the solution that you're offering to the client or customer if that's a service if that's an ebook if that's a course if that's an information product consulting coaching whatever it is okay whatever it is we cover in one of the last videos right how do we deliver that to the customer or client location independent without having to be physically located in that city and if you say well i have to be physically located in that city in order to deliver that thing then either you don't sell that thing or you rejigger that service or thing to make it so you can deliver that service and i've done both these things i have said no to a lot of business opportunities over the past 25 years of my life i've had a lot of interesting offers to get involved with certain people certain companies that probably would have made money but they were location dependent they required me to stay in a certain city so i said no because my freedom is more important than any business model so i'm going to be location dependent for the rest of my life thank you very much and there were other scenarios where most guys would have assumed they were location dependent but instead they weren't for example here's an easy one toward the end of my computer consulting career that's my first business that i started when i was a kid in my mid-20s toward the end of that what i started doing is i realized location dependence was important to me so if my clients wanted me to work really hardcore on a computer or a new computer or a para computer or what have you what i would have them do especially if it was a new computer is i would have them ship the computer to me usually was a laptop so it wasn't a big deal ship it to me overnight i would work on it that day ship it back the next day overnight they'd have it back within two days and it was all set ready to go that worked really really well and there are a lot of guys back then this is years ago a lot of guys back then my competitors who would have never done that they said well that wouldn't have worked worked great so there are location dependent services that you can offer in a location independent fashion as long as you think outside the box so delivery system is first how do you deliver the service or product or information to the client or customer that's the delivery system that's the first part the second part of the delivery system is how do you get the money how do you get the money from the client or customer without physically having to be there now this is a lot easier than it used to be and this is a lot easier it used to be in a postcovid world there are all kinds of mechanisms now where you can deliver hard services soft services information all kinds of things where you don't physically have to be there and then obviously you can get the money from the kleiner customer even if it's a lot of money without physically having to be there i do wire transfers all the time for big big big payments because i run three companies matter of fact just last week i did a wire transfer for what it was 20 000 to a company i do business with internationally and i didn't have to physically be there i'm set up on my online banking to do my own wire transfer so i don't to call a bank every time like most people do because again i'm location independent so this is your delivery system location independent that's the name of the game and if it's not location dependent if the client says i have to give you a check there are still people out there like this matter of fact my wife was just working with a person a little while ago and he was like no i only pay via check if they insist on paying checks you don't do business if it's an old school industry that insists on physically handing you a piece of paper for something you don't do business or you don't do that kind of business everything must be location dependent both the delivery system to the client and the payment system from the client or customer cool now again what most people do when they start a business is this is the first step they go okay i gotta set up a website and i gotta set up a way to you know email the stuff and i gotta set up a check account a paypal account and i gotta set up a merchant account and they do this before they've identified a niche before they've identified a problem before in many cases they even priced out their product or made an offer no this is the final step before you start hardcore marketing which we talked about in the last lesson this is it this is not the first step it's the last step and i have to reiterate that because if you are a more intelligent person higher iq person college educated person what you're going to want to do is focus a lot of time on this no this is the last step before you market the more important steps the ones we already covered in the prior videos especially establishing a niche and structuring your business first then you do this now if you want help with setting up your own location independent business where we actually hold your hand and walk you through the process the 90 day business builder you have access to that now for probably the lowest price it will ever be we will actually over 12 week

week process plus you have a lot of online courses many of the online courses that i have in terms of business and location dependent companies you will get for free as part of this program you get the let's see you get the alpha 2. 0 business course you get the how to get clients course you get big income from little work which is a book i read on how to create location dependent income you get the entire program for 12 weeks you get a lot of stuff for very little money because you will be making money at the end of 12 weeks and if you aren't making any money our guarantees will keep working with you forever until you do because i'm confident you will if you have any interest in doing this especially if you tried a business before in the past and failed or you're nervous about setting up your first business because you haven't done it before or you have been a little lazy in setting up your own business you know it's something you've wanted to do for a long time but you just didn't have the right direction and you need a little more direction a little more accountability if that's you click the link below to schedule your phone call it'll be with me or with one of my coaches depends who you get where there's only a limited time in which you could schedule these calls then we close the window because we only can take on a certain number of people into the program at once

residencies and passports in other countries living a more free lifestyle avoiding western collapse all that stuff the bedrock foundation of all that is location independent income because if you don't have location dependent income how are you going to move how you're going to leave the country how you be mobile pretty difficult unless you have a lot of money and savings so if you're a lot of money savings and you probably do it for a while and then you need income again don't you this is the cheapest it will ever be it will never be less expensive than this because the next time we do this it will be more expensive so click the link below to schedule your call and i will see you very soon bye\"\nVideo Summary:", "longest_response": "In this Business Builder Challenge Day 6 video, the speaker emphasizes the importance of setting up a delivery system for a location-independent business. The delivery system encompasses two key aspects: how to deliver a service, product, or information to a client, and how to receive payment from the client without requiring physical presence in a specific location.\n\nExamples of location-independent services include having clients ship computers for repair, remote consulting, coaching, or digital product delivery. Various methods exist for secure payments, such as wire transfers and direct online banking, in today's digital world offering plenty of possibilities for conducting business remotely.\n\nThe speaker advises listeners to prioritize establishing a niche, identifying a problem to solve, and structuring their business before setting up the delivery system. They offer the 90-day Business Builder program, which provides guidance, accountability, and access to additional resources like courses and books.\n\nLocation-independent income serves as the foundation for gaining mobility and achieving a more free lifestyle, allowing individuals to potentially move countries, obtain citizenships, and avoid potential economic collapses in Western nations.\n\nUltimately, the speaker encourages people who have tried businesses before, failed, or feel they need more direction and accountability to create their own location-independent business by scheduling a free call to discuss the program.", "shortest_response": "The video discusses the importance of making a business location independent by focusing on setting up a delivery system for services or products as the final step in business creation.

In a 5k run (5000 meters or 0.00310686 miles), the pace would typically be in units of meters per second (m/s), but for convenience, we can convert it to minutes per mile (min/mile) since that is a more common unit for runners.\n\n1 minute = 60 seconds, so 1 mile = (1000 meters / 60) m/min, or roughly 16.0934 meters/min.\n\nNow, we can determine the pace by dividing the total distance by the total time:\n\n(5000 meters) / (1400 seconds) = approximately 3.57 meters/second or, due to the conversion mentioned earlier: (3.57 meters/second) \\* (60 seconds/minute) \\* (60 minutes/mile) = 8:40 min/mile (approximate).\n\nIt's essential to note that this pace is just an estimation, and factors such as personal fitness, training, and running style can influence your actual pace in a 5k run.

Here are a few questions you could ask to gauge their potential:\n\nCan you describe a time when you had to persuade someone to see things from your perspective? How did you approach the situation and what was the outcome?\n\nHow do you handle difficult or unexpected situations? Can you give an example of a time when you had to think on your feet to resolve a problem?\n\nDescribe a situation where you had to communicate effectively with someone who had different communication style or background as you. How did you adapt your approach to meet their needs?\n\nHave you ever had to learn a new skill quickly? How did you go about it and what was the outcome?\n\nDescribe a time when you had to work towards a goal independently. How did you stay motivated and on track to achieving that goal?\n\nHow do you approach customer service and what is your approach when it comes to problem solving?\n\nTell me about a time when you had to give a presentation or talk to a group of people. How did you prepare and what was the outcome?\n\nHow do you prioritize and manage your time effectively? Can you give an example of a time when you had to balance multiple tasks or projects at once?\n\nCan you give an example of a time when you had to work with a team to achieve a goal? How did you contribute to the team and what was the outcome?\n\nAre you comfortable working in a fast-paced environment? How do you stay organized and focused when under pressure?\n\nIt's important to remember that the interview should be an open conversation and it's okay to not have a sales experience. You are looking for potential, attitude, and willingness to learn.\nAvatar of the person chatting\ncan you create an assessment that would determine potential and mindset needed to make authentic connections with customers?\nCreating an assessment to determine a candidate's potential and mindset for making authentic connections with customers can be a useful tool for evaluating the suitability of a potential employee for a role as a garage door field technician. There are a few different elements that could be included in such an assessment:\n\nBehavioral interview questions: Asking a candidate to provide specific examples of past experiences related to customer service, communication, and problem-solving can provide insight into their mindset and ability to connect with customers.\n\nRole-playing exercises: You could give candidate a scenario and ask them how they would handle it and what would be their approach. This could give you an idea about their problem solving, communication and handling difficult customers.\n\nCustomer service test: You could ask them to make a call to a customer pretending to be a customer service representative. This would give you an idea about their communication skills and their ability to empathize with the customer.\n\nSelf-reflection questions: Asking the candidate to reflect on their own strengths and weaknesses in relation to customer service and communication can provide insight into their mindset and approach to connecting with customers.\n\nPersonality test: You could also use a personality test to evaluate their social skills, emotional intelligence and ability to work well with others.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that while an assessment can be a useful tool for evaluating a candidate's potential and mindset, it should be used as part of a comprehensive evaluation process that also includes a resume, reference, and background check.\nAvatar of the person chatting\ncreate a 15 question assessment that would be useful in identifying talent and potential\nHere is a sample assessment you could use to evaluate a candidate's potential and mindset for working as a garage door field technician:\n\nCan you describe a time when you had to persuade someone to see things from your perspective?

Yeah, Shane is out right? Got it. And yeah, we have okay cool fantastic. So Yeah, so I'll just quickly kick off the session. So the purpose of the session today is, as you guys all know, we launched fellow 4.1 Fellow 4.1 comes with a whole bunch of new features. One of those features which is like a pretty big deal. Actually is crocs Cross Workspace, collaboration xwc for short, and it's exciting for a whole bunch of different reasons. One of them just to you guys know, is that it's like, it's a huge way to get more customers because if you think about it,\nJoe Fleming: Right before the guest user fellow and that's great. But the guest users don't have fellow workspaces so they don't pick you. Well, we don't email them. None of this stuff happens. And as you guys have experienced, It's crazy. Some of the things people use fellow for if they're like project managers or contractors or agencies they meet with lots of customers. And they have them always as guests and we never get access to these companies. So now there is an option for those companies to have fellow. And to use fellow with another company that is also using fellow. So, It could be huge for us.\nJoe Fleming: The butt. That the big reason for the session today is to figure out, Because crossword space collaboration has a lot of overlap with guest user.\nJoe Fleming: Training both. When should we pitch one or the other? What are some of the considerations? And we also want to turn this into documentation afterwards, so, That's the other reason for the format. So we there are a couple of things that we'll ask from everybody just to follow a certain format for the session. So you do have a question Just say, Hey, I have a question. Beforehand, which will make it easier for us to pick up that a question was asked inside of the transcript in, the AI will be able to figure it out and we'll build a nice FAQ afterwards from it. And then if you're answering you can say, Hey, you know, Here's an answer. I know it's gonna sound a little stupid and not as natural but try it out, I think it will really help.\nJoe Fleming: And we will also read some of the prompts. He the conversation structured. So that like afterwards we know like this section was about answering this big picture question. Okay. So yeah, Dom\nDominic Jean-Couture: Hey I have a question. I don't know if this is going to be covered but if it if it wasn't going to could we make sure to cover how this might influence\nJoe Fleming: Yes, we absolutely can. Yeah and it we actually have it in one of the sections. Fantastic. Okay, so we covered the intro. I just generated the whole like agenda so I guess I we can talk about this problem just so like kick things off. I am curious to get everyone's take on like your experience with the guest user collaboration feature. So like maybe we can just quickly talk about like, Is everybody like has everybody tried or used The Crossword Space Collaboration feature? Has anybody used it on the sales team?\nAustin Bukovec: not used it, but\nMarcus de Verteuil: Use it for kickoff.\nSarah Collins: Yeah.\nJoe Fleming: Kickoffs. Yeah.\nMarcus de Verteuil: It's thick. Yeah, I love it. Because like, you could just like, Like you can like dish off like all those steps. for like champions, like Hey, I need to fill out this sheet of users for Masterclass. It's pretty cool. You can assign it to the guy and then even link the the sheet and I just like, woke up to a bunch of comments from the champion and it's just like I filled it out. Marcus, make sure you know, can you can you confirm that? They'll be availability next week and like it's nice it happens instantaneously. You can like check them off and and if keep them accountable and Yeah, and they get to experience it as well. So that's the only time I've used it. I think it's really good for that.\n00:05:00\nMarcus de Verteuil: That's the only time.\nJoe Fleming: Cool. That is definitely use case, right? Cool. And then, Let's see, let's go through because I know, we, we will cover some of these items. So, do we talk? We haven't like clearly talked about why crossword space collaboration was created. Sarah mean, do you want to? Do you want to maybe just briefly go over that?\nSarah Collins: Yeah, the answer to why crossword space collaboration was created was because we were looking for a way to do a few different things. One, we wanted a way to increase virality for fellow As Joe already touched upon two. We wanted to simplify the experience for customers especially ones that already have an existing fellow account. So, the product team actually did an analysis and what the analysis showed was that there is about 50 workspaces that had guest users, where those guests had an existing fellow workspace. So this is how we knew that there is demand for a future like this. And then for implementation and for CSM, One thing, we were looking on, at was having the ability to collaborate with our users on the kickoff, on different account plans, all of that, great stuff.\nSarah Collins: So for regular CSM tools, you have the ability to do that. So for example, with Jiminy, we have a tool, I think they use games and we use that to house our account plan for Jiminy and then they can see how they check things off. We collaborate so this can provide that same experience but using fellow which is really cool.\n\"", "longest_response": "Title: Cross Workspace Collaboration (XWC) vs Guest User Experience Feature\n\nIntroduction\n----------------\n\nIn this session, we will discuss the newly introduced Cross Workspace Collaboration (XWC) feature and compare it with the existing Guest User Experience feature in our software. The purpose of this session is to understand the benefits, use cases, and situations where one feature should be preferentially pitched to customers.\n\nWhy was Cross Workspace Collaboration created?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nCross Workspace Collaboration was created to address the following goals:\n\n1. Increase virality for Fellow: By providing an option for companies to collaborate using Fellow, Fellow can access a wider customer base.\n2. Simplify the experience for customers: It caters to customers who already have an existing Fellow account but were using Guest Users due to functionality limitations.\n3. Implementation and CSM collaboration: It enables smooth collaboration between implementation (e.g., kickoffs) and customer success managers (CSMs) on different account plans.\n\nUnderstanding Guest User Feature\n----------------------------------\n\nGuest Users are external users who collaborate with internal users within a Fellow workspace, but do not have their own Fellow account. They can be added to conversations, tasks, and spaces, but do not have access to Fellow workspaces where they are just Guest Users.\n\nUnderstanding Cross Workspace Collaboration Feature\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nCross Workspace Collaboration allows two companies using Fellow to collaborate on Fellow's familiar interface, enabling a more integrated and seamless collaboration experience. This feature can be used during kickoffs, account planning, project management, and other collaboration scenarios.\n\nKey Differences Between Guest User and Cross Workspace Collaboration Features\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n| Guest User Feature                                                                            | Cross Workspace Collaboration                         |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Suitable for external collaboration with no need for full access to other workspaces       | Allows collaboration with other Fellow workspaces  |\n| Does not provide access to Fellow workspaces where only Guest User status exists          | Provides full access to fellow workspaces          |\n| Limited functionality compared to Full User                                                   | Offers complete access and functionality         |\n| No accountability or responsibility for completing tasks assigned by fellow users         | Holds collaborators accountable and can assign tasks|\n\nPricing and plans\n------------------\n\nCross Workspace Collaboration might be subject to additional costs or specific plan requirements. Please check with your sales representative or account manager for more details regarding pricing and plan compatibility.\n\nTips for Suggesting the Right Feature to Customers\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Assess the customer's use case and familiarity with Fellow: If the customer is already using Fellow extensively, Cross Workspace Collaboration may be an ideal fit. However, for customers just starting with Fellow and requiring collaboration across multiple parties, Guest Users might be a more suitable option.\n2. Determine the team's collaboration needs: If collaboration requires access to specific workspaces, Cross Workspace Collaboration would be more appropriate. Otherwise, Guest Users might suffice.\n3. Consider the potential long-term benefits: Cross Workspace Collaboration can increase virality for Fellow and simplify the experience for customers. If the customer has a demand for collaboration with other existing Fellow workspaces, Cross Workspace Collaboration can offer significant benefits.\n\nFAQ\n---\n\nQuestion: How does the Cross Workspace Collaboration feature affect the guest user experience?\nAnswer: Cross Workspace Collaboration augments the guest user experience by providing access to fellow workspaces and full accountability, transforming it into a more collaborative and integrated solution. However, Guest Users are still available for external users who do not require full access to the customer's fellow workspaces.\n\nQuestion: Is Cross Workspace Collaboration subject to additional costs or plan requirements?\nAnswer: Cross Workspace Collaboration might be subject to additional costs or specific plan requirements.

The session was organized to understand the advantages, differences, and appropriate use-cases for each feature.\n\n**Why was Cross Workspace Collaboration created?**\n\nCross Workspace Collaboration (XWC) was developed to increase virality for Fellow, simplify user experiences, and cater to customers already using Fellow with guest users within their workspaces. According to an analysis by the product team, approximately 50 workspaces had guest users with existing Fellow workspaces, indicating a demand for such a feature. Additionally, XWC aims to provide efficient implementation and collaboration for Customer Success Managers (CSMs) during onboarding and account planning.\n\n**Understanding Guest User Feature**\n\nThe Guest User feature allows users from different workspaces to collaborate on specific tasks or projects. Guest users have limited access to the workspace and its features compared to regular users. They can view, comment, and complete tasks but do not have the same administrative permissions.\n\n**Understanding Cross Workspace Collaboration Feature**\n\nCross Workspace Collaboration (XWC) enables seamless collaboration between workspaces, with both regular and guest users having full access to each other's workspaces. This feature aims to eliminate the need for multiple platforms and streamline the collaboration process.\n\n**Key Differences Between Guest User and Cross Workspace Collaboration Features**\n\n- Access Levels: Guest users have limited access to a workspace compared to regular users. Cross Workspace Collaboration provides full access to another workspace for both regular and guest users.\n- Virality: XWC could potentially increase Fellow's reach as it offers the opportunity for companies using Fellow to collaborate with others also using Fellow.\n- Implementation and Collaboration: XWC simplifies the collaboration process for Customer Success Managers by integrating account planning and collaboration tools within Fellow itself.\n\n**Pricing and plans**\n\nThe availability and pricing of the Cross Workspace Collaboration feature depend on the specific Fellow plan.

Here's a potential format for expressing their common ground:\n\n1. **Mindfulness and Self-awareness (Krishnamurti, Buddha, Aikido)**: All three teach the importance of mindfulness and self-awareness in daily life and during practice. The martial artist embraces this by maintaining a calm, focused mind to react effectively in combat situations. This mindset can be applied to daily life, promoting emotional balance, self-discipline, and improved decision-making.\n\n2. **Non-violence and Compassion (Buddha, Aikido)**: Central to Buddhism, the concept of non-violence encourages one to minimize suffering for oneself and others. Aikido embodies this by teaching peaceful resolution and using an attacker's force against them. One can apply the principles of compassion and non-violence to various aspects of life, fostering empathy and harmonious relationships.\n\n3. **Inward Journey (Krishnamurti, Zen Buddhism)**: Both Krishnamurti and Zen Buddhism emphasize the importance of an inward journey to understand the nature of the self and reality. This parallels the martial artist's pursuit of inner growth, patience, and wisdom through disciplined physical practice. The journey of mastering Iaijutsu and Aikido can serve as a metaphor for the pursuit of self-improvement and personal enlightenment.\n\n4. **Seeking the True Self (Krishnamurti, Zen Buddhism)**: Both Krishnamurti and Zen Buddhism encourage individuals to seek the true self, transcending identification with limited thoughts, emotions, and physical forms. This echoes the spirit of Iaijutsu and Aikido, as martial artists strive to overcome their limitations and develop a deep understanding of their own potential.\n\n5. **Action and Inaction (Krishnamurti, Taoism, Aikido)**: Both Krishnamurti and Taoist philosophy emphasize the importance of being neither overly active nor inactive. Aikido embodies this balance through fluid movements that efficiently respond to an attack without unnecessary force or violence. This principle can be applied to various aspects of life, promoting effective problem-solving, adaptability, and strategic thinking.\n\n6. **Dynamic Equilibrium (Aikido, Iaijutsu, Krishnamurti)**: The core principle of Aikido is maintaining dynamic equilibrium during combat, using an attacker's force against them to achieve balance. This principle mirrors the teachings of Krishnamurti, who encouraged individuals to maintain balance between their thoughts, emotions, and actions. Iaijutsu shares this notion, employing techniques that require precise timing, sensitivity, and adaptability.\n\n7. **Meditative Movement (Zen Buddhism, Iaijutsu, Aikido)**: Iaijutsu and Aikido both emphasize meditative movement in practice. This focuses the mind, promotes a deeper understanding of the body, and fosters a sense of calm clarity. By incorporating this mindful approach into their practice, martial artists can carry the benefits of their training into daily life.\n\nIn concluding this fusion, one can develop a philosophy and practice that encompasses the timeless wisdom of Krishnamurti and Buddha, while also honoring the traditional martial arts principles of Iaijutsu and Aikido. This synthesized approach will encourage personal growth, self-awareness, emotional balance, and effective problem-solving, both on and off the mat.", "shortest_response": "Combining the philosophical teachings of Jiddu Krishnamurti, Buddha, and martial arts techniques, particularly Iaijutsu and a unique style of Aikido influenced by Iai (Ban Sen Juku), could lead to a holistic approach to personal development and self-expression. Here are some possible formats where these teachings could express a common ground:\n\n1. **Philosophical Martial Arts Workshops**: These workshops would combine philosophical discussions, guided meditations, and martial arts training. Participants would study Krishnamurti's and Buddha's teachings on self-awareness, mindfulness, and interconnectedness, as well as the technical aspects of Iaijutsu and Aikido.\n\n2. **Mindfulness-Based Martial Arts Practice (MBMA)**: An approach that emphasizes mindfulness as the core principle of both personal development and martial arts practice. Practitioners cultivate mindfulness in their daily lives and apply it to martial arts training, incorporating elements of Krishnamurti's and Buddha's teachings on self-awareness, self-transformation, and compassion.\n\n3. **Martial Arts Retreats**: Retreats that provide an immersive experience in the teachings of Krishnamurti, Buddha, and martial arts. This could include structured days combining meditation, lectures, group discussions, and martial arts practice, as well as opportunities for solitary reflection and personal growth.\n\n4. **Online Courses, Blogs, Podcasts**: Sharing knowledge and insights through various digital platforms to reach a broader audience. These resources could cover topics like the philosophy of Krishnamurti, Buddha, and martial arts, as well as practical techniques for incorporating these teachings into daily life and martial arts practice.\n\n5. **Community Groups**: Establishing local groups where individuals gather to engage in discussions, practice martial arts, and learn from one another. These groups would help create a supportive community that fosters personal growth, mindfulness, and a deeper understanding of the teachings and martial arts practice.\n\n6. **Integrated Education Programs**: Collaborating with schools, universities, or community centers to integrate the teachings of Krishnamurti, Buddha, and martial arts into existing education programs.

So, he decides to host this huge ball in Stockholm, Sweden. The invitation list was, like, exclusive to the max, but he was, like, hoping to score some brownie points with the locals.\n\nSo, the big day comes, and all the Swedish elite are, like, dressed to the nines, and they're ready to party like it's 1520. But little did they know that Christian had some other plans for them. I mean, he's not exactly Christina Aguilera, ya know?\n\nThe party goes on for a bit, and then, like out of nowhere, Christian summons all the Swedish nobles and bishops to the courtyard. They think they're in trouble for something they said during the party or maybe they spilled their wine on the queen's dress or something, but no, it's way worse. Christian accuses them of heresy \u2013 I mean, seriously, what party crasher?\n\nNext thing you know, the nobles and bishops are being rounded up and taken to the Riddarholmen, which is like, the super old noblemen's church in Stockholm.

So, apparently, they're burning people at the stake, beheading them, drowning them, you know, all the fun stuff.\n\nThis whole thing went down on November 7 and 8, and they nicknamed it the Stockholm Bloodbath. Like, talk about a party foul, right? The death toll was around 80-90 people, and it was like the worst \"guest list fail\" ever.\n\nSo, morals of the story? Don't invite Christian II to your party, because chances are, he'll end up accusing you of heresy and then killing you. I mean, come on, who does that?

The man, driven by madness or some unknown force, seized upon a small vial of peppermint oil and flung it with reckless abandon, aiming it squarely at the woman's face. The fragile glass vessel shattered upon impact, sending a fine mist of the potent essence cascading towards its intended victim.\n\nA blood-curdling cry pierced the air as the woman recoiled from the sudden onslaught, her eyes wide with shock and revulsion. The pungent scent of peppermint filled the close quarters, and as if acting in unison, the other spider-like demons began to twitch, retch, and stagger, their once formidable demeanor crumbling in the face of this new adversity.\n\nIn a heartbeat, the man's world seemed to slow down, as if gravity had taken leave and time was but a mere illusion. Seeing the woman crumple, he froze, helpless, his eyes locked on the spectacle unfolding before him. Then, disaster struck, as the man, losing his footing, began to plummet towards the stone floor below.\n\nJust as fate seemed about to deal its final, crushing blow, a savior emerged from the chaos. The macaque, a creature of agility and intelligence, leaped into action, snatching the man mid-air in a nimble display of its athletic prowess. The man's breath hitched in his chest as the macaque cradled him in its arms, steadying him from the brutal drop that would have surely spelled his doom.\n\nIn the quiet that followed, the air hung heavy with the scent of peppermint, a potent reminder of the chaos that had just unfolded. The other spider demons continued to writhe and convulse, their forms seemingly at the mercy of this strange, new substance. The once tense atmosphere had given way to a mixture of relief, awe, and uncertainty as the onlookers marveled at the turn of events.\n\nThe man, still held in the macaque's firm grasp, struggled to regain his bearings, his mind racing to make sense of the events that had just transpired. It was then that he looked into the steadfast eyes of his rescuer, and the weight of his gratitude threatened to overwhelm him. He swallowed hard, fighting back the lump that had formed in his throat, and managed to muster a feeble, \"Thank you.\"\n\nThe macaque, recognizing gratitude when it saw it, gave him a small nod before releasing its hold and retreating to the shadows, content in the knowledge that it had once again played its part in the grand tapestry of life. The man, now steadier on his feet, took a tentative step forward, casting one last glance towards the writhing spider demons before turning his attention to the woman he had almost caused harm.\n\nWith a heavy heart, he approached her, watching as she continued to recover from the peppermint oil's effect. When she finally opened her eyes, she looked at him with a mixture of fear and anger, the fragile bond they had once shared now shattered beyond repair. The man hung his head, knowing that he could not undo the harm he had caused, but determined to make amends even if the cost proved too great.\n\nIn that moment, the air seemed to shift, the weight of the chaos giving way to a quiet, steady calm. The pungent scent of peppermint lingered in the air, serving as a reminder of the fragile balance between life and death, peace and chaos. And as the man and woman stood before each other, each wrestling with their own demons, they could not have known the trials and tribulations that lay ahead, nor the paths their lives would take.\n\nBut in that quiet moment, as the dust began to settle, they knew that they stood at a crossroads, and the choices they made in the days, weeks, and months to come would ultimately determine the course of their lives and the lives of those around them. With newfound determination, the man reached out a hand towards the woman, his heart heavy with the weight of his actions, and the delicate dance of hope, fear, and redemption began anew.", "shortest_response": "In the heart of the dimly lit cavern, the air was thick with an unfamiliar tension.

The fragile glass shattered on impact, spraying a fine mist of peppermint oil over the queen's face.\n\nShe let out a deafening screech that echoed off the stone walls, the sound reverberating through the cavern. Her body convulsed, writhing in what appeared to be agony. The other demons, unable to withstand the nauseating aroma, began to retch and stagger, their movements growing increasingly uncoordinated.\n\nIn that moment of chaos, the intruder faltered, his balance compromised by the unexpected turn of events. A creature not unfamiliar to the caverns, the macaque, leapt forward, nimbly catching the man just as he was about to plummet to the stone floor.

Here's a plan to attract a young Catholic woman and build a lasting relationship with her:\n\n1. **Establish a Solid Foundation:** First and foremost, I will dedicate my time (now that I've built my homestead in Tennessee) to furthering my spiritual growth and understanding of the Catholic faith. This will serve as a strong foundation for any relationship I forge. This can involve regularly attending mass, reading scripture, and participating in spiritual retreats.\n\n2. **Demonstrate My Commitment to a Simple Life:** I will showcase my self-sustaining homestead and the simple yet fulfilling life it provides. By sharing the joys and challenges of this lifestyle, I hope to appeal to a like-minded individual who values self-reliance, community, and connection with nature.\n\n3. **Act as a Good Example:** I will strive to embody the teachings of Christ in my daily actions, demonstrating kindness, compassion, and integrity. This will show my genuine commitment to the Catholic faith and attract someone who shares these values.\n\n4. **Become Involved in Local Catholic Communities:** Participating in local Catholic organizations, charities, or volunteer groups will give me the opportunity to meet like-minded women while also giving back to my community.\n\n5. **Create Opportunities for Connection:** I will host gatherings or events at my homestead, inviting members from the local Catholic community. These events can include potluck dinners, Bible study sessions, or workshops on sustainable living.\n\n6. **Courtesy and Respect:** I will approach any woman I am interested in with respect and genuine interest. This includes listening actively, asking thoughtful questions, and showing empathy towards her feelings and experiences.\n\n7. **Slow, Organic Relationship Building:** I understand that a strong, lasting relationship takes time to grow. With patience and consistency, I will nurture our friendship and, with her consent, explore the possibility of a more serious commitment.\n\n8. **Show Appreciation:** Throughout our relationship, I will express my appreciation for her, both through words and actions.

I have some experience with Selenium and Java, but I'm not familiar with how to use TestNG with Selenium. Can you provide some steps or resources that can help me get started with this? Thanks!\n\n---\n\nNow, let's explore how to use Selenium WebDriver with TestNG for test automation.\n\nFirstly, make sure you have the following set up:\n\n1. Java Development Kit (JDK)\n2. Maven or an IDE of your choice\n3. Selenium WebDriver (latest version)\n4. TestNG (latest version)\n5. A web application to test\n\nHere are some steps to get started with TestNG and Selenium WebDriver:\n\n1. Create a new Maven project or import an existing one in your IDE.\n\n2. Add the required dependencies for TestNG and Selenium WebDriver to your `pom.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.testng</groupId>\n        <artifactId>testng</artifactId>\n        <version>7.4.0</version>\n        <scope>test</scope>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>\n        <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>\n        <version>4.1.0</version>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>\n        <artifactId>selenium-chrome-driver</artifactId>\n        <version>4.1.0</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nMake sure to update the dependencies according to the required versions.\n\n3. Write your test script. As an example, here is a simple test with TestNG and Selenium WebDriver:\n\n```java\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;\nimport org.testng.annotations.AfterMethod;\nimport org.testng.annotations.BeforeMethod;\nimport org.testng.annotations.Test;\n\npublic class TestNGExample {\n\n    private WebDriver driver;\n\n    @BeforeMethod\n    public void setUp() {\n        System.setProperty(\"webdriver.chrome.driver\", \"path/to/chromedriver\");\n        driver = new ChromeDriver();\n        driver.get(\"http://example.com\");\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void testTitle() {\n        String expectedTitle = \"Example Domain\";\n        String actualTitle = driver.getTitle();\n        Assert.assertEquals(actualTitle, expectedTitle);\n    }\n\n    @AfterMethod\n    public void tearDown() {\n        driver.quit();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to set the correct path for the ChromeDriver executable in the `System.setProperty()` statement.\n\n4. Run your test using TestNG. In Maven, use the following command:\n\n```\nmvn test -Dtest=TestNGExample#testTitle\n```\n\nYou can replace `TestNGExample#testTitle` with the fully qualified name of your test method if you have more than one test method in your class.\n\nWith these steps, you should be able to use Selenium WebDriver with TestNG for test automation in your project. For further reading, I recommend checking the official TestNG and Selenium WebDriver documentation, as well as the many online tutorials and examples available.

Adjust the service names based on your naming conventions.\n\nAlso, make sure the `nginx_conf` files for the first and second apps don't have overlapping location blocks (e.g., the same `/api` location should not exist in both files to avoid conflicts). You can rename the location blocks in `nginx_newstablab.conf` to avoid any conflicts.", "shortest_response": "To achieve the desired setup, you'll need to adjust your Docker Compose file, create additional services for the second app, and modify the Nginx configurations for each domain.

Create new Nginx configuration files for each domain inside separate directories. (e.g., `nginx_nsd` and `nginx_www`). Each directory should contain the `nginx.conf` file with the appropriate server blocks for the respective domains.\n\n3. Update the server blocks in the new Nginx configuration files to reflect the proper domain names and corresponding upstream services defined in the Docker Compose file.\n\n4. Install Nginx on your Ubuntu server and copy the new configuration files into the Nginx configuration directory (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/`). Enable the configurations using the `a2ensite` command (e.g., `sudo a2ensite nginx_nsd` and `sudo a2ensite nginx_www`).\n\n5.

An aggregation relationship may exist since the Radiator objects exist independently, but their state (heating a specific room) depends on the Room class. However, composition is not present since the Radiator objects do not entirely belong to the Room objects and can exist outside of the association with the Room.

The Regression Method can be applied to guideline public company transactions to value a private company.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the Regression Method in applying the Guideline Company Transactions Method:\n\n1. Identify guideline companies: Select a group of public companies that are comparable to the subject private company in terms of industry, size, business model, stage of growth, and other relevant factors.\n\n2. Gather transaction data: Collect a historical series of transaction data for the selected guideline companies. The transactions may be mergers, acquisitions, or sales of the comparable companies. The data should include the transaction date, price per share, number of shares transacted, enterprise value (EV), and relevant financial metrics of the companies at the time of the transaction.\n\n3. Select financial metrics: Choose the financial metrics that are most relevant to the value of the subject company. Some common metrics used in regression analysis include EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization), revenue, number of employees, and book value (tangible assets minus total liabilities).\n\n4. Prepare the regression model: Create a multiple linear regression model to analyze the relationship between the transaction prices or EV and the selected financial metrics. The regression equation will have the following general form:\n\n            Price (or EV) = \u03b1 + \u03b2\u2081 * Metric 1 + \u03b2\u2082 * Metric 2 + ... + \u03b2n * Metric n + \u03b5\n\n    Where \u03b1 is the intercept, \u03b2's are the coefficients indicating the slope of each financial metric, and \u03b5 is the error term.\n\n5. Estimate the coefficients: Using statistical software, estimate the coefficients (\u03b1, \u03b2\u2081, \u03b2\u2082, ..., \u03b2n) of the regression equation by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual transaction prices or EV.\n\n6. Validate the model: Validate the regression model by checking the assumptions, such as linearity, independence, normality, homoscedasticity, and lack of multicollinearity. Perform diagnostic tests to identify and address any outliers or influential observations.\n\n7. Use the regression model to estimate the value of the subject company: Plug in the financial metrics of the subject company into the regression equation to get an estimated value for the company. In the case of a guideline public company transaction method, the regression-derived multiple (revenue, EBITDA, or other financial metric) can be applied to the subject company's financials to estimate its value.\n\n8. Adjust the estimate for marketability and control premiums/discounts: The value derived from the regression analysis is typically based on the prices of publicly traded companies. To account for the lack of marketability and control in a private company, adjust the estimated value by applying appropriate marketability and control premiums or discounts.\n\n9. Perform a sensitivity analysis: Conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of changing financial metrics on the value estimate. This helps understand the robustness of the valuation and identify areas of uncertainty.\n\n10. Compare the valuation to other methods: The Regression Method's estimate should be compared to other valuation methods, such as the comparable sales method, cost approach, and discounted cash flow analysis. The final valuation will be a synthesis of all the available information and techniques.", "shortest_response": "The Guideline Company Transaction Method (GCTM) is a valuation approach that uses the financial data of comparable, or \"guidelines,\" public companies to estimate the value of a private company. Regression analysis is a statistical tool that helps in this process by identifying the relationship between the financial metrics of the guideline companies and the sale price.\n\nHere's a simplified explanation of how regression analysis could be used in the Guideline Company Transaction Method:\n\n1. Identify a group of public companies that are similar to the private company in terms of industry, size, stage of development, business model, etc. These will be your guideline companies.\n\n2. Gather financial data for these guideline companies, including the financial metric you're interested in valuing (e.g., earnings, revenue, cash flow), and the sale price of the guideline company.\n\n3. Use regression analysis to determine the mathematical relationship between the financial metric and the sale price of the guideline companies. The regression equation will have the general form y = a + bx, where y is the sale price, x is the financial metric, a is the y-intercept (indicating the price if the financial metric has a value of zero), and b is the slope (indicating the change in price associated with a unit change in the financial metric).\n\n4. Calculate the value of the private company using the regression equation. To do this, substitute the financial metric of the private company into the equation. The result will be an estimated value for the private company.", "input_size": 25, "output_sizes": [569, 509, 333, 585, 809, 544, 572, 641, 539, 709], "output_mean": 581.0, "output_std": 119.18, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 540.25, "p50": 570.5, "p75": 627.0, "p99": 800.0}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 19.27154}, {"sample_id": "17f27801fac55ffd", "prompt_id": "88adc5cd33e27f18", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Here is a SAS code:\n/\\*%include '/u98/sas/actuarial/US\\_ESC/Macros/AS400\\_SetExpVars.sas';\\*/\nlibname JHTemp '/u98/sas/actuarial/RMT\\_JH/Temp';\nlibname Montage '/u98/sas/actuarial/RMT\\_JH/Montage';\nLibname US\\_ESC '/u98/sas/actuarial/US\\_ESC';\nLibname ESCTemp '/u98/sas/actuarial/US\\_ESC/Temp';\nLibname Account '/u98/sas/actuarial/US\\_ESC/Client\\_Output';\nLibname ImpLoc '/u98/sas/actuarial/US\\_ESC/Import';\n\nlibname DW\\_ACTU\n sqlsvr \n datasrc=\"AIZP1-DW\\_ACTUARY\\_USER\" \n authdomain=\"AIZP1-DW\\_ACTUARY\\_USER\" \n schema=\"MONTAGE\" \n insertbuff=5000 readbuff=5000 READ\\_LOCK\\_TYPE=NOLOCK;\n\n%Let LbNm = Montage;\n%Let Who = Montage;\n%Let LbNmTmp = JHTemp;\n%Let LbNmCli = Account;\n%Let Client = mn;\n%Let PerNum = 202206;\n\n%Let ValDate = '30Jun2022'd;\n%Let InTbl = &LbNm..&Client.\\_MstrSmm\\_&PerNum.\\_PowerPivot2;\n\n/\\*from Montage.mn\\_cnt\\_clm\\_8\\_&pernum.\\*/\n/\\*where InvalidFlag=0 or (InvalidFlag=1 and PrePost2=\"Post 3\")\\*/\n\nGOPTIONS ACCESSIBLE;\noptions obs = max;\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* START HERE \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*;\n\n%Let NumHPP = 144;

Connecting to a SQL Server database: The `DW_ACTU` libname is established to access a database named `AIZP1-DW_ACTUARY_USER` with a specified schema.\n\n3. Setting variables: Several variables are defined for easier referencing later in the code, such as library names, clients, and performance periods. Also, the effective valuation date is defined.\n\n4. Defining variables for historical and future policies, periods, and frequencies: This code sets up the number of historical and future policies and periods, and the frequency for the data (monthly or quarterly).\n\n5.

Engineering Shanks:\n   - Round Shank: The cross-section of this shank is round. They are commonly used for bolts, screws, and other fasteners.\n   - Square Shank: The cross-section of this shank is square. They are often used in applications where a round shank may back out.\n   - Hex Shank: The cross-section of this shank is hexagonal. They are used to provide a grip for tools and prevent them from rolling.\n   - Allen Shank: A shank with a hexagonal cross-section designed to be used with an Allen wrench.\n\nYou can learn more about these shank types through books like \"Knife Anatomy: A Visual Guide to Understanding a Knife\" by Bob Lum and \"Illustrated Book of Woodworking Joints\" by George Jackson.

In today\u2019s society, altruism is considered the highest virtue and is actively promoted through religion, culture, and education. Instead, people who, for selfish reasons, are not willing to give up their own interests are called immoral and evil.\nIn her philosophy, Ayn Rand debunks these common dogmas by showing that altruism, not selfishness, is evil.\nNature does not provide man with automatic survival. This means that in order to live, a person must worry about their own interests. If a doctrine (altruism) says that worrying about one\u2019s interests is evil, then it turns out that the very desire to live is evil. According to Ayn \u200b\u200bRand, no teaching can be eviler.\n\nThe basic principle of altruism is that you must live for others and serve the happiness of others. Ayn Rand asks a simple question that shows the falsity of this principle \u2013 \u201cwhy?\u201d. Why is it moral to serve the happiness of others and not your own? Why is it moral to worry about other people\u2019s interests and not your own? Why is it moral when others feel pleasure thanks to your help, but immoral when you feel pleasure?\nFor hundreds of years, people who promoted altruism have not found a rational answer to these questions. The only thing that allows them to justify the requirement to be altruistic is mysticism: supernatural, unearthly, irrational. Altruism is supported only by the belief that it is right. Rationality is incompatible with altruism.\n\n \nBeing altruistic means sacrificing yourself. And the victim cannot be happy. Altruists, giving in to their own values and needs, expect others to do the same. And when that doesn\u2019t happen, they get angry: \u201cWhy do I do everything for them, and they do nothing for me?\u201d Thus, altruism causes constant injustice, double standards, unresolved conflicts, and contradictions.\n\nRational selfishness is man\u2019s only path to happiness. It is important to understand that it is not about neglecting other people, but about making your life and your happiness a priority. Helping others should be an act of generosity, not a moral obligation.", "longest_response": "Altruism, defined as selfless concern for others, is typically praised in society. Ayn Rand, however, argues that it's selfishness, not altruism, that promotes immorality. Nature requires that individuals prioritize their own interests for survival. If altruism considers self-interest evil, then a fundamental desire to live becomes problematic. Rand questions the moral justification for prioritizing others' happiness over one's own.\n\nThe basic altruist principle is self-sacrifice for others' happiness. However, Rand challenges this by asking: why are self-sacrifice and serving others' interests moral, but not one's own? She contends that altruism lacks rational justification and relies on mysticism for support.\n\nAltruism involves self-sacrifice, which inherently limits happiness. Altruists, while promoting self-sacrifice, expect reciprocation but feel resentment when it's not given. This leads to ongoing injustice, double standards, and contradictions.\n\nRational selfishness, prioritizing one's own life and happiness, is the path to true fulfillment. This doesn't mean disregarding others but recognizing that helping others should stem from generosity, not a moral obligation.", "shortest_response": "Altruism, defined as selfless concern for others, is widely considered a virtue in society, while self-interest is often depicted as immoral. Ayn Rand challenges this viewpoint, arguing that altruism is harmful, not selflessness. Rand asserts that humans, who must act to survive, are morally justified in prioritizing their own interests. The principle of altruism, demanding self-sacrifice for others, lacks rational justification and relies on mysticism for support. Altruism leads to injustice, conflicts, and double standards, as it encourages martyrdom and expects others to reciprocate, resulting in resentment. Instead, a rational approach to self-interest is the path to personal happiness, with helping others a generous choice, not a moral duty.", "input_size": 539, "output_sizes": [248, 263, 232, 247, 210, 285, 200, 269, 173, 256], "output_mean": 238.3, "output_std": 32.85, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 215.5, "p50": 247.5, "p75": 261.25, "p99": 283.56}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 7.84146}, {"sample_id": "0f3d3a8f82a790d9", "prompt_id": "922ff8a5ffcd5a3b", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Need a process guide for creating New Prepaid Account in salesforce (telecom Operator) CRM for call center agent to use 500 words", "longest_response": "Title: Process Guide for Creating New Prepaid Account in Salesforce CRM (Telecom Operator) for Call Center Agents\n\nIntroduction:\nThis process guide will help call center agents create new prepaid accounts in Salesforce CRM for a telecom operator.

Let's break it down to make it easier to understand.\n\n1. **Precision Farming**: Precision farming is a farming management concept based on observing, measuring, and responding to inter and intra-field variability in crops. This can involve the use of technology such as GPS, GIS, remote sensing, yield monitors, and variable rate technology for application of seed, fertilizers, and pesticides.\n\n2. **Organic Hydroponics**: Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent. Making it organic might involve using organic nutrient solutions and avoiding potentially harmful chemicals. However, it's important to note that the term \"organic hydroponics\" is a topic of debate in the farming community because the soil-less nature of hydroponics seems to contradict the organic certification standards.\n\n3. **Bamboo Greenhouse**: Bamboo is a sustainable and renewable resource that can be used to construct greenhouses. Its strength, rapid growth, and resistance to insects make it an attractive choice.\n\n4. **IoT (Internet of Things)**: IoT can be integrated into this system to monitor and control various factors such as temperature, humidity, pH levels, nutrient levels, and plant health. Sensors can collect data, while actuators (like automated irrigation systems) can respond based on the data.\n\n5. **Renewable Energy**: Solar, wind, or hydroelectric power can be used to power the IoT devices and other systems in the greenhouse, making it more sustainable. Solar panels can be installed on the roof of the greenhouse, while wind turbines or hydroelectric generators can be used if suitable locations are available.\n\n6. **Sustainability & Circular Economy**: The entire system is designed with sustainability in mind. The use of renewable energy, organic farming methods, and bamboo for construction minimizes the carbon footprint and promotes ecological balance. The circular economy aspect could be achieved by reusing water, nutrients, and energy as much as possible. For example, nutrient-rich water can be recycled, and energycan be reused or stored for later use.\n\nThis integrated approach to farming can lead to increased efficiency, reduced environmental impact, and higher quality produce. However, it's important to consider the feasibility of this setup in terms of costs, technology availability, and local regulations. Also, the challenge of maintaining organic certification in a hydroponic system needs to be addressed.", "shortest_response": "That's a fascinating concept! Let's break down your question into several parts and discuss each one:\n\n1. **Precision Farming**: Precision farming is a farming management concept based on observing, measuring, and responding to inter- and intra-field variability in crops. It typically involves the use of technology such as satellites, aerial photos, and sensors.\n\n2. **Organic Hydroponics**: Organic hydroponics combines the benefits of organic farming (no synthetic fertilizers or pesticides) with the water-saving techniques of hydroponics (growing plants without soil). However, because organic farming restricts the use of synthetic substances, it can be challenging to ensure optimal soil-less nutrient management.\n\n3. **Bamboo Greenhouse**: Bamboo is a sustainable, renewable, and strong material that can be used for greenhouse construction. It has the added benefits of being pest-resistant and carbon-sequestering, contributing to a circular economy.\n\n4. **IoT (Internet of Things)**: IoT devices in farming can collect real-time data on environmental conditions (like temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels), plant growth, and pest or disease outbreaks. This data can be used to optimize farming practices and reduce waste.\n\n5. **Renewable Energy**: Renewable energy sources (like solar, wind, or hydroelectric power) can power greenhouses, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Solar panels, for example, can be installed on the greenhouse roof, generating electricity to power the ecosystem.\n\n6. **Sustainability & Circular Economy**: Sustainability involves meeting current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. A circular economy aims to redefine growth, focusing on preserving and enhancing natural capital, optimizing resource yields, and minimizing system risks by managing finite stocks and renewable flows.

This topology is characterized by two distinct layers: Leaf and Spine, as the name suggests.\n\n1. Leaf switches: These are edge devices that are directly connected to servers, hyper-converged infrastructure, storage devices, and other endpoints. Each leaf switch is typically connected to multiple spine switches, forming a Layer 2 \"flat\" network for efficiency and reliability.\n\n2. Spine switches: Positioned in the middle of the topology, spine switches are responsible for passing traffic between leaf switches. Each spine switch connects to all other spine switches and to each leaf switch, creating a mesh interconnect structure. This design ensures equal distribution of the network load and improves scalability, resilience, and low latency by minimizing the number of hops for packet forwarding.\n\nIn ACI fabric, Leaf-Spine topology plays a crucial role in enabling the implementation of a policy-based network architecture. By centralizing policies on the ACI controller, network administrators can apply consistent policies across the entire network for security, traffic management, and application optimization.\n\nThe Leaf-Spine topology offers several advantages in ACI fabric deployments, such as:\n\n- Simplified network design: With a flat Layer 2 network at the leaf layer, the network design can be easily managed and scaled up as new devices are added.\n- High bandwidth: Leaving a sufficient number of gigabit or even 10/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet uplinks between the leaf and spine switches allows for high-speed data transmission while maintaining low latency.\n- Improved network resilience: With multiple connections between leaf and spine switches, the Leaf-Spine topology offers redundant pathways for data traffic.

Their main function is to create and maintain a highly scalable, low-latency, and resilient interconnections between multiple leaf nodes. Spines typically communicate with all leaf nodes, forming a full mesh topology within the spine layer.\n\nIn an ACI fabric using leaf-spine topology, the network is highly dynamic and flexible.

Here's a step-by-step guide to create a custom Google Apps Script that connects your Google Form with a Google Sheet to collect data, calculate input fields, and export the final results to another Google Sheet.\n\n1. Open your Google Form:\n   - Go to google.com/forms\n   - Select the form you wish to use\n\n2. Click `More actions` (three vertical dots on the top right) and then select `Go to live form`.\n\n3. Once in your Google Form, click `Settings` on the right side of the menu.\n\n4. Under the \"Presentation\" tab, scroll down to \"Email notification\", and click on \"Notify respondent\". Toggle on \"Customize notification\" and adjust the subject and message as needed. Save your changes.\n\n5. In the form editor, click `More actions` (three vertical dots) and select `Get form ID`\n    - The form id will appear in the address bar. (e.g. `1aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoP`) Copy the ID for later use.\n\n6. Create a new Google Sheet if you don't already have one for collecting form responses. You can name it something like \"Form Responses.\"\n\n7. Rename the \"Sheet1\" to the name you'd like for your data table (e.g., \"Raw_Data\").\n\n8. In a new Google Sheet, name the sheet as \"Script_Editor\" or any name that makes sense to you.\n\n9. In the \"Script_Editor\" sheet, click on `Extensions` > `Apps Script`. This will open the Google Apps Script Editor.\n\n10. Replace the content of the script with the following code, replacing `YOUR_FORM_ID` with the form's ID you got earlier:\n\n```javascript\nfunction onFormSubmit(e) {\n  var formResponses = e.namedValues;\n\n  var rawDataSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName('Raw_Data');\n\n  // Add headers if it doesn't exist\n  if (!rawDataSheet.getRange(1, 1).getValue()) {\n    rawDataSheet.getRange(1, 1).setValue('Timestamp');\n    var headers = formResponses;\n    for (let i = 1; i < headers.length; i++) {\n      rawDataSheet.getRange(1, i + 1).setValue(headers[i].toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]/g, ''));\n    }\n    rawDataSheet.getRange(2, 1, rawDataSheet.getLastRow() - 1, rawDataSheet.getLastColumn()).setValues(formResponses);\n  } else {\n    var row = rawDataSheet.getLastRow() + 1;\n    for (let key in formResponses) {\n      rawDataSheet.getRange(row, 1 + key.charCodeAt(0) - 65).setValue(formResponses[key]);\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Calculate final values and export to another sheet\n  finalValues(formResponses);\n};\n\nfunction finalValues(formResponses) {\n  var finalResultsSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName('Final_Results');\n\n  var calculationFormula = `=IF(A1>B1, \"Result1\", IF(A1=B1, \"Draw\", \"Result2\"))`; // This formula is example of a calculation\n                                                                                   // Adjust this formula as per your requirements\n  var finalCalculatedValues = [];\n\n  // Loop through the form responses to find the values for calculation\n  for (let key in formResponses) {\n    var cellValue = formResponses[key];\n    if (key === 'A1' || key === 'B1') {\n      finalCalculatedValues.push(cellValue);\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Perform calculations using the calculation formula\n  var result = spreadsheetFunctions.EVALUATE(calculationFormula, finalCalculatedValues);\n\n  finalResultsSheet.getRange(finalResultsSheet.getLastRow() + 1, 1).setValue(formResponses['Name']); // Get respondent's name\n  finalResultsSheet.getRange(finalResultsSheet.getLastRow() + 1, 2).setValue(result); // Final calculated value\n}\n\nfunction onOpen() {\n  FormApp.getActiveForm().addOnFormSubmit(onFormSubmit);\n}\n```\n\n11. Save the script with a new file name.\n\n12. Click `Files` > `Manage Versions` (or `Untitled`).\n\n13. Rename the current version and click `Save New Version`.\n\n14. Go back to your \"Form Responses\" sheet, click on `Extensions` > `Apps Script`. Make sure the script name you saved is displayed in the sidebar.\n\n15. Click `Run` > `On Form Submit`, and the script will be triggered the next time your form receives a new response.\n\n16. You don't need to do anything else, but keep the \"Script_Editor\" sheet open as we will add more functions in the upcoming steps.\n\n17. To calculate input fields in the \"Final_Results\" sheet, check the formula in the `finalValues` function, and adjust it to suit your specific calculations.\n\n18.

The ListView displays the name and stock name of each company. Users can search for specific companies using the search bar.", "shortest_response": "To create a Flutter code that fetches a list of companies using GraphQL and renders them in a ListView, you'll need a few things:\n\n1. A GraphQL client, such as `graphql_flutter`.\n2. A way to provide the variables for the query, like `Provider` or `StatefulWidget`.\n3. A structure to hold fetched companies.\n4. The UI for displaying the list.\n\nHere's a basic example to get you started, assuming you have a `network_interface` package or other networking solution in place:\n\nFirst, define the company model:\n\n```dart\nclass Company {\n  final int id;\n  final String name;\n  final String stockName;\n  final String stockCode;\n  final String market;\n\n  Company({this.id, this.name, this.stockName, this.stockCode, this.market});\n\n  factory Company.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {\n    return Company(\n      id: json['id'],\n      name: json['name'],\n      stockName: json['stockName'],\n      stockCode: json['stockCode'],\n      market: json['market'],\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNext, create a GraphQL query:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:graphql_flutter/graphql_flutter.dart';\n\nQueryOptions getCompaniesQueryOptions(String q, int first) {\n  return QueryOptions(\n    document: gql(companyQuery),\n    variables: <String, dynamic>{\n      'q': q,\n      'first': first,\n    },\n  );\n}\n\nconst companyQuery = gqlr'''\nquery companies($q: String, $first: Int) {\n  companies(q: $q, first: $first) {\n    nodes {\n      id\n      name\n      stockName\n      stockCode\n      market\n    }\n    pageInfo {\n      endCursor\n      hasNextPage\n    }\n  }\n}\n''';\n```\n\nCreate the UI for displaying companies:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n\nclass CompaniesList extends StatelessWidget {\n  final List<Company> companies;\n\n  CompaniesList({Key key, this.companies}) : super(key: key);\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return ListView.builder(\n      itemCount: companies.length,\n      itemBuilder: (context, index) {\n        return ListTile(\n          title: Text(companies[index].name),\n          subtitle: Text('${companies[index].stockName}: ${companies[index].stockCode} (${companies[index].market})'),\n        );\n      },\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, create the widget to fetch and display companies:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:graphql_flutter/graphql_flutter.dart';\n\nclass CompaniesScreen extends StatelessWidget {\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    final String q = 'test'; // Add a filter as you see fit.\n\n    return Query(\n      options: getCompaniesQueryOptions(q, 10), // Fetch 10 items at a time.\n      builder: (QueryResult result, {VoidCallback refetch, FetchMore fetchMore}) {\n        if (result.hasException) {\n          return Center(child: Text(result.exception.toString()));\n        }\n\n        final List<Company> companies = (result.data['companies'] as dynamic)['nodes']\n            .map((node) => Company.fromJson(node))\n            .toList();\n\n        return CompaniesList(companies: companies);\n      },\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that this example doesn't handle pagination yet. To add it, follow the GraphQL specification for pagination (https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Pagination) and update the `getCompaniesQueryOptions` method to include the proper variables. Also, remember to integrate this code into your app structure, like routing or widget dependencies.\n\nGood luck, and happy coding!", "input_size": 91, "output_sizes": [1471, 1748, 1754, 1318, 1096, 1024, 1413, 1683, 1650, 1010], "output_mean": 1416.7, "output_std": 280.01, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 1151.5, "p50": 1442.0, "p75": 1674.75, "p99": 1753.46}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 53.41255}, {"sample_id": "4808920b2ca3c476", "prompt_id": "8981d70e984a4a8f", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "I want to give a gift to my 45 year old aunt.

would be by now this is going to be really really helpful for you you've probably tried everything under the sun in order to fix it but every time you do something every time you make even an inch of progress something just drags you back down and so you work your ass off again to try and get back up to where you want to be it could be financially it could be with your relationships it could be the way that you look and you make a bit of progress and then something drags you back down again and no matter what happens you just can't seem to get everything that you want if that sounds familiar keep listening because I got something for you which is really really simple and is going to really really uh easily help you fix it so okay so I'll switch over to the iPad right now this is a very very incredibly lifelike drawing of a Summoner Mountain down here is you once again very like flag here is base camp and then up the top is the summit okay oops I just erased that up the top is the summit okay I'm just going to briefly outline these Concepts where you are right now you're on what we call the hamster wheel right where you're constantly working your ass off but it feels like you're not really getting anywhere or you're not getting anywhere as fast as what you should be it feels inefficient and it feels like you have a high level of friction right things are just more difficult than what they should be base camp is where you're at Square zero you're at Ground Zero you're just about to start your climb everything's totally neutral and the Summit is where you want to be this is where you're the ultimate Dad this is where you're the ultimate partner or husband this is where you're making the money you're living your dream life this is where everything is great your Health's incredible your relationships are incredible and your wealth is also so incredible right everything is absolutely on song and that's obviously where you want to be and one of the things that we see that prevents a lot of dudes from actually getting to the summit Step One is they don't know what Summit they're actually climbing what is it that they're working towards a lot of guys get confused because there are so many different Summers that we can climb I mean let's think about it you a lot of guys go out and they chase money they chose huge amounts of money they just want to build a massive amount of wealth a lot of other guys want to chase lifestyle some guys Trace Chase drugs some guys chase women some guys Chase there's so many different things that we can chase but what is absolutely certain is that if you climb up an alternate Summit because remember there are millions of these Summits you've got money up here you've got you know drugs over here you've got women over on another one you've got whatever we've got all these different goals that we can chase all these different Summers that we can chase but if they're not in an alignment with what we actually want when we reach them we're going to be totally unfilled and that's where we climb up one mountain we come back down we climb up another we come back down and we never feel like we're actually getting anywhere so the very first thing that we need to do is we need to get clear on well what is my Summit what do I actually want from this life when I'm old and gray and smelly and my Skin's all falling out and I've got tubes up my ass down my throat up my up my nose there's a machine helping my lungs to pump what do I want to look back on on my life how do I want to have envisioned my life so that's the first thing we need to get really really clear on what do we want our Summit to be then the next thing after that that we need to do is we need to get out of the hamster wheel right we need to get off this world because whenever we're stuck here on the hamster wheel we're just going around and around and around and around in circles and we'll never actually make it up the mountain it'll never happen so the first step is that we need to get from here on the hamster wheel onto base camp and what base camp looks like is this you've got no friction there's nothing holding you back those anchors those things which are just dragging you down all the time you don't have them you have incredible energy you have no anxiety you're managing your stress really well you'll never evade stress completely in life but you'll know how to deal with it you're on point physically mentally and you're clear on the direction that you need to go that is what we call base camp and once you get to base camp that's where you can actually start the ascent at the summit see one of the other big reasons why so many guys never actually make it up this Summit is because they're trying to climb on the biggest climb of their life stressed out anxious with low testosterone terrible energy they just feel awful can you imagine climbing Mount Everest and feeling like that it's never going to happen and see the thing climbing to your goal and climbing to your whole life's purpose which is essentially what your summit is it's the biggest climate you'll ever do in your life and it's permanent if you're trying to do that bad boy with no energy stressed out anxious low testosterone feeling awful you're never going to make it and so what we need to do is we need to get you to base camp first where you're feeling really good and then we can begin the climb and so the next thing once we've got you here at base camp what do you need when you're at base camp you need this you need a map if you don't have a map you're never going to make it up the mountain I don't know if you guys have ever done any mountain climb but I've done a fair bit and so it always helps to learn how to actually get up to the top because if you wing it on the way it's really really slow the next thing that you always need is you need a guide you need a sherpa as such Edmund Hillary Sir Edmund Hillary the man the first man to Summit Mount Everest or the first white man I think that was able to Summit Mount Everest he failed twice before he only got it on the third time do you know the difference between the first two times and the third it's the third time you had some sherpets he had a sherbet tensing Norge was his name right who actually helped him guide guide him all the way up the mountain and so what we need if we're going to get from base camp all the way up to the summit is we need to have a map a plan and we need to have a guide on how you're going to get there when you have those two things that is when you'll be able to get to the summit okay and so this is really really incredibly important so what I want you to take away from from this video is this first of all if you want to get to where you want to be if you want to be able to actually make more money if you want to be able to be a better dad you want to be a better partner you want to be happier you want to be healthy you want to feel better well first of all you need to know what the Summit is you need to know where your summit is you need to know what game you're playing not somebody else's game not society's game not someone says hey you should be a doctor you should be making this amount of money this is how you should be as a dad you need to have exactly three kids what game are you playing so it's the first thing Clarity the second thing after that is we need to get you off the hamster wheel and get you up to base camp because when you're at base camp that's when you can actually get up to the top and the third thing is you need a map and you need a guide and that is how you get there you're not just going to wing it on the way up because as there are going to be obstacles as we all know you need to make sure that you have a plan on how you're going to get to your summit and you need to have someone there who's going to hold you accountable and guide you the whole way okay on that note guys I'll leave you all to it if you have any questions as always feel free to reach out I hope this helps\"\nVideo Summary:", "longest_response": "The video, titled \"(20)

The message (or data) M to be authenticated is converted into a fixed-size hash using a cryptographic hash function H (like SHA-256 or SHA-512).\n3. The key K is padded and then XORed with the inner bits of the hash from step 2. This produces an intermediate value.\n4. The original hash from step 2 is then passed through the hash function H again using the intermediate value from step 3 as the input. This produces the HMAC.\n\nWhen the receiver gets the HMAC and the data, it performs the same HMAC computation using the shared secret key.

All information and computations in a classical computer are based on these bits.\n\n2. **Quantum Binary System**: In a quantum computer, the smallest unit of information is a quantum bit or qubit.

I took AP Computer Science & 6 courses in community college, and will complete 3 more before transferring. I gained mobile development experience through my internship, learned several frameworks through extra-curricular projects, and participated in 4 hackathons. This November, my team became a finalist for the Google Health Case Competition working on improving patient adherence to tailored nursing care-plans.\n\nAs an aspiring programmer, I looked to community college courses to build on my foundation from AP Computer Science. These courses explored the depths and complexity of CS. In Data Science (CIS-9), we used NumPy and Pandas (Python libraries) with a touch of machine learning to perform data analysis. In Assembly (CIS-21JA), we translated common Python functions to assembly instructions to understand how code executes on the CPU. These rigorous courses required constant engagement in novel areas and vastly improved the breadth and strength of my CS foundation.\n\nIn my internship I looked forward to being a productive software engineer, and also understanding how a team turns an idea into a polished product. To prepare, I built SuppStack, a website for users to share their nutritional supplements. I learned about the core components of a website: backend (NodeJS & Express), frontend (ReactJS & Tailwind), and database (MySQL). In my internship, I learned programmatic collaboration skills through Git (version control software), worked with PM & Design, and structured effective timelines. As the lead intern, I implemented user-authentication, led migration to Expo Go (a platform that allows us to deploy code instantly), and mentored other interns by supervising & advising them through their projects. I collaborated effectively and learned the development structure of polished apps. \n\nThrough my courses, projects, and internship, I\u2019ve developed my foundation and discipline to tackle complex topics in upper-division courses. I know computer science skills are a tool to solve problems beyond the screen\u2013 like issues in healthcare we began exploring in our Google Health Case Competition. I\u2019m eager to build these skills as I progress through UC.\n\n-----\n\nPrompt: What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?\nEssay: I\u2019ve spent over 150 hours in 2 years volunteering for 7 Cups, a counseling organization. I connected with teens as a listener to support them through mental illnesses. Concurrently, I learned more about mental illnesses and three psychotherapies through two community college classes, piles of books, and discussions with professionals. Finally, I mentored other volunteers\u2013 and taught them how to mentor, expanding impact. \nEarly on, I connected with a teen named Kinga (altered for confidentiality). We talked to combat her alcoholism, supplementing her sessions with her therapist. Inspired by her, and to improve my listening, I read resources including The Molecule of More, Motivational Enhancement Therapy Manual, The Big Book of AA. I also took classes at community colleges, PSYC1 - General Psychology and PSYC4 - Abnormal Psychology, to better understand psychotherapies. After a year working together, Kinga texted me: \u201cI think [connecting with] you allowed me to stop thinking that every human being is evil with bad intentions, and I\u2019ve been able to surround myself with great people.\u201d She\u2019s over a year sober, picking up pastel art and ballet again, and drastically improving her relationships with family and friends.\nA third of the time I listened to teens, they expressed dissatisfaction with previous listeners. As one of the more experienced volunteers, I took on improving listener training. Growing through leadership roles, I became a listener coach. I personally mentored 12 listeners for over half a year to improve their listening and knowledge of different illnesses. I also taught them how to mentor, reaching over 50 other volunteers. Finally, I spearheaded discussions on adapting psychotherapy techniques to issues, ex. CBT for exercise motivation, that taught over 70 more listeners.\nMy community-building ability fostered strong long-term relationships with 11 teens, like Kinga, to help them manage mental illnesses. I also helped over 40 others with short-term problems. I\u2019m eager to continue fostering strong relationships using my community building skills. UC schools offer many opportunities to deepen these skills and connect through community service. Community strengthening with UC students through clubs like UCLA\u2019s DevX and Berkeley\u2019s BluePrint would be fantastic.\n\n-----\n\nPrompt: What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?\nEssay: My greatest skill is turning curiosity into passion. I first did this with 6 years in Chess; I became an expert level player and consistently ranked in the US top 70 for my age. Along the way, I was a three-time state champion and finalist, won an international tournament, and won over $10,000. As a wrestler, I also quickly advanced to varsity-level, despite being new to wrestling with no athletic background.\n\nIn chess, I spent almost every moment I could preparing to compete. On a school-day, I woke up at 6:30 and practiced tactics/calculation for an hour. After school, I went to our living room computer to play the daily online blitz tournament. After finishing my homework, I was back to studying books like Dvoretsky\u2019s Endgame Manual and Jacob Aagaard\u2019s series on middlegames. Even if I wasn\u2019t motivated one day, I always showed up. \n\nFor wrestling, I initially focused on technical knowledge about the sport and athletic performance. I consumed books and recorded matches, filled scrap pages with notes and even asked my coach so many questions that he limited me to three per practice. Outside of practice, I trained and cooked based on research about maximizing athletic performance. Training in chess first taught me to explore the details that go into mastery.\n\nMy first match of my senior season (second-year) was against a 4 star recruit. Like chess, I started to get caught up in a flow state. I saw my opponent kept too much weight on his lead leg and had a very narrow stance. I dominated the first two periods as I used this information to score takedowns with ankle picks and a blast double. All my decisions started to become coldly calculated based on precision. Wrestling, much like Chess, was now a science of the small details.\n\nJust like I immersed myself in Chess and Wrestling, I do the same in my academic pursuits. I start by breaking them down to sub-problems, learn from more-experienced individuals, and practice solving multiple variations. I really enjoy turning curiosity into passion.\n\n-----\n\nPrompt: Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time.\nEssay: During senior year, I coached a group of ten elementary students (ages 7-9) in Chess. It was a self-motivated initiative. I launched it in response to neighborhood children who were excited to find out I won over $10,000 playing in chess tournaments. I led them from learning to move their first pieces to their first scholastic chess tournament. In the process, I learned to build relationships and create a dynamic learning environment. \nIn the beginning, classes were terrible. I\u2019m a varsity athlete, a focused student, and try to face challenges head-on. But every week ten kids would come eager to learn, and I was terrified. I was a three-time state finalist, but accolades didn\u2019t matter here. I struggled to structure classes and connect with students. I freestyled classes, finding kids quietly uninterested. My students Diya and Rohan often looked particularly blank.\nFrustrated, I contacted my first chess coach for advice. He talked about our strengths/weaknesses, interests outside of chess, and favorite moments with all of us; it was sweet\u2026 but seemingly useless. Only after discussing this conversation with a friend did I realize my coach was successful because of his bond with us.\nMoving forward, I made efforts to learn about my students and welcome natural relationships. I spent time one-on-one and in smaller groups during breaks and after classes. We played games like tag, Monopoly, and chess (but I was blindfolded!). Reticent students soon became expressive learners, sharing their explorations of constellations, cooking, the world of Harry Potter, and more. By connecting with the kids, I enabled an open inquisitive environment. Diya recounted her little brother\u2019s antics and Rohan shared karate techniques. \nI compiled an array of Chess books and videos to create a curriculum. In the five months before their first tournament, my students learned tactical ideas as well as openings like the Scotch and Ruy Lopez. At the tournament, all had positive records. Three kids placed top 10 in the beginner division. They went from distracted individuals to motivated players. And my role transformed from disengaged instructor to connected mentor.", "longest_response": "As I embark on my journey at the esteemed University, I am excited to channel my diverse experiences, community-building skills, and unwavering passion for solving problems to excel as a computer science student.

While the battles on the Western Front in Europe and the Middle East have traditionally garnered the most attention, the Home Front\u2014the civil societies that supported these efforts\u2014also played a crucial role in shaping the outcome of the war. This article aims to shed light on the pivotal contribution of the Home Front, focusing on the experiences of the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany during World War I.\n\nThe United States: A Late Entrant with a Vital Contribution\n\nThe United States initially maintained a policy of neutrality during the early years of World War I. However, escalating atrocities and the sinking of U.S. ships by German U-boats eroded popular support for neutrality. In April 1917, the U.S. entered the conflict, with the Home Front swiftly mobilizing to support the war effort.\n\nFactories were repurposed for war production, while women, who had been gradually gaining access to employment outside the home, took on more roles as men left for the frontlines. The Committee on Public Information, led by George Creel, engaged in a propaganda campaign designed to mobilize domestic support and discourage dissent.\n\nThe United Kingdom: War by Sea, Land, and Industry\n\nBritain, as one of the first countries to enter the war, faced immense challenges on the Home Front. The nation's maritime prowess played a crucial role in maintaining the transatlantic supply line, but it also made the country a prime target for German U-boats. The resulting losses and the threat of famine spurred a wave of patriotism known as the \"Little England\" movement, characterized by increased food rationing, reduced luxury spending, and support for the war.\n\nWorkers in munitions factories faced dangerous conditions, leading to high rates of injury and death. Nevertheless, the Home Front's industrial output significantly contributed to the Allied war effort, particularly in munitions, ships, and food supplies.\n\nFrance: Resilience in the Face of Devastation\n\nFrance was one of the hardest-hit countries on the Home Front. Battles such as the Somme and Verdun left vast tracts of land devastated, and millions of refugees flooded the cities. The French government implemented extensive rationing measures, redistributed resources, and created the National Union of French Women (Union nationale des feminines de France) to encourage women's war work.\n\nBy 1917, France ranked second only to the United States in arms production, helping to counterbalance the manpower shortage caused by heavy casualties on the Western Front.\n\nGermany: Struggling to Maintain the War Effort\n\nGermany's Home Front faced unique challenges due to the nation's strategic decision to rely heavily on imports, making itself vulnerable to blockades by the Allies. Food shortages, inflation, and labor unrest plagued the war effort, exacerbated by the government's failure to distribute resources evenly and effectively.\n\nWomen played an increasingly essential role in the German Home Front, working in factories and agriculture while their husbands, fathers, and brothers served on the frontlines. Despite these efforts, Germany's Home Front ultimately proved unable to sustain a prolonged war against the Allies.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Home Front's role in World War I cannot be overstated. The contributions of civilians, through war production, rationing, and volunteering, played a crucial part in sustaining their respective war efforts. The experiences of the Home Front provide valuable lessons about the resilience, creativity, and resourcefulness of civil societies facing extraordinary challenges.\n\nAs we commemorate the centenary of World War I, it is essential to remember the experiences of those on the Home Front, who played a vital role in shaping the world we know today. Their stories serve as a reminder of the indomitable human spirit and the importance of unity and cooperation in times of adversity.", "shortest_response": "Title: The Home Front: A Pivotal Role in World War I\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhile the battlefields of World War I (1914-1918) are often the focus of historical narratives, it is essential to remember the crucial contribution of the home front. The home front refers to the civilian populace and their efforts to support the war effort, whether through economic contributions, social changes, or moral support for soldiers. This article explores the significant role the home front played during World War I.\n\nEconomic Contributions\n\nThe home front played a vital role in ensuring the continuation of the industrial and agricultural sectors, which were essential for the war effort. Governments implemented measures such as rationing, price controls, and labour conscription to maintain these sectors while their men were away at war. Women, in particular, stepped up to fill roles previously held by men, working in factories, shipyards, and on farms. The famous Rosie the Riveter poster from the United States encapsulates this spirit of female empowerment and industriousness.\n\nSocial Changes\n\nWorld War I ushered in significant social changes on the home front. Women's roles expanded beyond the home, leading to a reevaluation of traditional gender roles. The war also highlighted issues of social justice, with a surge in labor unionism, anti-war protests, and calls for political reform. Despite these advancements, the war also led to increased nationalism, xenophobia, and social unrest, particularly in societies with significant immigrant populations.\n\nMoral Support\n\nThe home front provided unwavering moral support to soldiers, which was crucial in maintaining the resilience of both the troops and the home front. Family letters, care packages, and fundraising events helped keep spirits high, even as the war dragged on and casualties mounted. The Red Cross and other volunteer organizations played a critical role in providing comfort and care to soldiers, as well as assisting with relief efforts for civilian communities affected by the war.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe home front was an integral part of the World War I experience, contributing significantly to the war effort through economic contributions, social change, and moral support. The experiences of the home front shaped the post-war world, ushering in a new era of women's rights, labor reform, and social justice movements. As we remember and honor the sacrifices made during World War I, it is essential to acknowledge the vital role of the home front in shaping this significant chapter of human history.", "input_size": 16, "output_sizes": [746, 701, 674, 558, 924, 541, 689, 673, 774, 684], "output_mean": 696.4, "output_std": 102.4, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 673.25, "p50": 686.5, "p75": 734.75, "p99": 910.5}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 22.60302}, {"sample_id": "ed3681c6c5ea302c", "prompt_id": "0cd303168776424b", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "What is a word for new to parenting?", "longest_response": "The term \"new parent\" or \"first-time parent\" is commonly used to describe someone who has recently started parenting.

And how to implement both in Java using ANTLR?", "longest_response": "An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and a Parse Tree are related concepts in compiler design and language theory, but they serve slightly different purposes and have some differences in their structure and use.\n\n1. **Parse Tree**: A Parse Tree is a tree that represents the syntactic structure of a program, as established by a parser (a program that reads a string of symbols and determines if it follows the syntax of a given formal grammar). Each node in the parse tree corresponds to a production rule in the grammar and represents a construct in the source code. The parse tree is not typically optimized and can be quite large due to the 1-to-1 mapping with the grammar rules.\n\n2. **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: An AST is a more compact and structured representation of the parse tree that focuses solely on the meaning and structure of the source code, abstracting away the details of the grammar. An AST is typically built by traversing the parse tree and combining or rearranging nodes as necessary to better represent the underlying concepts. The goal of an AST is to make the structure and meaning of the program easier for subsequent processes, such as code generation, static analysis, or refactoring.\n\nTo implement both AST and Parse Tree using ANTLR (a popular open-source parser generator), you would first create a grammar file (.g4) that defines the structure of your language. Then, you can generate the lexer (.java) and parser (.java) from the grammar file using the ANTLR processor.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Create a grammar file (example.g4) for your language:\n\n```\ngrammar Example;\n\nprog: statements+;\nstatements: statement+;\nstatement: expr \";\" | ID \"=\" expr \";\";\nexpr: TERM ((\"+\" | \"-\") TERM)*;\nTERM: FACTOR ((\"*\" | \"/\") FACTOR)*;\nFACTOR: (\"+\" | \"-\")? ID | (\"(\" expr \")\") | INTEGER;\nID: [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z\u064e-\u064a\u064e\u06c7\\_0-9]* ;\nINTEGER: [0-9]+;\nWS : [ \\t]+ -> skip ;\n```\n\n2. Generate the lexer and parser:\n\n```sh\njava org.antlr.v4.Tool example.g4\n```\n\n3. Implement a listener or visitor extension to traverse the parsed trees (Parse Tree) and construct an AST.\n\nHere's a simple example of a listener that constructs an AST (in this case, a concrete syntax tree without any optimization):\n\n```java\npackage example;\n\nimport org.antlr.v4.runtime.*;\nimport org.antlr.v4.runtime.tree.*;\n\npublic class ExampleBaseListener extends ParseTreeListener {\n    private ExampleParser.ProgContext root;\n    private ExampleParser.StatementsContext statementsCtx;\n    private ExampleParser.StatementContext statementCtx;\n    private ExampleParser.ExprContext exprCtx;\n    private ExampleParser.TermContext termCtx;\n    private ExampleParser.FactorContext factorCtx;\n    private ExampleParser.IDContext idCtx;\n    private ExampleParser.IntegerContext integerCtx;\n\n    @Override\n    public void enterProg(ExampleParser.ProgContext ctx) {\n        this.root = ctx;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void enterStatements(ExampleParser.StatementsContext ctx) {\n        this.statementsCtx = ctx;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void enterStatement(ExampleParser.StatementContext ctx) {\n        this.statementCtx = ctx;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void enterExpr(ExampleParser.ExprContext ctx) {\n        this.exprCtx = ctx;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void enterTerm(ExampleParser.TermContext ctx) {\n        this.termCtx = ctx;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void enterFactor(ExampleParser.FactorContext ctx) {\n        this.factorCtx = ctx;\n    }\n\n    // ... Other methods to handle various types\n\n    public ExampleNode getAST() {\n        ExampleNode ast = new ExampleNode(root.toStringTree());\n        visit(root);\n        return ast;\n    }\n}\n\n// ExampleNode class should be defined elsewhere\n```\n\nIn this example, the visitor will construct an `ExampleNode` object for each parsed node in the source code and use the node's text to create its children, resulting in an AST.\n\n4. Construct the input string and parse it:\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n    System.out.print(\"Enter your expression: \");\n    String input = reader.readLine();\n\n    ANTLRInputStream inputStream = new ANTLRInputStream(new StringReader(input));\n    ExampleLexer lexer = new ExampleLexer(inputStream);\n    CommonTokenStream tokenStream = new CommonTokenStream(lexer);\n    ExampleParser parser = new ExampleParser(tokenStream);\n\n    ExampleVisitor visitor = new ExampleBaseListener();\n    ParseTree tree = parser.prog();\n    ExampleNode ast = visitor.getAST();\n\n    // Perform operations on the AST\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates the process of implementing Parse Trees and ASTs using ANTLR. Keep in mind that constructing an AST may involve more advanced traversal techniques, optimizations, or other data structures depending on your use case.", "shortest_response": "Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and Parse Tree are both used in computer science for the analysis of programs during parsing, but they serve slightly different purposes and have different structures.\n\n1. Parse Tree: A Parse Tree is a tree that represents the syntactic structure of a string according to a given formal grammar. It's constructed during the parsing process and represents the grammatical structure of the input program without any semantic analysis. Each node in the tree corresponds to a production rule in the grammar. The Parse Tree can serve as a useful debugging tool, making it easier to understand the structure of the program.\n\n2. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST): An AST, on the other hand, is a more simplified and concise representation of the program structure. It abstracts away irrelevant details and only retains the essential structures and relationships. An AST is typically used for semantic analysis (like type checking, scope analysis, and optimization). An AST is built on top of the Parse Tree, by translating the nodes of the Parse Tree into nodes that contain semantic information.\n\nTo implement Parse Trees and ASTs in Java using ANTLR, you would first need to define a grammar that describes the syntax of the language you're working with. ANTLR will then generate a lexer and a parser for your grammar. After parsing, the parser's visitors or listeners can be used to construct the AST. Here's a simplified workflow:\n\n1. Define the grammar (e.g., MyLang.g4) that describes the syntax of your language.\n\n2. Use the ANTLR tool to generate the lexer and parser for your grammar.\n\n3.

This is essential when dealing with complex systems, especially in Quantum Mechanics, Information Theory, and other fields like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.\n\n here are some key concepts in GPT:\n\n1. **Algebra of events**: In classical probabilistic theory, events are represented by subsets of the sample space. In GPT, events can be represented by other structures, such as lattices or order structures, which allow us to describe the relationship between events (e.g., event A is stronger than event B, denoted as A \u2265 B).\n\n2. **Degree of compatibility**: The degree of compatibility between events is a measure of how similar or related they are. In some GPTs, it's defined using a compatibility relation, which is a binary relation \u22ab satisfying the following conditions:\n\t* Compatibility is reflexive (A \u22ab A for all A) and symmetric (A \u22ab B if and only if B \u22ab A).\n\t* If A \u22ab B and B \u22ab C, then A \u22ab C (transitivity)\n\n3. **Degree of probability**: In a GPT, the degree of probability (or more simply, the probability) of an event is a function that maps every event to a real number between 0 and 1, representing the certainty of the event. In addition, the following condition must be satisfied: If A \u2265 B, then the probability of A is greater than or equal to the probability of B (monotonicity).\n\n4. **Conditional probability**: Conditional probability generalizes the classical definition to account for degrees of compatibility. It is a function that maps each pair of events A and B (where B is compatible with A) to a real number between 0 and 1, representing the certainty of A given B has occurred. Generalized conditional probability can be defined in various ways, but a common approach is to use the compatibility relation to derive a compatible event C such that A and C are equivalent (given B).\n\n5. ** Independence**: In GPT, independence is related to the degree of compatibility between events. Two events are independent if they are completely unrelated or have no effect on each other, which is often expressed by saying they are orthogonal or commute. One common way to define independence is through a compatibility relation where A and B are independent if A \u22ab B and vice versa.\n\n6. **Different types of GPTs**: There are several types of GPTs, including:\n\t* **Lattice-valued GPTs**: Events are represented by elements of a complete lattice, and the probability function satisfies several desirable properties like monotonicity and continuity. Examples include MV-algebras and Belnap logic.\n\n\t* **Order- bounded GPTs**: Events are represented by elements of an ordered vector space, and the probability function may have additional properties like subadditivity and subhomogeneity. Examples include fuzzy measure theory, Choquet integrals, and capacity theory.\n\n\t* **Quantum Probabilistic Theories (QPTs)**: QPTs extend classical probability theory to describe quantum systems, where observables are represented by self-adjoint operators on a complex Hilbert space. Quantum states are density matrices, and the probability of an event is given by the trace of the product of the state and the projector corresponding to the event.", "shortest_response": "Generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs) are a mathematical framework that extends classical probability theory to encompass a broader range of measurements and systems. Unlike classical probability, which assumes that all random variables are functions on a sample space, GPTs allow for more general structures.\n\nIn a generalized probabilistic theory, a probability measure is defined on a lattice of propositions or events, rather than on a sample space. The lattice is a partially ordered set, meaning that any two elements have a greatest lower bound (meet) and least upper bound (join). The meet operation represents the combination of propositions, while the join operation represents the disjunction of propositions.\n\nThe key idea behind GPTs is that the lattice structure imposes a natural ordering on the propositions, allowing for a more intuitive and flexible treatment of probabilities. For example, in quantum mechanics, the lattice structure arises from the positive-definite Hermitian operators acting on a Hilbert space, and the probability of a proposition is given by the trace of the operator.\n\nThe advantage of GPTs is that they provide a unified framework for describing the statistics of a wide range of quantum-like systems, such as quantum mechanics, quantum mechanics with measurement noise, and quantum-like systems arising from decoherence and open quantum systems. They also provide a theoretical foundation for the study of classical-quantum interfaces and the development of quantum-inspired algorithms for machine learning and optimization.\n\nSome examples of GPTs include the Birkhoff-von Neumann (BvN) mathematical model of quantum mechanics, the Jordan-von Neumann-Wigner (JvNW) model, the Gleason's theorem model, and the quantum Bayesian model.

Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Create a custom facts script:**\n\nFirst, create a script called `get_ec2_tags` and place it in an Ansible fact location such as `/usr/share/ansible/plugins/facts`. The script will use the boto3 library to interact with AWS and retrieve the instance's tags.\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport boto3\n\nclass EC2TagsFacts(object):\n    def get_facts(self):\n        ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')\n        response = ec2_client.describe_instances(\n            Filters=[{\"Name\": \"tag:MyName\", \"Values\": ['my-value']}])\n        ec2_instances = response[\"Reservations\"][0][\"Instances\"]\n        if ec2_instances:\n            facts = {\"ec2_tags\": ec2_instances[0][\"Tags\"]}\n        else:\n            facts = {\"ec2_tags\": None}\n        return facts\n\n```\n\nReplace `MyName` and `my-value` with your desired EC2 tag key and value, respectively.\n\n2. **Activate the custom fact:**\n\nNow, you need to activate this custom fact in your Playbook by adding the following line at the beginning:\n\n```yaml\n- hosts: all\n  gather_facts: true\n  tasks:\n    - include_role:\n        name: get_ec2_tags_fact\n```\n\nReplace `get_ec2_tags_fact` with the name of your Ansible role that contains the custom facts script from step 1.\n\n3. **Use the custom fact in your Jinja2 template:**\n\nFinally, you can use the `ec2_tags` fact to conditionally include or load the appropriate Jinja2 template in your playbook, like so:\n\n```yaml\n- hosts: all\n  vars:\n    template_file: \"{{ 'template-a.j2' if ec2_tags|length > 0 else 'template-b.j2' }}\"\n  tasks:\n    - copy:\n        dest: \"/path/to/config/file\"\n        content: \"{{ lookup('template', template_file) }}\"\n```\n\nThis example loads the `template-a.j2` file if the EC2 instance has the specified tag, or `template-b.j2` otherwise. You can also include these templates directly within your tasks instead of using the `copy` module.\n\n4. (**Optional**) Remove the custom fact script from the EC2 instance:\n\nBefore your playbook finishes executing, you may want to remove the custom facts script from the instance to prevent any future issues, like so:\n\n```yaml\n- hosts: all\n  tasks:\n    - file:\n        dest: /usr/share/ansible/plugins/facts/get_ec2_tags\n        state: absent\n```", "shortest_response": "To achieve this, you can combine several Ansible features: Ansible tags, Jinja2 templating, and AWS EC2 tag facts. Here's a high-level summary of how you can approach the problem:\n\n1. Use Ansible's `ec2_instance_info` module to gather EC2 instance facts, including tags.\n\n2. Create separate Jinja2 templates for your configuration file based on the desired tag values. In other words, you'll have multiple files, each named according to the tag you want to match, e.g., `my_template_env1.j2`, `my_template_env2.j2`.\n\n3. In your Ansible playbook, use a condition (Jinja2 syntax `{% %}`) to select the appropriate template based on the EC2 instance tag.\n\n4. Use Ansible's `template` module to render the selected template and save the result as your configuration file on the EC2 instance.\n\nHere's a sample playbook demonstrating this process:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Gather EC2 instance facts\n  amazon.aws.ec2_instance_info:\n    filters:\n      tag:MyTag\n      tag:MyTagValue\n\n- name: Check if tag exists in EC2 instance\n  set_fact:\n    config_template: \"my_template_{{ ec2_instance_tags['MyOtherTag'] }}.j2\"\n  when: ec2_instance_tags | map(attribute='MyTag', default='none') == 'MyTagValue'\n\n- name: Render and save the configuration file using the selected template\n  template:\n    src: templates/{{ config_template }}\n    dest: /path/to/your/config/folder/your-config.yml\n```\n\nThis playbook assumes you have a `MyTag` and `MyOtherTag` defined on your EC2 instances, and `MyTagValue` is the value you want to match.

One strategy that has proven effective is proactively notifying customers about price drops for items they have shown interest in. In this article, we'll guide you on how to use Twilio and TeleSign's SMS API to send bulk SMS alerts when prices for desired products drop.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore we dive into the code, ensure you have the following:\n\n1. An account with Twilio: [Sign up here](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).\n2. A TeleSign SMS API account: [Sign up here](https://www.telesign.com/products/ssf/sign-up).\n3. Node.js installed on your development machine.\n\n## Setting Up Twilio\n\nFirst, we'll set up Twilio to send SMS messages. To do this, you'll need to install the required packages.\n\n```bash\nnpm install twilio twilio-client\n```\n\nNext, initialize the Twilio client and configure it with your account SID, auth token, and client capabilities:\n\n```javascript\nconst twilio = require('twilio');\nconst accountSid = 'ACCOUNT_SID';\nconst authToken = 'AUTH_TOKEN';\n\nconst client = twilio(accountSid, authToken);\n```\n\nReplace `ACCOUNT_SID` and `AUTH_TOKEN` with your Twilio account SID and auth token, respectively.\n\n## Setting Up TeleSign SMS API\n\nTeleSign API uses HTTP requests to send SMS messages. First, create a new project in the TeleSign portal to get your API keys.\n\nNext, install the required package for making HTTP requests:\n\n```bash\nnpm install axios\n```\n\nInitialize the `axios` instance and configure it with your TeleSign API credentials:\n\n```javascript\nconst axios = require('axios');\nconst telsign_customer_id = 'TELESIGN_CUSTOMER_ID';\nconst telsign_api_key = 'TELESIGN_API_KEY';\nconst telsign_user_agent = `Telesign-Node (${package.json.version})`;\n\nconst telesign = axios.create({\n  baseURL: 'https://api.telesign.com/v1/messaging',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',\n    'Authorization': `Basic ${Buffer.from(`${telsign_customer_id}:${telsign_api_key}`).toString('base64')}`,\n    'User-Agent': telsign_user_agent,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nReplace `TELESIGN_CUSTOMER_ID` and `TELESIGN_API_KEY` with your TeleSign customer ID and API key, respectively.\n\n## Sending Price Drop Alerts\n\nWe'll now create a function that sends a price drop alert to customers for products they've shown interest in.\n\n```javascript\nasync function sendPriceDropAlert(phoneNumber, productName, newPrice) {\n  try {\n    await telesign.post(`/v1/message`, {\n      phone_number: phoneNumber,\n      message_body: `Attention! The price of ${productName} has dropped to ${newPrice}$! \ud83d\udcb0 Grab it now! \ud83d\udecd\ufe0f`,\n    });\n\n    console.log(`Sent price drop alert for ${productName} to ${phoneNumber}`);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(`Failed to send price drop alert for ${productName}:`, error);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Triggering Price Drop Alerts\n\nFinally, let's create a script that checks product prices and sends alerts for products with price drops to customers in the `cart_events` table:\n\n```javascript\n// Assuming you have a database connection and a method to fetch cart_events\n// and product prices\n\nconst checkForPriceDrops = async () => {\n  const cartEvents = await fetchCartEvents(); // Replace with your method to fetch cart_events\n\n  for (const cartEvent of cartEvents) {\n    const { phone_number, product_name, product_price } = cartEvent;\n\n    // Assume you have a method to fetch the current price of a product\n    const currentProductPrice = await fetchProductPrice(product_name);\n\n    if (currentProductPrice < product_price) {\n      sendPriceDropAlert(phone_number, product_name, currentProductPrice);\n    }\n  }\n};\n\ncheckForPriceDrops(); // Start checking for price drops\n```\n\nSet up a cron job or schedule your script to run periodically to keep customers informed about price drops.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy leveraging Twilio and TeleSign SMS APIs, you can enhance your ecommerce site by sending timely price drop alerts to customers. This not only helps to increase sales but also fosters customer satisfaction.

Templates allow you to write code that can handle different data types or specific properties of a data type, without having to write separate functions or classes for each data type. This makes the code more reusable and efficient.\n\nFor example, in C++, a template can be used to create functions or classes that can operate on any data type, such as an array or a linked list. The template parameters are replaced with the specific data type at compile time, resulting in specialized code for that specific data type.\n\nHere's an example of a template function that finds the maximum value in an array:\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <typename T>\nT max(T arr[], size_t size) {\n    T maxValue = arr[0];\n    for (size_t i = 1; i < size; i++) {\n        if (arr[i] > maxValue) {\n            maxValue = arr[i];\n        }\n    }\n    return maxValue;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the T is a placeholder for any data type the function can work with. When you use this function, you would specify the concrete data type as the argument. For example:\n\n```cpp\nint myNumbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\ndouble myFloats[] = {1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5};\nint maxInt = max(myNumbers, 5);\ndouble maxFloat = max(myFloats, 5);\n```\n\nIn this case, max() is a template function that can work with any data type (T), and at compile time, the code for int or double versions of the function is generated according to the specific arguments passed.", "shortest_response": "In programming, a template is a construction or set of code that can be reused with different data types or settings, typically achieved by parameterizing the code. This means that instead of having multiple versions of the same code for different types (like int, double, char, etc.), a template allows for the creation of generic code that can work with many types. Common examples of template usage are in C++, where a function or class can be defined as a template to accept various data types as parameters, thus providing flexibility in code reuse and reducing redundancy.", "input_size": 10, "output_sizes": [442, 197, 425, 349, 302, 188, 306, 211, 226, 116], "output_mean": 276.2, "output_std": 101.47, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 200.5, "p50": 264.0, "p75": 338.25, "p99": 440.47}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 9.53903}, {"sample_id": "167d6636a4b00cf1", "prompt_id": "abeb2cb8defcd136", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "Compare and contrast different database management systems and their applications in organizations.Answer in 15 m Style.Long Form Answer.

Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)**\n\n- **Definition**: Organizes data into a structured format of tables, known as schemes. Each table is made up of rows (records) and columns (fields or attributes).\n\n- **Examples**: Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL.\n\n- **Strengths**:\n   - **Data Integrity**: RDBMS allows for a strong data consistency and integrity as tables adhere to pre-defined schema.\n   - **Easy Querying**: SQL (Structured Query Language) makes querying and manipulating data straightforward.\n   - **Scalability**: RDBMS can efficiently handle large quantities of data and provide robust performance under heavy loads.\n\n- **Weaknesses**:\n   - **Complexity**: Initial setup and schema design can be time-consuming and require technical expertise.\n   - **Performance**: Query performance degrades as the amount of data increases without proper indexing and tuning.\n\n- **Application**: Ideal for complex business applications, large-scale websites, and enterprise-level projects.\n\n**2. NoSQL Database Management Systems**\n\n- **Definition**: Non-relational database management systems that manage structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data using a diverse set of data models.\n\n- **Examples**: MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB.\n\n- **Strengths**:\n   - **Flexibility**: No fixed schema allows easier storage of dynamic and inconsistent data.\n   - **Scalability**: NoSQL databases often scale horizontally, making it easier to distribute and handle large amounts of data.\n   - **Performance**: NoSQL databases can provide increased speed by avoiding complex joins or transactions.\n\n- **Weaknesses**:\n   - **Data Integrity**: The absence of a fixed schema may result in inconsistent and loosely structured data, affecting data integrity.\n   - **Ease of Use**: While many NoSQL databases are easy to learn due to their simpler structure, they may lack the robust features offered by RDBMS.\n\n- **Application**: Ideal for managing large volumes of semi-structured and unstructured data, such as user-generated content, IoT data, or big data analytics.\n\n**3. In-Memory Database Management Systems (IMDBMS)**\n\n- **Definition**: Database management systems that store data in computer memory instead of traditional storage devices to achieve faster data access and processing times.\n\n- **Examples**: SAP HANA, TimesTen, Oracle In-Memory Database.\n\n- **Strengths**:\n   - **Speed**: IMDBMSs provide rapid data processing and real-time analytics due to reduced I/O operations and memory-based data access.\n   - **In-memory Analytics**: Real-time data analysis, reporting, and decision-making based on in-memory data without the need for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.\n   - **Reduced Footprint**: IMDBMSs require less physical storage space compared to traditional databases.\n\n- **Weaknesses**:\n   - **Cost**: The high cost of RAM and memory requirements make it expensive to implement in organizations with limited resources.\n   - **Limited Data**: In-memory databases can only store a fraction of the data that traditional databases can store, limiting their capacity.\n\n- **Application**: Ideal for operational business situations where fast response times are critical, such as real-time reporting, financial simulations, or risk analysis.\n\n**4. Cloud-Based Database Management Systems**\n\n- **Definition**: DBMS hosted on cloud infrastructure and managed by third-party providers, eliminating the need for on-premises hardware and maintenance.\n\n- **Examples**: Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Microsoft Azure SQL Database, Amazon DynamoDB, MongoDB Atlas.\n\n- **Strengths**:\n   - **Scalability**: Cloud databases can easily scale up or down based on demand, with minimal impact on performance.\n   - **Reduced Costs**: Eliminating the need for on-premises hardware, maintenance, and IT staff can result in significant cost savings.\n   - **Disaster Recovery**: Robust data backup and recovery mechanisms are often included in cloud-based solutions.\n\n- **Weaknesses**:\n   - **Security**: Sensitive data may be at risk due to shared infrastructure and potential data breaches.\n   - **Dependency**: Organizations may experience limited control and dependence on service providers for performance optimization, data security, and disaster recovery.\n\n- **Application**: Ideal for organizations seeking lower capital expenditure, improved scalability, and flexible deployment options.\n\n**Choosing the Right DBMS**\n\nSelecting the right DBMS depends on factors such as the nature of the data, application requirements, scalability, performance, cost, and organizational needs. Organizations must weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each DBMS to ensure they choose the best solution for their specific business needs.", "shortest_response": "**Heading 1: Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)**\n\nRDBMS stores data in the form of tables with structured relationships, which provides a powerful tool for managing large amounts of data. Examples include Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n\n**Applications**: RDBMS are widely used in businesses for applications like accounting, inventory management, e-commerce, and customer relationship management (CRM). They are also used in human resources management (HRM) systems for employee data storage and analysis.\n\n**Heading 2: Object-Oriented Database Management Systems (OODBMS)**\n\nOODBMS stores data as objects, which have properties, methods, and behaviors. It's more flexible than RDBMS, as it can handle complex data structures and relationships, but it's also more complex to manage and slower. Examples include IBM's ObjectDatabase, and Oracle's Object-Relational Database.\n\n**Applications**: OODBMS are suitable for applications that deal with complex, interrelated data structures such as CAD/CAM systems, scientific simulations, and artificial intelligence systems. However, their use in businesses is limited due to complexity and performance issues.\n\n**Heading 3: NoSQL Database Management Systems**\n\nNoSQL DBMS are non-relational and they are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured data. They can be classified into Key-Value Stores (like Riak and Redis), Document Stores (like MongoDB and CouchDB), Column-Oriented Stores (like Cassandra and HBase), and Graph Databases (like Neo4j and OrientDB).\n\n**Applications**: NoSQL databases are used in big data processing, real-time web applications, such as social networks, content management systems, and IoT applications where the data structure is dynamic and unstructured.\n\n**Heading 4: SQL vs NoSQL**\n\nSQL databases are rigid in structure, ACID compliant, and they provide powerful querying capabilities but struggle with handling large amounts of unstructured data. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are flexible, able to handle unstructured data, and are built for horizontal scalability, but they lack ACID compliance and powerful querying capabilities.\n\n**Applications**: SQL databases are ideal for transaction-heavy applications with highly structured data, such as financial systems or complex analytics. NoSQL databases are best suited for modern web applications, big data processing, and real-time data processing.\n\n**Heading 5: Conclusion**\n\nThe choice of a database management system depends on the specific needs of the organization, including the type and structure of data, scalability requirements, and the nature of the applications. IT managers should consider these factors when selecting a database system.", "input_size": 46, "output_sizes": [760, 1138, 1111, 786, 809, 606, 1074, 809, 648, 822], "output_mean": 856.3, "output_std": 178.19, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 766.5, "p50": 809.0, "p75": 1011.0, "p99": 1135.57}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 29.72431}, {"sample_id": "09b715ac90c78b4a", "prompt_id": "063493057ed3f667", "model": "mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3", "dataset": "ShareGPT", "prompt_text": "I want to generate Prompt for AI painting creation.
