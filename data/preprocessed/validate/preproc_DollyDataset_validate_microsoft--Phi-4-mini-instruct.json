It allows users to perform various operations, such as data insertion, modification, and retrieval from a database. SQL is designed to be easy to learn and understand, and its syntax is widely adopted across different database management systems.\n\nHere are some key features of SQL:\n\n1. Syntax: SQL provides a concise and easy-to-understand syntax for performing database operations.\n\n2. Data Retrieval: SQL is used to retrieve data from databases using various commands like SELECT, which specifies the columns to display and the conditions for filtering results.\n\n3. Data Manipulation: SQL allows users to insert, update, or delete data from tables using commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.\n\n4. Data Definition: SQL is used to define and modify the structure of a database using commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.\n\n5. Integrity and Transactions: SQL provides mechanisms to enforce data integrity and support transactions, ensuring that changes made to a database are consistent and recoverable.\n\n6. Joins and Union: SQL supports complex queries by joining tables and combining results from multiple queries using the JOINS and UNION clauses.\n\n7. Set-based Operations: SQL is highly optimized for performing set-based operations, allowing users to operate on multiple rows or records at once.\n\nTo illustrate SQL query usage, let's consider an example:\n\nAssume we have a table named \"customers\" with the following structure:\n\n```\n+-------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------+\n| customer_id | customer_name| customer_age    | customer_address |\n+-------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------+\n|        1    | John Doe     |           35    | 123 Main St |\n|        2    | Jane Smith   |           28    | 456 Oak Ave |\n|        3    | Sam Brown    |           43    | 789 Pine St |\n+-------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------+\n```\n\nNow, let's say we want to retrieve the customer names and their ages. The corresponding SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT customer_name, customer_age\nFROM customers;\n```\n\nExecuting this query would return the following result:\n\n```\n+---------------------+-------------+\n| customer_name       | customer_age |\n+---------------------+-------------+\n| John Doe            |          35 |\n| Jane Smith          |          28 |\n| Sam Brown           |          43 |\n+---------------------+-------------+\n```\n\nIn this example, the SELECT statement specifies the columns (customer_name and customer_age) to be displayed, and the FROM clause identifies the table (customers) from which to retrieve the data. The result set contains the filtered rows, matching the query criteria. SQL queries are fundamental to interacting with relational databases and form the backbone of data management in many applications.", "shortest_response": "A SQL query is a specific instruction given to a database management system (DBMS) for retrieving, inserting, updating, and deleting data from the database. The most commonly known SQL queries are:\n\n1. SELECT: Used to retrieve data from a database.\n2. INSERT: Used to insert new data into a database.\n3. UPDATE: Used to change existing data in a table.\n4. DELETE: Used to delete data from a table.\n\nA typical SQL query might look something like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT first_name, last_name\nFROM Employees\nWHERE department = 'Sales';\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the `first_name` and `last_name` of employees who work in the 'Sales' department.\n\nSQL is a standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases and is used in conjunction with database engines such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.", "input_size": 9, "output_sizes": [398, 577, 374, 179, 252, 401, 563, 342, 235, 348], "output_mean": 366.9, "output_std": 123.15, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 274.5, "p50": 361.0, "p75": 400.25, "p99": 575.74}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "open_qa", "gen_time": 11.63406}, {"sample_id": "2124f47df11dcbbb", "prompt_id": "fe8bbefe47fb6eca", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Categorize these movies that came out in 1999 as cartoons or live-action: The Matrix, Stuart Little, Cruel Intentions, The Iron Giant, The Blair Witch Project, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, The Sixth Sense", "longest_response": "Here is the categorization of the movies listed based on whether they are cartoons or live-action:\n\nCarboons:\n1.

By focusing on the present moment and disregarding daily worries, meditation helps to calm the mind and reduce the production of stress hormones like cortisol.\n\n2. **Alters Brain Function**: Research using neuroimaging has shown that meditation physically changes the structure and function of the brain. It increases the thickness of the prefrontal cortex (associated with higher-order brain functions, such as awareness, concentration, and decision-making) and the hippocampus (implicated in learning and memory) while decreasing the size of the amygdala, the brain\u2019s \"fear center.\"\n\n3. **Enhances Emotional Well-being**: Meditation practices can lead to an increased sense of self-awareness and greater mindfulness, which can result in a more positive outlook on life. It encourages individuals to develop a non-judgmental attitude towards their thoughts and feelings, reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n\n4. **Improves Concentration and Attention**: By practicing mindfulness meditation, individuals train their brains to focus on the present moment without getting distracted by external or internal noise. This can lead to improved attention span and concentration, which are crucial for effective functioning in daily life.\n\n5. **Promotes Self-awareness**: Meditation helps individuals become more aware of their thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations. This heightened self-awareness can aid in personal growth and development, allowing individuals to have a better understanding of themselves and their mental patterns.\n\n6. **Aids in Managing Pain**: Meditation can have a powerful effect on pain management by promoting relaxation and reducing the perception of pain. It can decrease pain by changing the body\u2019s response to pain and by helping individuals develop greater tolerance to discomfort.\n\n7. **Encourages Healthy Sleep Patterns**: Meditation, particularly mindfulness and body scan techniques, can improve sleep quality by relaxing the body and mind, promoting a calm state conducive to sleep. Better sleep can, in turn, have a significant positive impact on overall mental health.\n\nMeditation is not a cure-all and may not be suitable for everyone, especially those experiencing severe mental health issues. However, it is a valuable tool that, when practiced regularly, can contribute to a healthier and more balanced mental state.

Improving mood: Meditation can also improve mood by increasing the production of positive neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin. This can help to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n\n3. Enhancing attention and focus: Meditation improves attention and focus by training the mind to remain present and disengage from distractions. This can be helpful for those experiencing attention-related disorders, such as ADHD, as well as those who simply want to improve their productivity.\n\n4. Promoting self-awareness: Meditation allows individuals to gain greater insight into their thoughts, emotions, and patterns of behavior.

With over two billion users, Instagram is undoubtedly one of the most popular social media platforms out there. However, as appealing as it may seem from the outside, I've realized it has a less glamorous impact on society\u2014an impact that leads me to permanently discontinue my membership.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through a few points:\n\n**Superficial Validation**\n\nAt its core, Instagram thrives on the superficial validation of \u201clikes\u201d and \u201cfollows.\u201d Many people have told me that they feel immense pressure to post only the best parts of their lives, creating an artificial and often dishonest representation of reality. This pressure ultimately affects mental health, as individuals compare themselves to what they see, leading to lowered self-confidence and exacerbated feelings of inadequacy.\n\n**The Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)**\n\nInstagram perpetuates the Fear of Missing Out, a cultural phenomenon that drives people to incessantly refresh their feeds, hoping to catch the latest trend or event. FOMO not only drains our time but also perpetuates a cycle of dissatisfaction, as it becomes clear that everyone's life, especially those curated on Instagram, seems overwhelmingly better. This unrealistic portrayal discourages contentment with one\u2019s own circumstances.\n\n**Erosion of Privacy and Trust**\n\nTrust is a cornerstone of any healthy relationship, and Instagram does not prioritize this with the way personal information is shared and perceived. User privacy often takes a back seat as people overshare details of their lives, exposing themselves not only to possible cyber threats but also to judgment from the faceless audience.\n\n**Impact on Youth and Mental Health**\n\nInstagram's influence on younger generations is particularly concerning. The platform bombards young people with idealized images of beauty, wealth, and happiness. This bombardment skews their perceptions and aspirations, leading to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction with their physical and personal lives. Studies have correlated high Instagram use with increased rates of anxiety, depression, and body image issues among teens and young adults.\n\n**Misinformation and Fake News**\n\nSocial media platforms, including Instagram, have become hotbeds for misinformation and fake news. This phenomenon is not new, but Instagram\u2014the visual and fleeting nature of its content\u2014makes it particularly ripe for viral misinformation. The lack of fact-checking and immediate corrections exacerbates the problem, fostering an environment where false narratives can rapidly spread and take hold.\n\n**The Culture of Comparison**\n\nInstagram fosters a culture of constant comparison. Users meticulously curate their online personas, often showcasing moments of privilege or success others may feel they lack. This culture breeds competition and jealousy, undermining communal harmony and making it difficult for genuine bonds to form.\n\n**Unsustainable Consumption Habits**\n\nInstagram has also popularized fast fashion, influencer marketing, and consumerism. The emphasis on visual content and lifestyle branding pushes people to engage in unsustainable consumption behaviors to keep up with trends showcased by influencers. These practices have detrimental effects on the environment, contributing to overproduction and waste.\n\n**Why Leaving is the Best Move for Me**\n\nDeciding to delete my Instagram account was not an easy one, but it felt right after a moment of introspection. I realize that I've been chasing likes and validation instead of focusing on my own well-being. I want to reclaim my time and mental space from the pressures of social media, engage with the world in more authentic and meaningful ways, and step away from the cycle of comparison that has been so pervasive.\n\nIn my absence, I encourage you to evaluate your relationship with Instagram\u2014or any social platform, for that matter. Are you spending too much time curating an image versus cultivating real connections? Are you chasing validation at the expense of your self-worth? These are questions worth pondering. Remember, it\u2019s our mental, emotional, and social well-being that matter most.\n\nUntil next time,\n[Your Name]", "shortest_response": "I\u2019m sorry, but I have to decline this request.

It was developed by statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini.\nThe Gini coefficient measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution, such as levels of income. A Gini coefficient of 0 reflects perfect equality, where all income or wealth values are the same, while a Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) reflects maximal inequality among values. For example, if everyone has the same income, the Gini coefficient will be 0. In contrast, a Gini coefficient of 1 indicates that within a group of people, a single individual has all the income or consumption, while all others have none.\nThe Gini coefficient was proposed by Corrado Gini as a measure of inequality of income or wealth.  For OECD countries, in the late 20th century, considering the effect of taxes and transfer payments, the income Gini coefficient ranged between 0.24 and 0.49, with Slovenia being the lowest and Mexico the highest.

The main components of Apache Kafka include:\n\n1. **Kafka Broker**: The essential piece of Kafka's system, the Kafka Broker is a distributed and highly available server that processes read, store, and replicate streams of records and topics. The Kafka Broker plays a central role in ensuring data is distributed and managed across a cluster to provide fault tolerance and scalability.\n\n2. **Cluster**: A Kafka cluster is a collection of Kafka brokers. A minimum one Kafka broker is required. Kafka brokers run on Linux and Windows boxes, and they can run on standard hardware (e.g., PC), on bare metal, or in highly available configurations using high-availability networking components (e.g., load balancers, multiple firewalls).\n\n3. **Producer**: Producers are clients that publish a stream of records into Kafka. Each Producer can send messages to one or more Kafka topics concurrently. It is the source of records in the Kafka ecosystem. Producers must serialise records before sending them to Kafka.\n\n4. **Consumer**: Consumers run in a client application that requests records from one or more Kafka topics. Kafka clients use the Confluent-developed librdkafka C library's API to work with the Kafka protocol.\n\n5. **Kafka Topic**: A Kafka topic is a categories (or partitions) into which records are grouped before storing on disk. A single Kafka broker can be assigned a fixed number of partitions per topic, and a single topic can have zero or more partitions. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records (as defined by the producer).\n\n6. **Partition**: Each Kafka topic is divided into partitions. Partitions allow for a scalable and distributed model, as multiple producers can write to and consume from the same partitions in parallel. This enables Kafka to handle a larger overall flow of data in a distributed framework than might otherwise be possible.\n\n7. **ZooKeeper**: Kafka uses Apache ZooKeeper, a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. While Kafka can run without ZooKeeper, using it adds a layer of reliability and robustness by ensuring that only one of the Kafka brokers knows the other brokers' locations as well as the state of the Kafka cluster.\n\n8. **Schema Registry**: Apache Avro schema registry is an auxiliary service for storing schemas needed for serialization and deserialization of schemas. It supports JSON, Protobuf, ORC, and Thrift formats, allowing users to send and store data in a unified and serialized format. While not strictly a Kafka component, it is often associated with Kafka for use in microservice architectures.\n\n9. **Kafka Streams**: A Java API for building applications and microservices that process and analyze data stored in Kafka. Similar to Kafka, but built specifically for building applications and performing stream processing on top of Kafka streams data. It allows developers to run stateful computations over streams of records in Kafka.\n\n10. **Connect**: Apache Kafka Connect is a framework for connecting Kafka with external systems such as databases, key-value stores, and event streaming platforms, in a near real-time or fully real-time fashion. It allows Kafka to be used as a messaging hub, distributing data in and out of Kafka.\n\nThese components work together to create a powerful platform for real-time data streaming, ensuring that data can be captured, processed, stored, and accessed effectively across distributed systems.", "shortest_response": "The main components of Apache Kafka include Publishers, Consumers, Topics, Partitions, and Brokers.\n\nPublishers are responsible for creating and sending records to a Kafka cluster. Publishers can either be a Kafka client or a broker, depending on the scenario. Brokers are responsible for storing and distributing data to other brokers and clients.\n\nConsumers are clients that subscribe to topics in a Kafka cluster to receive records. They can be local and remote, depending on the desired deployment scenario. In Kafka, consumers can be connected to a single broker or a partition to receive messages from topic partitions.\n\nTopics are Kafka data structures that hold the messages from one or more publishers, and they are logically separated to enable organizations to add or remove partitions for scalability and fault-tolerance. Topics can have a large number of partitions, which in turn, can have hundreds or thousands of replicas to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.\n\nPartitions enable parallelism and scalability in Kafka, and Kafka can scale a topic by increasing the number of partitions.\n\nLastly, a Kafka cluster consists of one or more brokers, each with a copy of the metadata used to control the operation of Kafka, including topics, partitions, and brokers. All Kafka commands and APIs interact with the broker's local cluster metadata; all other clients, brokers, and topics are also kept synchronized. In a Kafka cluster, all messages published to a topic are always directed to the partition with the lowest ID. When a newly published message comes to the Kafka broker, it is distributed to its own designated partition, ensuring that messages are processed in order from that topic. There can be many different partitioned topics in a single Kafka cluster, with multiple configurations for replication and high availability.", "input_size": 12, "output_sizes": [367, 656, 702, 615, 498, 634, 604, 423, 338, 576], "output_mean": 541.3, "output_std": 120.72, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 441.75, "p50": 590.0, "p75": 629.25, "p99": 697.86}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 14.12683}, {"sample_id": "43fbb43d68b62015", "prompt_id": "5466d461664a4d58", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "From the passage provided, extract the year Pro Kabaddi League was established.\nContext: Asian Games\nMain article: Kabaddi at the Asian Games\n(video) Kabaddi being played in Japan, 2015\nKabaddi was played as a demonstration event at the First Asian Games in 1951, and again in 1982, before becoming a medal event for the first time in 1990.\n\nThe Indian national team won every men's and women's kabaddi competition in the Asian Games from 2002 through 2014.

Such goals may not actually reflect what human designers intend, such as by failing to take into account any human values not included in the goals. If an AI developed according to the standard model were to become superintelligent, it would likely not fully reflect human values and could be catastrophic to humanity. Russell asserts that precisely because the timeline for developing human-level or superintelligent AI is highly uncertain, safety research should be begun as soon as possible, as it is also highly uncertain how long it would take to complete such research.\n\nRussell argues that continuing progress in AI capability is inevitable because of economic pressures. Such pressures can already be seen in the development of existing AI technologies such as self-driving cars and personal assistant software. Moreover, human-level AI could be worth many trillions of dollars. Russell then examines the current debate surrounding AI risk. He offers refutations to a number of common arguments dismissing AI risk and attributes much of their persistence to tribalism\u2014AI researchers may see AI risk concerns as an \"attack\" on their field. Russell reiterates that there are legitimate reasons to take AI risk concerns seriously and that economic pressures make continued innovation in AI inevitable.\n\nRussell then proposes an approach to developing provably beneficial machines that focuses on deference to humans. Unlike in the standard model of AI, where the objective is rigid and certain, this approach would have the AI's true objective remain uncertain, with the AI only approaching certainty about it as it gains more information about humans and the world. This uncertainty would, ideally, prevent catastrophic misunderstandings of human preferences and encourage cooperation and communication with humans. Russell concludes by calling for tighter governance of AI research and development as well as cultural introspection about the appropriate amount of autonomy to retain in an AI-dominated world.", "longest_response": "Stuart Russell's proposal to overcome the limitations of the standard approach for developing AI is to shift the focus towards creating machines with the primary goal of being \"human compatible.\" This approach emphasizes that AI systems should be designed to infer and respect human values and goals, even when they are not explicitly programmed. Instead of rigidly aiming to meet predetermined human-specified goals, the objective would be uncertain, with the AI gradually refining its understanding of what would truly benefit humans based on continuous interaction and learning.\n\nKey elements of Russell's proposal include:\n\n1. **Deference to Humans:** The AI system should prioritize understanding and aligning with human intentions, values, and preferences, particularly those that are not easily articulated. The true objective of the AI remains uncertain, fostering cooperation and communication.\n\n2. **Human-Centered Objectives:** The AI should focus on achieving goals that genuinely reflect human well-being, rather than just accomplishing specific tasks assigned by humans, which might miss broader values.\n\n3. **Incremental Knowledge and Adaptation:** By keeping the objectives uncertain and refining them over time, the AI can avoid catastrophic misunderstandings and develop in a way that is supportive of human values.\n\n4. **Promoting Safety:** Russell emphasizes the importance of safety research and cautious development, given the unpredictable timeline for creating advanced AI and the potential catastrophic risks if the standard model continues without modifications.\n\n5. **Governance and Oversight:** Russell advocates for tighter governance of AI R&D to ensure responsible development and introspection about the extent of autonomy AI systems should have in society.\n\nOverall, Russell's proposal aims to prevent the creation of AI systems that could act against human interests and encourages the development of algorithms and machines that are safe, aligned with human values, and capable of fostering positive human outcomes.", "shortest_response": "Stuart Russell proposes an approach to developing AI that focuses on deference to humans, where the AI's true objective remains uncertain, with the AI approaching certainty about it as it gains more information about humans and the world.

One scenario where CEPI sees immense value is the early detection and response to a new, rapidly spreading viral outbreak resulting from zoonotic disease transmission\u2014an infectious disease that can be transmitted to humans from animals.\n\nIn this hypothetical scenario, CEPI plays a pivotal role in the following ways:\n\n### 1. Vaccine Development and Collaboration\n- **Rapid Vaccine Design**: CEPI collaborates with pharmaceutical companies, global health stakeholders, and research institutions to develop a targeted vaccine for the new virus relatively faster than typical vaccine development timelines. By leveraging pre-existing platforms and innovative approaches like mRNA vaccine technology, they can expedite the vaccine design process.\n\n### 2. Global Coordination and Fund Allocation\n- **Financial Support and Procurement**: CEPI provides financial support and coordinates with governments, international agencies (like WHO and GAVI), and philanthropic organizations to pool resources and secure vaccine supplies. This ensures that the available vaccines are distributed equitably among nations, prioritizing healthcare workers, high-risk populations, and global hotspots.\n\n### 3. Monitoring and Surveillance\n- **Disease Tracking and Early Warning Systems**: CEPI supports a global network of surveillance systems that continuously monitor the spread of the disease, collecting data on the virus's transmission, geographical spread, and mutation patterns. This enables timely updates to vaccine formulations to address any variations in the virus.\n\n### 4. Regulatory and Ethical Frameworks\n- **Regulatory Accelerations**: In collaboration with regulatory bodies, CEPI advocates for streamlined regulatory pathways for emergency use authorization of vaccines while ensuring safety and efficacy. This allows for quicker deployment in the face of a public health crisis.\n\n### 5. Public Communication and Education\n- **Communication and Awareness Campaigns**: CEPI works on public education campaigns to raise awareness about the benefits of vaccination, dispel myths, and build community trust in vaccine initiatives. This helps in achieving high vaccine uptake rates, which is crucial for herd immunity.\n\n### Scenario Illustration\nA scenario fitting these criteria could look like this:\n\n#### Initial Detection and Response\n- CEPI is alerted by WHO about an emerging zoonotic virus identified in bats. Preliminary data suggests high human-to-human transmission. Rapid genomic sequencing identifies the virus's structure, aiding in the initial vaccine design process.\n\n#### Vaccine Development and Clinical Trials\n- Under CEPI's coordination, pharmaceutical companies and research institutions around the world collaborate to develop a vaccine. Drawing on pre-existing mRNA platforms, they produce candidate vaccine prototypes within a year, much faster than historical records.\n\n#### Distribution and Immunization\n- CEPI mobilizes global funding and logistical support, ensuring rapid production and equitable distribution. Healthcare providers are given immediate access to the vaccines. Major campaigns begin, targeting vulnerable populations worldwide.\n\n#### Monitoring and Adaptations\n- Global surveillance networks, funded by CEPI, track vaccine efficacy, coverage, and any viral mutations. Adjustments are made to vaccine formulations where needed, and booster shots are prepared.\n\n#### Long-term Preparedness\n- Lessons learned are utilized to strengthen global health preparedness plans. CEPI invests in enhancing surveillance systems and ensuring that rapid response mechanisms are in place for future outbreaks.\n\nBy addressing the various facets of pandemic preparedness and response\u2014including funding, development, coordination, and communication\u2014CEPI plays a crucial role in reducing the impact of the outbreak, saving millions of lives, and ultimately bringing the pandemic under control.", "shortest_response": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is an important public health organization that plays a critical role in controlling and preventing diseases and health threats, both domestically and internationally.

Here are some key distinctions:\n\n1. **Power Source:**\n   - **Bike:** Traditional bicycles rely entirely on human-powered energy from pedaling by the rider.\n   - **Electric Bike (e-bike):** These bikes have a motor that provides auxiliary power to assist riding, making pedaling less strenuous.\n\n2. **Performance:**\n   - **Bike:** Dependent on the rider\u2019s physical strength and endurance.\n   - **Electric Bike:** The motor offers instant torque, allowing for easier uphill climbs and sustained high speeds without the same level of physical exertion.\n\n3. **Regulations:**\n   - **Bike:** Not subject to specific safety regulations for electric assist.\n   - **Electric Bike:** In many jurisdictions, e-bikes may be classified differently than standard bicycles, often subjecting them to specific testing and safety standards for the electric motor and batteries.\n\n4. **Range:**\n   - **Bike:** Generally, bikes do not have a range limit other than the rider\u2019s capacity to pedal.\n   - **Electric Bike:** These bikes have a limited range (typically 20-60 miles) before the battery needs recharging.\n\n5. **Maintenance:**\n   - **Bike:** Consists mainly of manual labor for maintenance (chain oiling, tire pressure checks, etc.).\n   - **Electric Bike:** Requires additional maintenance for the motor, battery, and charging system, such as checking the battery charge level and ensuring the motor is functioning properly.\n\n6. **Top Speed:**\n   - **Bike:** Limited by the rider's physical capabilities and can typically reach top speeds of about 20-40 mph.\n   - **Electric Bike:** The top speed can range up to 28-35 mph, depending on the type and power of the motor and battery.\n\n**Types of Electric Bikes:**\n- **Pedal Assist E-Bikes (PA-EBs):** Provide assistance on-demand when pedaled.\n- **Throttle-Assist E-Bikes (TA-EBs):** Offer additional power when the throttle is engaged while riding.\n- **Kick-Assist E-Bikes (KA-EBs):** Utilize knee pressure to trigger the motor, often used by individuals with limited leg strength.\n\n**Legal and Functional Differences:**\nDifferent areas may have varying definitions and regulations for electric bikes. In some countries, regulations might restrict the power output or motor assist capabilities to define what qualifies as an electric bike versus an electric personal assist device (EPAD).\n\nIn summary, the distinction between bikes and electric bikes is primarily centered on the assistance provided by an electric motor, impacting performance, maintenance, and regulations.", "shortest_response": "Bikes are powered solely by the energy exerted by the rider, typically through pedaling, while electric bikes (e-bikes) use a combination of human and electric power to help push the bike. E-bikes typically have pedal-assist motors or throttle systems that can vary in power output, allowing for a more extended range and less effort per pedal stroke compared to regular bikes. The main advantages of e-bikes over regular bikes include increased speed, less physical strain, and the ability to reach destinations that might otherwise be too difficult to cycle to. However, they also may have restrictions, such as speed limits on roads, depending on the legal definitions of bikes in different regions. E-bikes tend to be more expensive and may require recharging, which can impact convenience. Regular bikes, on the other hand, require no electricity, have minimal maintenance as they do not have electronic components (apart from the chain, brake pads and so on), and are generally more affordable.

It enables tenants to access new communities, homes, or rental options without having to directly find a new place to live.\n\n5. Time and Effort Savings: Subletting can save tenants time and effort, as they don't need to directly locate and secure a new rental property. By subleasing, they can focus on other important aspects of their life.\n\n6. Potential Savings in Maintenance and Upkeep Costs: If the sublease agreement specifies that the subtenant will assume responsibility for property maintenance and related costs, the landlord or original tenant may save on expenses associated with property upkeep.\n\n7.

Judo emphasizes throws, takedowns, and ground grappling techniques.\n\n2. **Kano Jiu-Jitsu**: In its early stages, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was almost identical to Judo, with the same techniques, throws, and ground fighting. As Gracie brothers refined BJJ, they sought to make it more effective, particularly focusing on self-defense by stressing ground fighting and submissions.\n\n3. **Catch Wrestling**: Carlos Gracie was initially exposed to catch wrestling during his time in England and Italy and incorporated elements such as single and double leg takedowns, leg locks, and ground control into his adaptation of Judo. Catch wrestling, known for its strikingly aggressive ground play and submission grappling, added to the technique repertoire of BJJ.\n\n4. **Karate**: H\u00e9lio Gracie, inspired by his father's interests in varied martial arts, studied other styles including Karate, particularly focusing on techniques involving the striking elements of the sport (punches, kicks, palm strikes). This influence contributed to the development of striking strategies in BJJ, complementing its grappling techniques.\n\nBrazilian Jiu-Jitsu evolved into a distinct martial art focused on ground fighting, submissions, and minimal reliance on striking.

Learning to skateboard can be a fun and exhilarating process, but it can also be challenging. Here are two different methods to help you learn efficiently and safely:\n\n### Method 1: Traditional In-Person Classes\n\n**1. Find the Right Class:**\n   - Look for reputable skate schools, community centers, or local skate shops that offer beginner classes.\n   - Check out their reviews and experiences to ensure the quality of the instruction and safety measures.\n\n**2. Gear Up:**\n   - Purchase or borrow essential skateboarding gear, including a skateboard, protective wear (helmet, knee pads, elbow pads, wrist guards), and comfortable shoes.\n\n**3. Join the Class:**\n   - Sign up for a beginner\u2019s class focusing on balance and basic riding techniques.\n   - Attend all classes, even if the pace seems slow. Consistency is key.\n\n**4. Learn the Basics:**\n   - **Mounting:** Learn how to stand on the skateboard and push off with your back foot, then place your front foot on the board to balance.\n   - **Stance:** Practice a comfortable stance and find the \u201cstance width\u201d that feels right for you.\n   - **Popping the Tail:** Learn to balance and propel yourself by popping the tail of the skateboard slightly.\n   - **Rolling Forward:** Start rolling forward, focusing on maintaining balance and using your feet to steer.\n\n**5. Practice, Practice, Practice:**\n   - Spend time practicing at your own pace, both indoors (like in a skate park or gym) and outdoors (in a quiet, flat area).\n   - Ask your teacher for tips and corrections to improve your technique.\n\n**6. Progress to Intermediate Classes:**\n   - Once comfortable, enroll in intermediate classes to learn new tricks and skills.\n\n### Method 2: Online Tutorials and Private Lessons\n\n**1. Choose the Right Resources:**\n   - Research and select high-quality, instructional videos from reputable skateboarders and tutorial sources like YouTube, online skate shops, or specialized websites.\n\n**2. Gather Supplies:**\n   - Assemble your skateboard, protective gear, and any additional items necessary like a ramp or skate park.\n\n**3. Start with Basics (Video Only):**\n   - Begin learning the fundamental skills such as mounting, standing, leaning, and first steps rolling through video tutorials.\n   - Focus on understanding the basics thoroughly before moving on to more complex tricks.\n\n**4. Consistent Practice Routine:**\n   - Set aside dedicated time each day to practice. Consistency will lead to improvement over time.\n\n**5. Combine Theory and Practice:**\n   - Alternate between watching videos and physically attempting the moves on your skateboard.\n   - Pay attention to the smaller details like foot positioning, weight distribution, and body alignment.\n\n**6. Seek Feedback:**\n   - Consider asking for feedback from experienced skateboarders in online forums or local communities.\n   - You could also look into hiring a private tutor through platforms that connect learners with skilled instructors. Private lessons can offer personalized guidance.\n\n**7. Self-assess and Self-Correct:**\n   - Record videos of yourself to review your progress and identify areas for improvement.\n   - Correct mistakes and refine your techniques with each practice session.\n\n**8. Progress to Advanced Techniques:**\n   - Gradually move on to more advanced tutorials and real-world practice as your skills improve.\n   - Always wear protective gear before attempting new tricks, especially those that involve greater risk.\n\nBoth methods have their merits: traditional in-person classes provide structured learning and direct feedback from instructors, while online tutorials offer flexibility and the ability to learn at your own pace. Feel free to combine elements of both approaches for a more comprehensive learning experience. Good luck and have fun street skating!", "shortest_response": "Sure, here are two different methods to learn how to skateboard: \n\n1. Traditional Skate School Method: In this approach, an experienced instructor provides direct teaching, breaking down the fundamentals of balance, stance, and foot placement. Learners usually follow a step-by-step process, starting with the beginner's stance, learning to stand on the skateboard, push-off to go forward, and eventually, maneuvering and doing some tricks.\n\n2. Self-Guided Learning Method: This technique encourages learners to learn independently by researching and reading various resources, including articles, videos, or buying skateboard tutorials. They must be self-disciplined and committed to put in the time and effort to practice consistently. This would involve learning about safety measures, the importance of good posture, balancing techniques, and gradually practicing basic skateboarding skills.\n\nBoth methods have their own pros and cons, and some find it a bit more helpful to combine them for maximum learning.

Quartz watches are precision timekeeping devices that function by the piezoelectric property of quartz crystals. When an electric current is applied to a quartz crystal, it oscillates at a very stable and precise frequency. This oscillation is then converted into electrical pulses, which are counted by the watch's electronic circuits to keep accurate time.\n\n\nA mechanical watch, also known as a mechanical watch, is timekeeping watch with moving mechanical parts. The watch's primary components are the movement or mechanism, which typically involves springs, gears, wheels, and an escapement mechanism that oscillates to keep time, which is regulated by the balance wheel and controlled by the escape wheel.\n\n\nTo summarize, the key differences between quartz and mechanical watches are:\n\n\n- **Timekeeping Mechanism**: Quartz watches use an electric oscillator made from quartz crystals, while mechanical watches use a balance wheel and escapement, with the power source being a mainspring that requires winding.\n\n\n- **Precision**: Quartz watches typically offer greater precision, often within \u00b115 seconds per month, whereas mechanical watches generally maintain accuracy within \u00b130 seconds to \u00b140 seconds per month.\n\n\n- **Maintenance and Lifespan**: Quartz watches are low maintenance and can last for decades without much servicing because the quartz crystal is the main timekeeping element. Mechanical watches require more frequent maintenance, including cleaning and oiling, to keep functioning correctly and may last for many years, but they eventually will wear out and often need replacement parts or repair.\n\n\n- **Aesthetics and Mechanics**: Mechanical watches often carry significant mechanical and aesthetic appeal, showcasing the craftsmanship involved in their intricate movements. Quartz watches tend to focus more on the simplicity and functionality of timekeeping.", "shortest_response": "- Quartz watches are powered by a battery and have a quartz crystal that oscillates at a specific frequency when moved by a rotor in the movement. This oscillation is used to keep time extremely accurately.\n- Mechanical watches are powered by a spring or a mainspring that needs to be wound or turned by the user to power the watch movement. Mechanical watches have a series of gears and springs that transfer the power to a regulator, which moves to a balance wheel, creating the watch's \"beat\".\n- Quartz watches are generally more accurate than mechanical ones, while mechanical watches are often seen as more complex and luxurious.\n- Mechanical watches are generally larger and heavier than quartz watches because of all the moving parts.\n\nIn short, the difference between a quartz watch and a mechanical watch is the way they move the hands. Quartz watches use a battery-powered electronic movement, whereas mechanical watches use a movement powered by a spring and involve complex mechanical parts in their operation. Mechanical watches are more prized for their craftsmanship and complexity, while quartz watches are praised for their accuracy and affordability.", "input_size": 15, "output_sizes": [251, 360, 283, 221, 311, 213, 317, 349, 343, 289], "output_mean": 293.7, "output_std": 49.48, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 259.0, "p50": 300.0, "p75": 336.5, "p99": 359.01}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 7.24823}, {"sample_id": "66430730594327f1", "prompt_id": "6afb77af602b67fc", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Give me a list of great sci-fi", "longest_response": "Sure, here is a list of some of the great sci-fi movies and TV shows across various genres:\n\n### Films\n\n1. **\"Blade Runner\" (1982)**\n   - Directed by Ridley Scott, this neo-noir science fiction film is a cornerstone of the genre.\n\n2. **\"The Matrix\" (1999)**\n   - Directed by the Wachowskis, this film explores a dystopian reality where humans are trapped inside a simulated world.\n\n3. **\"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" (1982)**\n   - Directed by Steven Spielberg, this classic follows an alien child and his quest to return to his home planet.\n\n4. **\"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968)**\n   - Directed by Stanley Kubrick, this epic sci-fi film explores the evolution of humanity with stunning visuals and thought-provoking narrative.\n\n5. **\"Inception\" (2010)**\n   - Directed by Christopher Nolan, this film delves into the world of dreams and the manipulation of the subconscious.\n\n6. **\"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\" (1977)**\n   - Directed by George Lucas, this iconic film began a legendary sci-fi saga.\n\n7. **\"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980)**\n   - A sequel to the original Star Wars and one of the most popular films in cinematic history.\n\n8. **\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" (1979)**\n   - Directed by Robert Wise, this film explores the future of space exploration and a unified human race.\n\n9. **\"Back to the Future\" (1985)**\n   - Directed by Robert Zemeckis, this time-traveling science fiction adventure became a cultural phenomenon.\n\n10. **\"The Terminator\" (1984)**\n    - Directed by James Cameron, this film combines elements of science fiction and action horror.\n\n### TV Series\n\n1. **\"Doctor Who\"**\n   - This long-running British sci-fi series follows the adventures of the Doctor, a time-traveling alien, with different companions in different epochs.\n\n2. **\"The Expanse\"**\n   - This series merges space opera and survival drama, depicting political intrigue on a future space colony, Mars, and the Moon.\n\n3. **\"Battlestar Galactica\"**\n   - This series, inspired by the 1978 film, explores a future where humans seek a new home after their fleet is destroyed and an exiled robot civilization helps them.\n\n4. **\"Black Mirror\"**\n   - A British anthology series that delves into dystopian scenarios often featuring a near-future technological world.\n\n5. **\"Star Trek\" (original series)**\n   - Created by Gene Roddenberry, this iconic series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew aboard the USS Enterprise.\n\n6. **\"The X-Files\"**\n   - This series explores paranormal phenomena in a world where the search for truth often blurs with skepticism.\n\n7. **\"Stranger Things\"**\n   - Blending science fiction, horror, and 80s nostalgia, this series focuses on a group of kids dealing with supernatural occurrences in their small town of Hawkins.\n\n8. **\"The Mandalorian\"**\n   - Set in the Star Wars universe, this series follows a lone bounty hunter in the Outer Rim planets of Star Wars.\n\n9. **\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\"**\n   - A sequel to the original series, this shows the adventures of Captain Jean-Luc Picard and his team aboard the USS Enterprise-D.\n\n10. **\"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\"**\n    - This series takes place on a space station located between the Alpha and Beta quadrants, featuring long-form storytelling and complex plots.\n\nThese films and TV shows cover a variety of themes within the sci-fi genre, from dystopian futures and heroic quests to cosmic adventures and introspective narratives.

Stinnett claims the memo suggests only a direct attack on U.S. interests would sway the American public (or Congress) to favor direct involvement in the European war, specifically in support of the British. An attack by Japan would not, could not, aid Britain. Although the memo was passed to Captains Walter Anderson and Dudley Knox, two of Roosevelt's military advisors, on October 7, 1940, there is no evidence to suggest Roosevelt ever saw it, while Stinnett's claims of evidence he did is nonexistent. Moreover, although Anderson and Knox offered eight specific plans to aggrieve the Japanese Empire and added, \"If by these means Japan could be led to commit an overt act of war, so much the better,\" of the eight \"plans\" (actions to be taken) offered in the memo, many if not all were implemented, but there is considerable doubt the McCollum memo was the inspiration.[citation needed] Nonetheless, in Day of Deceit Stinnett claims all action items were implemented. Yet there were numerous instances of members of the Roosevelt Administration insisting on not provoking Japan. Mark Parillo, in his essay The United States in the Pacific, wrote, \"hese theories tend to founder on the logic of the situation. Had Roosevelt and other members of his administration known of the attack in advance, they would have been foolish to sacrifice one of the major instruments needed to win the war just to get the United States into it.\" Furthermore, on 5 November 1941, in a joint memo, Stark, CNO, and Marshall, Army Chief of Staff, warned, \"if Japan be defeated and Germany remain undefeated, decision will still not have been reached.... War between the United States and Japan should be avoided....\" Additionally, in a 21 November 1941 memo, Brigadier Leonard T. Gerow, head of Army War Plans, stated, \"one of our present major objectives  the avoidance of war with Japan...[and to] insure continuance of material assistance to the British.\" He concluded, \"[I]t is of grave importance to our war effort in Europe...\" Furthermore, Churchill himself, in a 15 May 1940 telegram, said he hoped a U.S. commitment to aid Britain would \"quiet\" Japan, following with a 4 October message requesting a USN courtesy visit to Singapore aimed at \"preventing the spreading of the war\" And Stark's own Plan Dog expressly stated, \"Any strength that we might send to the Far East would...reduce the force of our blows against Germany...\" Roosevelt could scarcely have been ignorant of Stark's views, and war with Japan was clearly contrary to Roosevelt's express wish to aid Britain.\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_advance-knowledge_conspiracy_theory", "longest_response": "Robert Stinnett's book \"Day of Deceit\" theorizes that a memorandum from Commander McCollum, which aimed to provoke an overt act of war by Japan, was central to U.S. prewar strategy.

Here are some key factors to consider and strategies that might help in raising a trilingual child:\n\n### Factors to Consider\n\n1. **Age of the Child:** Starting language learning early (as a baby or toddler) generally makes it easier for children to acquire multiple languages fluently. However, it\u2019s never too late to start learning additional languages.\n  \n2. **Family and Social Environment:** A supportive environment, with opportunities to use multiple languages socially and at home, is essential. Having parents or caregivers who are proficient in the languages can be very beneficial.\n  \n3. **Consistency and Immersion:** Regular exposure and use of each language in meaningful contexts will help with language retention and fluidity.\n\n4. **Motivation and Interest:** Children thrive in environments where languages are viewed positively. If they develop positive attitudes toward learning and using different languages, they are more likely to succeed.\n\n### Strategies for Raising a Trilingual Child\n\n1. **Early Language Introduction:**\n   - If possible, introduce the child to all three languages early in life. This can be done through baby signing for languages that have signed forms, using baby books, songs, or simple stories in each language.\n\n2. **Create a Language-Literate Environment:**\n   - Label objects, use signs, and provide simple texts in each language at home and in the child's daily environment. This constant visual and contextual reinforcement will help the child associate words with their meanings.\n\n3. **Modeling and Usage:**\n   - Make sure to speak consistently in each language to the child. Create routines where certain activities or times of day are associated with specific languages (e.g., bedtime stories in one language, meal conversations in another).\n\n4. **Involving Professionals:**\n   - Children\u2019s bilingual or multilingual programs, tutors, or language daycare centers can provide structured learning and social exposure.\n\n5. **Cultural Exposure:**\n   - Expose the child to music, TV shows, books, games, and cultural activities from the countries where the languages are spoken. This not only aids language learning but also nurtures cultural appreciation.\n\n6. **Reinforcing Through Play:**\n   - Engage in play that encourages the use of each language. This could include story-telling, cooking or baking recipes (in your native language), playing with multilingual toys, or interactive apps designed for language learning.\n\n7. **Pragmatic Approach:**\n   - Focus on functional language rather than grammar initially. Learning phrases and sentences that are used in daily life promotes practical communication and builds confidence.\n\n### Example Language Allocation\n\n- Child's First Language (L1): English\n- Second Language (L2): Spanish\n- Third Language (L3): Mandarin or another language of your choice\n\nBy combining these strategies and creating a supportive and engaging language-learning environment, you can help your child become proficient in three languages. Patience, perseverance, and positive reinforcement are key. Success in raising a trilingual child is a rewarding journey that enriches the child's cognitive abilities, cultural awareness, and communication skills.", "shortest_response": "Yes, it is possible to raise your child trilingual. Raising a child to be trilingual involves intentional and consistent efforts. Here are some tips to help you on this journey:\n\n1. **Early Exposure:** Begin exposing your child to multiple languages as early as possible, ideally during the first years of life when language acquisition is most natural. For infants, this means talking to them in all three languages, singing lullabies, and reading books in those languages.\n\n2. **Consistent Practice:** Regularly provide opportunities for your child to use each language in various contexts and activities. This could include storytelling, playtime, chores, and educational activities.\n\n3. **Immersion:** Seek out environments where your child is surrounded by and uses the trilingual languages. This might mean integrating with communities that use those languages or arranging for visits by friends or relatives in neighborhoods where these languages are spoken.\n\n4. **Professional Support:** Consider hiring tutors or enrolling your child in bilingual or trilingual programs, which can provide formal and structured learning opportunities.\n\n5. **Parental Involvement:** Be fluent and actively use each language with your child. Children learn first languages best by interacting with fluent speakers. Consistency from you will inspire your child and build their confidence in using each language.\n\n6. **Balance and Integration:** Ensure that your child doesn't feel overwhelmed by trying to learn three languages simultaneously.

A common characteristic of term deposits is that the account holder agrees to leave the funds untouched for the agreed period. Early withdrawal before the term ends usually results in a penalty, such as loss of some or all of the accrued interest.\n\n\nDeposit accounts are considered liquid assets, meaning they can be quickly and easily converted to cash without significant loss in value or without penalty.

When fewer resources are consumed, the preservation of valuable natural resources, such as minerals or organic materials, is a significant benefit.\n\n5. Maintenance of quality standards: When you repair an item rather than replace it, there is less likelihood of subpar quality standards being met with cheaper, counterfeit, or inferior replacements. Repairing usually involves repairing the item to original standards or better, thereby ensuring the optimal performance and durability of the product for a longer period before replacement is warranted. \n\nIn conclusion, going for a repair rather than replacing an item can help save money, support environmental sustainability, prevent additional waste, preserve resources, and maintain quality standards for better products.

Here are some tips to help you capture stunning star images:\n\n1. **Choose the Right Equipment:**\n   - **Camera:** A DSLR or mirrorless camera with manual settings works best. Lenses with larger apertures (lower f-numbers) are preferable, such as a 14-24mm wide-angle lens or a telescope with a high-quality adapter.\n   - **Tripod:** A sturdy tripod is essential to minimize camera shake and achieve sharp images.\n   - **Remote Shutter Release:** Helps to avoid camera shake when taking multiple exposures.\n   - **Star Tracker:** For long-exposure shots of deep sky objects, a star tracker can significantly reduce blurring.\n\n2. **Scout the Location:**\n   - Find a dark sky location far from city lights, ideally away from light pollution.\n   - Check the weather forecast; clear skies are crucial.\n   - Visit the location beforehand to identify a good spot and understand the terrain.\n\n3. **Plan Your Shoot:**\n   - Use an astronomy app or star map to plan your shooting schedule. Apps like Stellarium, SkySafari, or websites like timeanddate.com can help.\n   - Determine the best time and direction for shooting specific celestial objects.\n   - Familiarize yourself with the night sky and find objects like planets, constellations, and galaxies.\n\n4. **Camera Settings:**\n   - **Mode:** Select Manual mode (M) to have full control over the camera settings.\n   - **Aperture:** Set to a wide aperture (low f-number, around f/2.8 or wider). Wider apertures allow more light to hit the sensor, which is beneficial for star photography.\n   - **Shutter Speed:** Start with a few seconds and increase as needed. Long exposures are often necessary to capture faint stars but be cautious of star trails due to the Earth's rotation.\n   - **ISO:** Set a higher ISO (100-1600 or higher) to increase sensitivity. Be mindful of noise, which can become apparent at higher ISO levels.\n   - **Focus:** Manually set the focus to infinity to ensure stars are sharp. Use live view and zoom in on a bright star to achieve precise focus.\n\n5. **Composition:**\n   - Include foreground elements (trees, mountains, buildings) to add interest and perspective.\n   - Balance the composition elements by placing stars, planets, or nebulae off-center.\n   - Pay attention to the rule of thirds for more aesthetically pleasing images.\n\n6. **Capture Multiple Exposures:**\n   - Take several exposures of the same scene to capture details in both the bright and faint celestial regions. Later, stack the images using software like DeepSkyStacker to enhance details and reduce noise.\n   - Shoot a base exposure with a longer exposure time to retain faint objects and a shorter exposure to keep bright objects sharp (exposure blending).\n\n7. **Post-Processing:**\n   - Use software like Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, or specialized astrophotography tools to adjust contrast, brightness, and color.\n   - Stack multiple exposures to bring out details and reduce noise.\n   - Apply noise reduction techniques while preserving textures to maintain the quality of the stars.\n\nBy following these tips and practicing regularly, you'll improve your ability to take stunning star photographs.", "shortest_response": "Taking great star photos requires some planning and the right equipment. Here are some tips to help you capture stunning star photos:\n\n1. **Camera**: Invest in a camera with manual settings and a good DSLR or mirrorless camera. A camera with manual focus, aperture, and shutter speed is essential.\n\n2. **Lenses**: Use a telephoto lens (at least 200mm) to magnify distant stars, and a tripod to stabilize your camera and avoid any blur.\n\n3. **Tripod**: A sturdy tripod is crucial to prevent camera shake and to make long-exposure images possible.\n\n4. **Darksky**: Find a location far from city lights to avoid light pollution. Dark sky locations offer clearer, more vibrant starlight.\n\n5. **Timing**: Night photography works best under a new moon when the sky is darkest. Avoid weekends and holidays when there is a full moon or bright city lights.\n\n6. **Manual Mode**: Switch your camera to manual mode and set the ISO between 800-3200. Set the aperture to around f/2.8 and the shutter speed to about 20-30 seconds. Adjust these based on your results.\n\n7. **Focus**: Set your camera focus to manual so that it doesn\u2019t switch to auto-focus, which will blur your stars.\n\n8. **Long Exposures**: Take multiple long-exposure shots. Experiment with different shutter speeds (e.g., 20 sec, 30 sec, 60 sec) to capture different levels of star trails and motion.\n\n9. **White Balance**: Use a custom white balance setting or shoot in RAW to adjust the white balance later in post-processing.\n\n10. **Noise Reduction**: Long exposure settings may increase noise. Use manual noise reduction techniques and shooting at lower ISOs can help reduce noise.\n\n11. **Editing**: Post-process your images using software like Lightroom, Photoshop, or dedicated astrophotography software. Stack multiple images, remove noise, adjust contrast, and enhance clarity.\n\n12. **Practice**: Keep practicing and experimenting with different settings and techniques to see what works best for you.\n\nRemember, the key to great star photos is patience and practice.

Here is a general overview of how to play baseball at a basic level:\n\n**Equipment Required:**\n- Baseball: A leather or synthetic ball.\n- Bat: Typically made of wood, aluminum, or composite materials.\n- Sticks: Grounders may use plastic paddles for drills.\n- Protective Gear: Gloves, helmet, masks, cleats, and possibly chest protectors and shin guards depending on the age and ability level.\n\n**Players:**\n- 9 players per team on the field (6 infielders and 3 on the outfield).\n- Pitcher, catcher, infielder positions (first baseman, second baseman, shortstop, third baseman, and pitcher), and one designated hitter (commonly used in the Major Leagues for pitchers).\n\n**Objective:**\n- Batter (or designated hitter) attempts to hit the ball hit by the pitcher and run around all bases and back to home plate to score runs.\n- Pitcher throws the baseball with the aim to strike out the batter or throw to fielders to get the batter or runners out.\n- Fielders (including the pitcher) catch and field the ball, and attempt to get the batter out or prevent the bases from being reached by the runners.\n\n**Basic Steps for Playing a Innings:**\n\n1. **Pitching the Ball (Outfield):**\n   - The pitcher stands on the pitcher's mound.\n   - The pitcher throws the baseball with the goal of striking out the batter, getting the batter or a fielding player to strike out, or getting a groundout.\n\n2. **Batting (Infield and Outfield):**\n   - The batter stands in the batter\u2019s box.\n   - Once the pitch is thrown, the batter swings the bat at the ball.\n\n3. **Fielding:**\n   - If the batter hits the ball, they run toward any base they are trying to reach. Fielders (particularly the pitcher, catcher, and first baseman) and the rest of the infielder will field the ball to try to get the batter or runners out.\n   - Common fielding plays include catches, force outs, tag outs, and plays at the base they are trying to reach (e.g., double plays).\n\n4. **Scoring:**\n   - A player touching all four bases and returning to home plate scores a run.\n   - Runs scored count towards the team\u2019s total.\n\n5. **Ending the Inning:**\n   - The team with the fewest runs scored after a series of three outs wins the game.\n\n**Varieties of Baseball:**\n- **Little League:** For younger players under 12. Rules are altered to ensure safety and promote beginners.\n- **Softball:** Similar to baseball but played with a softball, on infield grass, and larger spaces. It's usually aimed at younger players or women\u2019s and girls\u2019 teams.\n- **Major League Baseball (MLB):** Professional leagues with formalities and advanced rules. Major leagues have separate competitions for different genders. (MLB, WNBA, LRP, and NPB).\n\n**Practice Tips:**\n- Focus on proper form and technique when swinging the bat.\n- Practice fielding ground balls in different positions.\n- Improve hand-eye coordination and defensive skills such as catching, throwing, and running.\n- Develop pitching skills: arm strength, accuracy, and variety of pitches.\n- Work on catching gloves for better control.\n- Always warm up before playing to avoid injuries.\n\nPlaying baseball typically starts with a series of practices to get comfortable with the gear, basic skills, and understanding the rules. Once in the middle or high school leagues, players often participate in practice workouts, drills, and scrimmage games leading up to full-season games.\n\nIn summary, baseball combines elements of bat-and-ball games, emphasizing teamwork, hand-eye coordination, strategic thinking, and athletic skills. Whether playing informally, participating in leagues, or taking to the professional stage, there's a significant depth of skill and enjoyment to be found in baseball.", "shortest_response": "To play baseball, you'll first need access to a proper baseball field. The standard baseball field includes the infield, the outfield, base paths, and the pitcher's mound. Here are the basic steps to play a game:\n\n1. **Gather the team and equipment:**\n   - Players: Ensure you have an adequate number of players (10-11 on each team).\n   - Equipment: Helmets, gloves, cleats, and bat.\n   - Field: A well-marked diamond, usually surrounded by foul territory.\n\n2. **Set up the bases and pitching area:**\n   - Lay out the four bases in a diamond shape. The bases are first base, second base, third base, and home plate.\n   - Place the pitcher's mound at the center of the infield.\n\n3. **Understand the rules:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the basic rules and scoring of baseball.\n\n4. **Determine the batting order:**\n   - Select the batting order for your team.\n\n5. **Basic gameplay:**\n   - The pitcher throws the ball towards the batter.\n   - The batter tries to hit the ball with the bat, aiming to advance around the bases.\n   - The fielders attempt to catch the ball and get the batter out by throwing the ball to another base before he reaches it.\n   - The scoring plays as follows: a hit (singles) scores one run; a double (second base) scores 1 run; a triple (third base) scores 1 run; a home run (straight or around the bases) scores four runs.\n   - If the batter misses the ball and is not tagged out by the first baseman or other fielder, he is called out.\n\n6. **Turn-taking:**\n   - After the batter is out, the pitcher and other players rotate until the lineup is completed.\n   - Play continues in this rotation, with the pitching and batting changing every round.\n\nRemember that practice makes perfect, and you can always learn from observing professional games or joining a local baseball league to get more experience.

In 1954, the Western Development Division, under General Bernard Schriever, was established as the first dedicated space organization within the U.S. Armed Forces and continues to exist as the Space Force's Space and Missile Systems Center. Military space forces were organized under several different Air Force major commands until they were unified when Air Force Space Command was established on 1 September 1982. U.S. space forces first began conducting combat support operations in the Vietnam War and continued to provide satellite communications, weather, and navigation support during the 1982 Falklands War, 1983 United States invasion of Grenada, 1986 United States bombing of Libya, and 1989 United States invasion of Panama. The first major employment of space forces culminated in the Gulf War, where they proved so critical to the U.S.-led coalition that it is sometimes referred to as the first \"space war\".\n\nThe first discussions of creating a military space service occurred in 1958, and it was nearly established in 1982 by President Ronald Reagan as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative, but the idea dissolved with treaty compliance concerns.

Most electronic services are logging users into their accounts with a username and a password, but when one of those pieces of information is compromised, it can leave users vulnerable to having all of their information exposed.\n\n2FA requires users to verify their identity by presenting two different authentication factors. The idea of 2FA is that it's not just about the old \"something you know\" (such as a password) but also something \"you also have\" (such as a smartphone to receive an SMS code) or \"you are\" (such as a fingerprint or a selfie verification based on facial recognition).\n\nHere are the most common forms of 2FA:\n\n1. Something you know (knowledge factor) - This typically involves a password or PIN.\n2. Something you have (possession factor) - This includes a security token, a smartphone app that generates codes, or a physical key.\n3. Something you are (inherence factor) - Also known as biometric authentication, which could involve fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, or other biometric checks.\n\nTwo-factor authentication greatly improves security compared to just one-step authentication methods, like just remembering a password. This is because even if a malicious actor manages to get a victim's password, they won't be able to access their account without also having access to the second factor. For example, even if someone intercepts your password, they still won't be able to enter your account unless they also have access to your phone to receive an authentication code.\n\nMost people who have accounts in areas that could be targeted by cyber-attacks (like online banking or social media) will find it worth setting up 2FA, even if the implementation of 2FA is not required by the website or service.

Here are some steps and tips to help you achieve this:\n\n### 1. Site Selection\n- **Sunlight:** Choose a location with good sunlight exposure. Evergreens thrive in sunny spots.\n- **Soil:** Test the soil and amend it as necessary. Most evergreens prefer well-draining soil with a moderate pH level.\n- **Drainage:** Ensure the garden site has proper drainage to prevent waterlogging.\n\n### 2. Plant Selection\n- **Conifers:** Trees like pine, spruce, and fir. They are classic evergreens and vary in height and size.\n- **Deciduous Evergreen Trees:** Trees such as Arborvitae, Leyland Cypress, Thuja Green Giants, and Leyland Pines.\n- **Flowering Evergreens:** Some shrubs like boxwood, holly, and winter lilac which retain their foliage.\n- **Ground Cover and Edging Plants:** Creeping juniper, English ivy, and pachysandra.\n- **Hardy Evergreens:** Plants that can withstand winter conditions such as wintergreen, winter creeper, and boxwoods.\n\n### 3. Planting and Layout\n- **Layering:** Consider a layered planting approach with taller trees, mid-sized shrubs, and ground covers.\n- **Spacing:** Ensure adequate space between trees and shrubs to allow for mature growth and air circulation.\n- **Companion Planting:** Mix perennials and biennials that bloom in different seasons to extend the green presence.\n- **Grouping Plants:** Group plants with similar water and soil needs together.\n\n### 4. Maintenance\n- **Watering:** While evergreens generally require less water than deciduous plants, proper watering during drought conditions is crucial.\n- **Mulching:** Apply a layer of mulch around the base of plants to retain moisture, reduce weeds, and regulate soil temperature.\n- **Pruning:** Conduct seasonal pruning to maintain plant shape, remove dead or diseased wood, and encourage healthy growth.\n- **Fertilizing:** Feed your evergreen plants during the growing season with an appropriate fertilizer, but avoid over-fertilizing in winter.\n\n### 5. Seasonal Considerations\n- **Winter Care:** Protect evergreens from extreme cold by applying protective sprays or covers if necessary. Prune any winter-damaged branches in early spring.\n- **Spring Preparation:** Prepare the soil for planting during the winter months. Remove winter debris and plan your garden design during this period.\n\n### 6. Sustainability Practices\n- **Native Plants:** Incorporate native evergreen shrubs and trees, as they are well-adapted to your local environment and soil conditions.\n- **Water Conservation:** Use water-efficient practices, such as drip irrigation or soaker hoses, to keep efficient.\n- **Pollinator Support:** Plant evergreens that attract pollinators in addition to ensuring they maintain their foliage throughout the year.\n\n### 7. Example Plant Selections for an Evergreen Garden\n- **Trees:** Eastern White Pine (Pinus strobus), Cedar Hemlock (Thuja standishii)\n- **Shrubs:** Yew Shrub (Taxus baccata), Boxwood (Buxus spp.)\n- **Foliage Plants:** Winter Phlox (Phlox elatior), Snow-in-summer (Leucanthemum \u00d7 superbum)\n\nBy carefully selecting a variety of evergreen plants and following these guidelines, you can create a stunning, continuously green garden that enhances the beauty and serenity of your outdoor space year-round.", "shortest_response": "Creating an evergreen garden can provide year-round interest and beauty, even in the colder months.

The second largest cause of natural avalanches is metamorphic changes in the snowpack such as melting due to solar radiation. Other natural causes include rain, earthquakes, rockfall and icefall. Artificial triggers of avalanches include skiers, snowmobiles, and controlled explosive work. Contrary to popular belief, avalanches are not triggered by loud sound; the pressure from sound is orders of magnitude too small to trigger an avalanche.\n\nAvalanche initiation can start at a point with only a small amount of snow moving initially; this is typical of wet snow avalanches or avalanches in dry unconsolidated snow. However, if the snow has sintered into a stiff slab overlying a weak layer then fractures can propagate very rapidly, so that a large volume of snow, that may be thousands of cubic metres, can start moving almost simultaneously.\n\nA snowpack will fail when the load exceeds the strength. The load is straightforward; it is the weight of the snow. However, the strength of the snowpack is much more difficult to determine and is extremely heterogeneous. It varies in detail with properties of the snow grains, size, density, morphology, temperature, water content; and the properties of the bonds between the grains. These properties may all metamorphose in time according to the local humidity, water vapour flux, temperature and heat flux. The top of the snowpack is also extensively influenced by incoming radiation and the local air flow. One of the aims of avalanche research is to develop and validate computer models that can describe the evolution of the seasonal snowpack over time. A complicating factor is the complex interaction of terrain and weather, which causes significant spatial and temporal variability of the depths, crystal forms, and layering of the seasonal snowpack.", "longest_response": "Based on the context provided and understanding of the common causes of avalanches, the most common causes of avalanches in descending order of likelihood are:\n\n1. **Severe Storms and Snowfall**: Significant snowfall during storms increases the weight of snowpacks, triggering avalanches. The combination of new snow accumulation and existing snowpack reaching a critical load due to gravity and additional weight is most common.\n\n2. **Metamorphic Changes in the Snowpack**: Phenomena such as snow metamorphism, where the properties of snow grains and bonds change over time with factors such as melting from solar radiation or temperature fluctuations, can weaken snow layers and lead to avalanches.\n\n3. **Water Content Changes and Temperature Fluctuations**: Changes in water content within the snowpack due to melting and refreezing, or due to variations in temperature, can weaken the snowpack's structure, making it susceptible to failure.\n\n4. **Rain and Humidity Variations**: Although they may not be the primary trigger, persistent rain or high humidity can add weight and cause surface layers to weaken, leading to potential avalanches, especially in cold conditions.\n\n5. **Snowpack Structural Weakening**: Natural factors like the formation of wet snow avalanches in specific areas, the collapse of weak layers such as crusted or liquid water layers, and differences in snowpack structure and layering over time contribute to avalanche initiation.\n\n6. **Icefall and Rockfall**: In mountainous areas, icefalls and rockfall are natural phenomena that can create weak layers or trigger avalanches when blocks of snow or ice fall onto existing unstable layers below.\n\n7. **Artificial Triggers**: Activities like skiing, snowmobiling, and controlled explosive work can trigger avalanches by disturbing dormant snowpacks or dislodging weak layers, although these are typically considered less common compared to natural occurrences.\n\n8. **Earthquakes and Other Seismic Activity**: Earthquakes, while natural and rare, can trigger avalanches in susceptible areas by causing vibrations that destabilize snowpacks, typically in mountainous regions prone to tectonic activity.\n\nWhile these factors vary in their influence in different regions and conditions, snowstorms and snowpack metamorphism are generally the most prevalent causes of avalanches. Artificial triggers, although significant in certain areas with heavy recreational use, are less common and typically localized.", "shortest_response": "To summarize the most common causes of avalanches in descending order of likelihood:\n\n1.

During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters. For instance, the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title. Prior to the 1948\u201349 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional.\n\nOn August 3, 1949, the remaining NBL teams\u2013Syracuse, Anderson, Tri-Cities, Sheboygan, Denver, and Waterloo\u2013merged into the BAA. In deference to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications, the league name was changed to the present National Basketball Association, even though the merged league retained the BAA's governing body, including Maurice Podoloff as president. To this day, the NBA claims the BAA's history as its own. It now reckons the arrival of the NBL teams as an expansion, not a merger, and does not recognize NBL records and statistics.", "longest_response": "The history of the NBA, originally known as the Basketball Association of America (BAA), began in 1946 when several owners of major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada decided to create a new professional basketball league. This effort aimed to capitalize on the growing popularity of basketball among athletes, particularly college players who could turn professional after college.\n\nThe official founding of the BAA took place on November 1, 1946, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens. This game is recognized as NBA \"Game 1: NBA Game 1.\"\n\nThe founders sought to establish a league that could compete with other professional leagues, such as the National Basketball League (NBL), by playing predominantly in large arenas located in major cities. Early basketball leagues like the American Basketball League (ABL) and the NBL had paved the way, but the BAA set itself apart by focusing on larger venues that drew more crowds. \n\nThroughout its early years, the BAA's quality of play was comparable to other leading professional and independent teams, such as the Harlem Globetrotters and ABL teams. However, the league saw some success in expanding its player base with talented individuals from college institutions and other leagues.\n\nA crucial moment in the BAA's history was the merger with the NBL on August 3, 1949. Seven remaining NBL teams\u2014Syracuse, Anderson, Tri-Cities, Sheboygan, Denver, and Waterloo\u2014joined the BAA. This merger, which was designed to avoid legal complications, effectively transformed the league into the National Basketball Association (NBA). The merger consolidated the leagues' resources, player rosters, and organization.\n\nThe merger also meant a renaming to avoid confusion and to integrate the teams under one governing body, which included President Maurice Podoloff. As part of the transition, the NBA retained the BAA's history and records but omitted to officially recognize the NBL's records and statistics.\n\nThe NBA officially began its new chapter on October 28, 1950, when the newly named national champion Syracuse Nationals contested the NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers in the now-iconic \"Battle of the Capitals.\" This game marked the NBA's first season as a newly unified league.\n\nThe success of the merger led basketball to flourish both at the professional and collegiate levels. Key contributors such as George Mikan from the Minneapolis Lakers set a high benchmark for future talents. With an integrated structure and enhanced visibility due to television broadcasts, the NBA quickly established itself as one of the premier leagues in North American sports.\n\nFrom its competitive roots, the NBA expanded globally, with players, teams, and events reaching international audiences. Over the decades, it has grown into a leading platform for basketball prowess, fostering talented athletes while developing an enduring cultural and sports legacy. The NBA's history is now a cornerstone for the popular and commercially successful basketball league we know today.", "shortest_response": "The National Basketball Association (NBA) was founded on June 6, 1946, through the merger of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), established on November 1, 1946, and the National Basketball League (NBL). \n\nThe BAA had been founded by four major ice hockey arena owners in the northeastern United States and in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It held its first game on November 1, 1946, in Toronto between the Toronto Huskies and the New York Knickerbockers, resulting in a score of 68 to 66 in the Knickerbockers' favor.\n\nPrior to the 1948-49 season, the original BAA teams were joined by NBL teams from cities such as Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester, establishing a strong, competitive league. The merger of the NBL and the BAA on August 3, 1949, led to the consolidation of these teams into what is now known as the NBA, although it's claimed that this was an \"expansion\" rather than a \"merger\".\n\nPrior to this consolidation, the NBA also claimed the BAA's early history as its own, incorporating NBL records and statistics into their own story.

Here are some common ways to tenderize beef:\n\n1. **Mechanical Tenderizing**:\n   - **Brining**: Submerge the beef in a solution of saltwater mixed with a bit of sugar and aromatics such as garlic, herbs, or spices. The salt helps to break down muscle fibers and make the meat more tender. Typically, brining for 30 minutes to a few hours will achieve good results.\n   - **Pounding with a Meat Mallet**: Use a meat mallet or rolling pin to pound the beef until it becomes thinner and has a more uniform texture. This can also be done by wrapping the meat in plastic wrap or placing a cloth over the meat and then pounding it.\n   - **Marinade**: Combining mechanical tenderizing methods with a marinade containing acidic components (like vinegar, citrus juice, or yogurt) can further break down muscles. Marinate the beef for several hours to overnight.\n   - **Parchment Paper Pressing**: Wrap the beef in a piece of parchment paper and use a heavy object like a meat pounder, rolling pin, or even the bottom of a heavy, tall mixing bowl to press down on the beef. This method helps to achieve a finer texture.\n   - **Using Tenderizing Grout or Mallet**: Many restaurants and food processors use a specific tool designed to mechanically tenderize meat. These tools crush the fibers and reduce the muscle size.\n\n2. **Chemical Tenderizing**:\n   - **Marinating with Baking Soda**: Adding baking soda or a similar alkaline substance to a marinade can help to relax the muscle fibers and break them down. However, use this sparingly, as it can make the meat excessively soft or mushy.\n   - **Adding Enzymes**: Commercial meat tenderizers often contain enzymes like papain (derived from papaya) or bromelain (found in pineapple). These enzymes help to break down proteins in the meat, making it tender. Be sure to follow the package instructions for the correct amount.\n\n3. **Slow Cooking**: Cooking beef slowly in a moist environment, such as in a crockpot or sous-vide, breaks down connective tissue, making it more tender over time. This method is excellent for tougher cuts of beef like chuck roast or brisket.\n\n4. **Using a Stand Mixer with a Whisk Attachment**: Some high-powered stand mixers come with a specific whisk attachment that can tenderize meat mechanically as it whips the ingredients together.\n\n5. **Boiling in Beef Stock**: Slowly simmering meat in a beef stock bath can gently break down the fibers while infusing the meat with rich flavors.\n\nEach of these methods, and often a combination of them, can help to tenderize beef, making it more enjoyable to eat. Select the one that best suits your equipment, recipe, and desired level of tenderness.", "shortest_response": "Tenderizing beef can enhance the texture and flavor of the meat. Here are some common methods:\n\n1. **Mechanical Tenderizers**:\n   - **Meat Mallets**: Gently pounding the beef with a meat mallet helps break down the muscle fibers and collagen, making it more tender.\n   - **Food Processors**: Some people use a food processor to tenderize larger cuts of beef, combined with other ingredients like herbs.\n\n2. **Chemical Tenderizers**:\n   - **Marinades**: Ingredients such as vinegar, lemon juice, or pineapple juice contain natural enzymes like bromelain (found in pineapple) and papain (found in papaya) that can break down proteins in meat and make it tender. Marinating for several hours or overnight is common.\n   - **Enzyme Tablets**: Products like Tendermaster contain enzymes that can be sprinkled on the beef before cooking to tenderize.\n\n3. **Cooking Methods**:\n   - **Slow Cooking or Braising**: Cooking beef slowly at low temperatures in liquid can help break down tough fibers. Braising typically involves searing the beef first and then cooking it in a covered pot with broth and seasonings.\n   - **Searing**: Briefly searing the beef in a hot pan helps to create a crust that can contain the moisture during the cooking process, resulting in a tender interior.\n\n4. **Freezing (Dry Method)**:\n   - **Chilling**: Chilling the beef for a couple of days in the refrigerator can make it cold to the touch and more tender. The cold temperature can help break down the muscle fibers.\n   - **Freeze-Breaking**: This involves placing the beef in a container, freezing it, and then thawing it slowly in the refrigerator. The fluctuating temperatures can help tenderize the meat.\n\n5. **Pounding and Tenderizing Boards**:\n   - Using a specialized beef tenderizing board combined with firm mallets can help tenderize larger cuts or tougher meats like brisket effectively.\n\nCombining these methods often yields the best results. Marinating for several hours or slow cooking in dishes like stews, braises, or roasts are excellent techniques for tenderizing beef for most cooking styles.", "input_size": 12, "output_sizes": [480, 539, 515, 479, 543, 455, 605, 478, 485, 515], "output_mean": 509.4, "output_std": 41.88, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 479.25, "p50": 500.0, "p75": 533.0, "p99": 599.42}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "open_qa", "gen_time": 12.17199}, {"sample_id": "8bd029704bde6e3b", "prompt_id": "8b31b1677804394b", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Given the reference text below, what is Air Jordan?\nContext: Air Jordan is a line of basketball shoes and athletic apparel produced by American corporation Nike, Inc.

The Bethesda Fountain glistened under the early sunlight, the water's surface dancing to the tune of the air currents.\n\n\nAmidst a quiet corner, a group of children played tag, their glee infectious, spreading mirth wherever they went.

It is a double-sided, resonant jaw harp made from a hollowed-out wood. The Kacapi is played with the teeth and lips of the mouth as a player produces a buzzing sound on the strings. While percussion instruments involve striking an instrument to create sound, the Kacapi could be mistaken for a percussion instrument due to its similarity to the harmonica, which is percussion-based. However, given its classification and the method of playing it, the Kacapi is a string instrument as it relies on plucking or buzzing the strings to produce sound, rather than the striking used in percussion.\n\nIn summary, both instruments are considered percussive due to their primary method of sound production. The Kacapi, however, traditionally falls under the string instrument category in Indonesian musical taxonomy due to its method of sound production, albeit it shares similarities with wind and percussion instruments.

It is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum. It is also known as Holy Friday, Great Friday, Great and Holy Friday (also Holy and Great Friday), and Black Friday.\n\nMembers of many Christian denominations, including the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist, Oriental Orthodox, United Protestant and some Reformed traditions (including certain Continental Reformed, Presbyterian and Congregationalist churches), observe Good Friday with fasting and church services. In many Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican and Methodist churches, the Service of the Great Three Hours' Agony is held from noon until 3 pm, the time duration that the Bible records as darkness covering the land to Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross. Communicants of the Moravian Church have a Good Friday tradition of cleaning gravestones in Moravian cemeteries.\n\nThe date of Good Friday varies from one year to the next in both the Gregorian and Julian calendars. Eastern and Western Christianity disagree over the computation of the date of Easter and therefore of Good Friday. Good Friday is a widely instituted legal holiday around the world, including in most Western countries and 12 U.S. states. Some predominantly Christian countries, such as Germany, have laws prohibiting certain acts such as dancing and horse racing, in remembrance of the somber nature of Good Friday", "longest_response": "Apart from Good Friday, Easter Vigil or Easter Eve, the last day of Holy Week, is sometimes linked with the events commemorated on Good Friday. In Anglican, Lutheran, and some Methodist traditions, the Easter Vigil marks the ending of Lent, Christ's resurrection, and is observed with celebrations that include lighting candles, sharing the Easter bread, and singing hymns. However, these are separate observances.\n\nEaster itself, also known as Eastern Christianity's \"Festum Paschale\" or \"Pascha\" (meaning \"Passover\" or \"Passacione\" in Italian), is the primary Christian feast commemorating the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and it immediately follows Easter Vigil, which actually marks the beginning of this feast. Some communities refer to the period leading up to Easter as the \"Lord's Supper\" (Lent) or \"The Seventies\" (the seven-week period of Lent).\n\nIn some Christian communities, Lent may be called various other names:\n- Holy Week, Holy Week, Passion Week, or Holy Week, which spans seven weeks from Ash Wednesday to Good Friday.\n- The Great Fast or Great Lent, signifying the more formalized period of fasting and preparation for Easter that extends from Ash Wednesday to Holy Saturday before Easter Vigil.\n\nThese terminologies encapsulate varying aspects of the Passion and Resurrection narratives in Christianity and may differ based on cultural and denominational traditions. Each name emphasizes different elements of the overarching Easter celebration, from preparation to commemoration of both Christ's Passion and Resurrection. \n\nIf looking for terms used mainly in specific Christian traditions or to highlight particular aspects of Easter celebrations, each denomination and location might have their own terms, which can sometimes overlap but usually retain unique meanings or interpretations.", "shortest_response": "Good Friday is also known by several other names:\n\n- Holy Friday\n- Great Friday\n- Great and Holy Friday (also referred to as Holy and Great Friday)\n\nThese names all reflect the significance of the day in commemorating the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ.", "input_size": 301, "output_sizes": [138, 125, 148, 351, 67, 103, 57, 57, 114, 100], "output_mean": 126.0, "output_std": 81.0, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 75.25, "p50": 108.5, "p75": 134.75, "p99": 332.73}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "summarization", "gen_time": 7.1791}, {"sample_id": "a47686568b0865fc", "prompt_id": "02cd571e486531d5", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Where are the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and which islands are a part of the BVI?\nContext: The British Virgin Islands (BVI), officially the Virgin Islands, are a British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean, to the east of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands and north-west of Anguilla.

Even harmless snake species might appear frightening to humans from a distance due to their unfamiliar movement patterns and the way they move silently.\n\n2. **Biological Perspective**: Evolution may have hardwired certain responses in our brains. Phobias, including ophidiophobia, can arise from a basic fight-or-flight response triggered by a perceived threat. Humans' fear of certain animals, including snakes, could be remnants of ancient survival mechanisms.\n\n3. **Cultural and Personal Experiences**: Societal attitudes toward snakes play a significant role. In many cultures, snakes are associated with danger, evil, or mythology. This cultural lore gets internalized, especially when combined with occasional personal experiences (such as a scary encounter with a snake, seeing snakebites featured in media, or growing up with stories of snake attacks). These experiences can amplify fear.\n\n4. **Biological Reactions**: The human body often struggles to clearly differentiate harmful from harmless snakes. Snakes can move in ways that evoke fear, like slithering and unpredictable movements. Furthermore, snake-skin patterns that mimic human faces can trigger responses tied to our instinctual distrust of faces that resemble ours, even if partially.\n\n5. **Visual and Sensory Perception**: Snakes have an ability to appear bigger or more menacing, particularly if they are seen from a distance or partially hidden behind objects. Their long, slender bodies and undistinguishable features from humans can amplify fear.\n\nUnderstanding and managing these fears often involve education about snakes, awareness of common misconceptions, and gentle exposure to decrease phobic reactions over time. Therapy, especially cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can also be effective in addressing and reducing the fear of snakes.", "shortest_response": "People's fear of snakes, known scientifically as ophidiophobia, is a natural and common response that stems from evolutionary, psychological, and cultural factors.\n\n1. **Evolutionary Factors**: From an evolutionary perspective, snakes can be venomous and pose a significant danger to humans, particularly if caught off guard. The instinct to avoid potentially harmful animals is rooted in our ancestors' survival. Snakes' venomous bites and ability to appear suddenly and suddenly could increase the likelihood of being injured.\n\n2. **Psychological Factors**: A psychological response involving fear can be triggered by the snake's physical attributes and behaviors. Snakes have no legs, slither silently, and often curl into balls when threatened, making them appear more menacing and unpredictable. These characteristics can induce a natural fear response.\n\n3. **Societal and Cultural Factors**: Cultural influences also play a significant role. Throughout history, snakes have been associated with danger and evil in myths, legends, and folklore across various cultures. Movies, books, and other media often perpetuate this association, further embedding the fear of snakes into human culture.\n\n4. **Personal Experiences**: Personal experiences, such as a close encounter or witnessing someone else being bitten, can also significantly impact an individual's fear of snakes. \n\nUnderstanding these factors can help people manage their fear and gradually work through it, potentially reducing their anxiety around snakes.", "input_size": 10, "output_sizes": [323, 322, 296, 421, 407, 411, 342, 393, 339, 280], "output_mean": 353.4, "output_std": 48.23, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 322.25, "p50": 340.5, "p75": 403.5, "p99": 420.1}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 8.45107}, {"sample_id": "45ab3edb697b1ad4", "prompt_id": "021dc75dce7ea32d", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "From the passage note down the name of the countries which have most voting power.

Inside the core, hydrogen atoms are fused to form helium, releasing energy that radiates outward.\n\n2. **Radiative Zone**: Surrounding the core, the radiative zone (up to about 0.7 solar radii from the center) is where energy produced in the core is transported outward by the means of radiation.\n\n3. **Convective Zone**: Beyond the radiative zone lies the convective zone, which extends to the Sun's visible surface. Here, energy moves in giant convection cells, transferring heat through the movement of the solar plasma.\n\n4. **Photosphere**: The photosphere is the visible surface of the Sun, with a temperature of about 5,500 degrees Celsius (9,932 degrees Fahrenheit). The Sun's visible light, as well as ultraviolet radiation, are emitted from this layer.\n\n5. **Chromosphere and Corona**: Above the photosphere are the chromosphere and corona, where the Sun's plasma expands. The corona is extremely hot (millions of degrees), far hotter than the Sun's surface. These layers are visible during solar eclipses and are the source of solar winds.\n\n6. **Solar Wind**: The Sun emits a continuous flow of charged particles known as the solar wind, which can affect planetary atmospheres and technologies on Earth.\n\n7. **Sunspot Cycles**: The Sun's magnetic activity causes sunspots to appear intermittently, cycling roughly every 11 years during the solar cycle.\n\n8. **Influence on the Solar System**: The Sun's gravity holds together the Solar System, and its energy drives weather and climate on Earth. Solar phenomena can influence technological systems on Earth (e.g., geomagnetic storms), as well as the atmospheres and surfaces of other planets and celestial bodies.\n\n9. **Nuclear Fusion and Energy Production**: The Sun's fusion process converts 620 billion tonnes of hydrogen into helium each second, providing a staggering amount of energy, approximately 3.8 x 10^26 watts.

They do not depend on any shifting by a base value or offsets, so they are often easier to access directly. In computers, absolute addresses are crucial for several operations, including direct memory access and efficient execution of instructions.\n\nFor instance, in an x86 architecture, absolute addressing can be used as follows:\n\n- **32-bit Addressing**: In this case, addresses range from 0x00000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF (0x0 to 0x3FFFFFFF). Each address uniquely identifies a byte in memory.\n\n- **26-bit Addressing with Segment Base Register (EBP, etc.)**: In architectures like x86, the lowest 16 bits of the address identify the location within one of these 64KB pages. The top 20 bits might point to the segment base. For example, an absolute address might look like `0x01A2B3C4D5E6F`, where `0x01A2B3C4D5E6` is the segment base, and `D5E6F` is the offset within that segment.\n\nAbsolute memory addresses are particularly critical for certain low-level programming tasks, inter-process communication, and when direct hardware interaction is required.\n\nHowever, modern operating systems and programming practices also emphasize memory management techniques to avoid potential security issues and the pitfalls of manual memory address referencing (such as dereferencing null pointers).

In the first place, the romantics, particularly Victor Hugo. Later on, and in a decisive fashion, Dar\u00edo was influenced by the parnassians: Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, Catulle Mend\u00e8s, and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Heredia. Another decisive influence was the writer of prose and poetry and national hero of Cuba, Jose Mart\u00ed. The final defining element of Darianian aesthetic is his admiration towards the symbolists, especially Paul Verlaine. Recapitulating his own poetic trajectory in the initial poem of Cantos de vida y esperanza (1905) Dar\u00edo himself synthesized his main influences when he affirms that he was \"strong with Hugo and ambiguous with Verlaine\" (\"con Hugo fuerte y con Verlaine ambiguo\".)\n\nIn the section \"Palabras Liminares\" of Prosas Profanas (1896) he had already written a paragraph that reveals the importance of French culture in the development of his literary work:\n\nThe old Spaniard with a white beard points towards a series of illustrious portraits: \"This one\u2014he says\u2014is the great Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, one-handed genius; this one is Lope de Vega, this one is Garcilaso, this one Quintana.\" I ask him for the noble man Graci\u00e1n, for Teresa of \u00c1vila, for the brave G\u00f3ngora and the strongest of all, Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas. Then I say: \"Shakespeare! Dante! Hugo...! (and in my head: Verlaine...!)\"\nThen, when saying goodbye: \"-Old man, it is important to say: my wife is from my land; my mistress is from Paris.\"\n\nLos raros is an illustrative volume regarding literary tastes, which he published on the same year as Prosas profanas, and dedicated to briefly glossing some of the writers and intellectuals towards whom he felt profound admiration. Amongst those in the book we find Edgar Allan Poe, Villiers de l'Isle Adam, L\u00e9on Bloy, Paul Verlaine, Lautr\u00e9amont, Eug\u00e9nio de Castro and Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed (the latter being the only one mentioned who wrote their literary work in Spanish.) The predominance of French culture is more than evident. Dar\u00edo wrote: \"Modernism is nothing more than Spanish verse and prose passed through the fine sieve of the good French verse and the good French prose.\" Setting aside his initial stage, before Azul..., in which his poetry owes a great deal to the great names of 19th-century Spanish poetry, such as N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Arce and Campoamor, Dar\u00edo was a great admirer of B\u00e9cquer. Spanish themes are well represented in his work, already in Prosas profanas and, specially, after his second trip to Spain, in 1899. Conscious of contemporaneous Spanish decadence in politics and the arts (a preoccupation he shared with the so-called Generation of '98), he frequently was inspired by characters and elements of the past. Regarding authors in other languages, it is worth mentioning that he felt a profound admiration towards three writers from the United States: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Edgar Allan Poe and Walt Whitman.[citation needed]", "longest_response": "The names of influencers on Ruben Dar\u00edo's poetry mentioned in the provided context are:\n\n1.

Rust focuses on safety and concurrency without sacrificing speed.\n\n3. **Go**: Developed by Google, Go is designed for simplicity and performance, particularly in the realm of concurrent processing. It features fast compilation times and has strong support for network programming.\n\n4. **Java and JavaScript (Node.js)**: While not known primarily for raw performance, these languages can be quite efficient in certain contexts, especially when optimized for the Just-In-Time (JIT) and Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilers used by modern platforms. JavaScript, in particular, can be very performant with Node.js and JavaScript engines like V8 (used in Chrome, V8, and Node.js).\n\n5. **Elixir and Erlang**: For highly concurrent applications, especially those requiring fault-tolerant networking and distribution, Erlang and Elixir (which is built on top of Erlang) are excellent choices. They use the Actor model for efficient concurrency and are ideal for distributed systems.\n\n6. **Swift**: Designed for iOS and macOS development, Swift is optimized for performance and safety. It combines the benefits of low-level language constructs with high-level language safety features.\n\nEfficiency can also be influenced by various factors, such as how well a language compiles to machine code, its runtime environment, and specific optimization techniques employed by the developer.

Here are several reasons why you might choose to use a fabric softener:\n\n1. **Improved Skin Feel**: Fabric softeners reduce static cling and create a smoother fabric feel, which can be more pleasant to the skin, particularly for natural materials that can sometimes feel harsher when machine-washed.\n\n2. **Softness Enhancement**: As you've mentioned, fabric softeners help to soften the surface of the textiles, making your clothes feel softer and more comfortable to wear.\n\n3. **Reduced Fraying and Fraying**: By preventing the fibers from fraying and fraying during the dry cycle, fabric softeners help maintain the quality and appearance of your textiles over time, reducing the need for frequent repairs or replacements due to roughness and wear.\n\n4. **Reduced Static Cling**: Fabric softeners often contain ingredients that are designed to reduce static electricity, which can make fabrics like wool and synthetic fibers smoother and less likely to cling together or attract dust.\n\n5. **Energy Efficiency and Laundry Scent**: Some fabric softeners are formulated to use less energy, making your laundry process potentially more environmentally friendly.\n\n6. **Enhanced Detergent Performance**: Fabric softeners can also improve the performance of your laundry detergent by working together to remove dirt and odors more effectively. This can result in cleaner clothes without requiring a large amount of detergent.\n\n7. **Comfort and Practicality**: Many people find that their freshly laundered clothes feel smoother and more comfortable, which can be particularly beneficial for items of clothing that are worn frequently, such as t-shirts, underwear, or towels.\n\nHowever, if you prefer not to use a fabric softener or have clothing that might benefit from it, such as jeans or denim, be aware that this is common knowledge and personal preference.\n\nIn summary, fabric softeners can add softness, reduce static, and overall improve the textile care process, particularly for natural fibers like cotton and wool.

A typical HTTP request message contains four components:\n\n1. **Request Line**: This defines the request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), the target resource (URL), and the HTTP version.\n\n2. **Headers**: It is a collection of key-value pairs, which provide additional information about the request or the client's preferences.

For example, form data.\n\n4. **Empty Line**: It is an empty line to separate request headers from the body and is not sent to the server.\n\nHTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that a server does not retain any information about the client's previous requests. This helps to simplify the architecture and design of the World Wide Web.\n\nHTTP primarily consists of two types of messages:\n\n1. **Request messages** (or request lines): Used by clients (e.g., web browsers) to submit requests to the web server, requesting data from its resources (e.g., web pages, images, etc).\n\n2. **Response messages**: Used by servers to return resources to clients.

Here are some key reasons why people may be afraid of sharks:\n\n1. **Media Representation:** Sharks are often depicted in movies and television shows as vicious killers, which can create lasting and exaggerated fears. Popular films like \"Jaws,\" \"The Meg,\" \"Deep Blue Sea,\" and even certain commercials have contributed to the perception of sharks as dangerous predators.\n\n2. **Aggressive Encounters:** Although shark attacks are rare, each instance tends to receive significant media attention. High-profile attacks, such as those involving people like Steve Irwin or surfers like Jake Hamman, can leave a lasting impression on the public consciousness.\n\n3. **Vulnerable Populations:** Younger individuals, particularly children, may have heightened fear of sharks influenced by stories, movies, and educational material that portray sharks as dangerous. Children may also pick up anxiety through news reports of shark encounters and sightings.\n\n4. **Stereotype and Misconception:** There is a common stereotype that all sharks pose a threat to humans. In reality, sharks are curious animals that usually steer clear of humans and prefer to eat smaller marine animals, mammals, and other fish. Most shark species, particularly reef sharks, have been documented as harmless in their natural habitats.\n\n5. **Safety Concerns:** The idea that sharks are inherently aggressive and pose a threat in popular culture can lead people to overestimate the danger they face during activities like swimming, surfing, or diving in shark-infested waters.\n\n6. **Lack of Information:** Misunderstandings about shark behavior and species can exacerbate fears. With millions of species of sharks, each with unique behaviors and diets, misinformation can spread rapidly and reinforce unfounded fears.\n\n7. **Personal Encounters and Anecdotes:** Personal stories, whether they involve genuine encounters or fictional tales, can significantly heighten one's fears. Hearing about someone else\u2019s negative experience with sharks can resonate more strongly than statistical facts about shark-human interactions.\n\nOverall, while sharks are not inherently a threat to humans, these factors combined contribute to the widespread and often disproportionate fear people have of them.

Misrepresentation: Some portrayals in media depict sharks as aggressive predators always looking to attack humans, which is not an accurate representation.\n\n4. Natural Fear: The idea of a huge, powerful, and somewhat unfriendly animal can naturally provoke fear.\n\n5. Scarcity of Shark Sightings: Humans are more likely to see dogs, cats, or other familiar animals, and less likely to encounter sharks. The rarity of shark sightings can feed into the perception that they are a threat.\n\n6.

This trapeze act is a combination of aerial acrobatics, agility, and synchronization with a partner, often referred to as the \"catcher.\" The performance is generally done over a net which catches the flyer if they miss their catch, adding an extra layer of excitement and safety.\n\nThe act begins with the flyer using a pedestal to jump and grab the trapeze bar. From that point on, they swing under and across the bar in a forward motion. Gravity becomes the primary force driving the movement, and the flyer generates momentum to continue swinging back and forth. During the swing, several key positions are executed:\n\n1. Force Out: At the far end of the initial swing, the flyer releases the bar and uses horizontal momentum to catapult themselves forward, aiming to reconnect with the bar on the opposite side of the swing.\n2. Beat Back and Rise: As the flyer swings towards the second bar, they perform a series of maneuvers called the \"beat back\" before catching the bar again.\n3. Seven: This is a complex aerial maneuver where the flyer rotates seven full times while swinging backward. It\u2019s an integral part of flying trapeze routines and showcases the performer's versatility and skill.\n\nThe catcher then catches the flyer from either a stationary trapeze or an overhead trapeze (cradle) and simultaneously performs their own aerial feats. This interplay between the flyer and catcher creates a highly synchronized and often visually stunning performance.\n\nFlying trapeze acts can vary in complexity from basic solo maneuvers to elaborate routines involving multiple trapezes and intricate interactions.

This helps create openings for the seeds to pop out.\n   - **Open Slowly:** Once a half is cut off, gently tap it on a flat surface to release the seeds. The seeds should fall out into a bowl or plate ready for eating.\n\n2. **Funnel Method:**\n   - **Prepare a Bowl:** Place a metal or silicone colander over a bowl to catch the seeds.\n   - **Halve the Pomegranate:** Cut the pomegranate in half along the equator to ensure even-sized pieces.\n   - **Tip and Press:** Hold the pomegranate half and tap it gently. The seeds should pop out into the colander below. This method helps avoid damage since the inner membrane won't be cut and seeds won\u2019t scatter in the air.\n\n3. **Water Method:**\n   - **Immerse in Water:** Fill a large bowl with water and gently submerge the pomegranate. The seeds are enclosed in the membranes, which are more easily broken in water.\n   - **Sprinkle Salt:** Adding a pinch of salt helps release the membrane's grip faster.\n   - **Use a Colander:** Use a colander to catch the seeds as they burst out from the submerged pomegranate.\n\n4. **Knife Method:**\n   - **Cut and Score:** Cut around the pomegranate, scoring away from yourself. Once the halves are cut, you can carefully tip each half to release the seeds with a flat knife (also known as the \"scoring method\").\n   - **Gently Tap:** Tap the halved pomegranate onto a firm surface to let seeds fall away. Hold the knife close to the cut and gently tap seeds out.\n\n**Safety Tips:**\n\n- Always cut away from your body to avoid accidental cuts.\n- Use a sharp knife to ensure smooth cuts and easier extraction of seeds.\n- Do the cutting and scoring slowly to ensure control and prevent accidental bursts.\n\nWith these methods, you should be able to open a pomegranate safely and enjoy its delicious seeds without an explosion!", "shortest_response": "Opening a pomegranate can indeed seem like an explosive task due to its tough exterior. However, with a bit of technique, you can do it relatively easily without any risk. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Gently Tap the Pomegranate**: Place the pomegranate on a stable, hard surface and lightly tap it against a countertop or similar surface. This will help loosen the membranes inside.\n\n2. **Score the Pomegranate Shell**: Hold the pomegranate in one hand and use the other hand to carefully cut a shallow slit around the pomegranate about a quarter-inch in depth. You can use a sharp paring knife or a butter knife for this. Make sure to cut along the lines between the segments but don\u2019t cut deeply.\n\n3. **Twist to Open**: Once you have made the slit, holding the pomegranate by its stem (the long white pithy stem between the seed compartments), place your thumb on one side and your index finger on the other side of the slit. Gently twist back and forth until the two halves come apart. Be sure to do this carefully and avoid twisting too hard to prevent the burst.\n\n4. **Remove Seeds with Care**: Once the pomegranate is open, rotate the halves and gently separate the orange-pink arils (the seed \u201ccaviar\u201d) from the white membrane. You can use your fingers or a small spoon for this if necessary.\n\nUsing this method should help you open your pomegranate without any mess or risk of getting seeds everywhere!

For a balance of versatility, safety, and ease of use, the P-Merger and BD Pow-Raceless M-D System are highly recommended.\n\nFor touring enthusiasts who prioritize a lighter setup and are ready to possibly invest in specialized tools for adjustments, Leki bindings are excellent choices. Always test your bindings in controlled conditions before heading out on extended tours to ensure they meet your safety and performance standards.", "shortest_response": "When it comes to ski touring, the best binding setup often depends on personal preference, skill level, ski style, and the specific tour you plan to undertake. However, a commonly recommended setup for many ski tourers is a traditional three-pin binding system, also known as a T15 binding. Here\u2019s why this setup is often preferred:\n\n1. **Familiarity and Control**: Many ski tourers have grown up with three-pin bindings and are very familiar with their feel and how they release. This allows more precise control over the release, which is crucial during touring where quick stops and starts are necessary.\n\n2. **Boot Flex**: Three-pin bindings often work better with stiffer boots, which gives skiers better edge control. The placement of the pins under the ball of the foot provides excellent leverage for turning and walking.\n\n3. **Reliability**: The simplicity of the three-pin system often translates to greater reliability, which is paramount in backcountry or touring situations where you can\u2019t easily replace a binding if it fails.\n\n4. **Compatibility**: Three-pin bindings can accept a wide variety of ski boot models, making them versatile choices for many ski tourers.\n\nHowever, there are some situations where different binding setups might be better:\n\n- **Twin-Pin Bindings**: Some adventurers prefer the more powerful release of twin-pin bindings (such as 4+1 or 3+3). These can be beneficial on powder and steeper terrain where more force might be needed.\n\n- **Adjustable Bindings**: Systems like the Black Diamond Avalanche series allow for more fine-tuned adjustments, which can be helpful for individuals with specific needs.\n\n- **Tour Boots**: These boots are specially designed for touring and usually come with their own bindings. Opting for dedicated tour boots with bindings like the G-Form's F1 or Salewa\u2019s Tour 4+1 can improve your overall touring experience.\n\nUltimately, the best setup for you will depend on what works best for your feet, boot, and skiing style. It's always a good idea to get fitted for your bindings and to possibly consult with a knowledgeable local shop or ski technician.

That same year, Prime Minister George Grenville proposed direct taxes on the colonies to raise revenue, but he delayed action to see whether the colonies would propose some way to raise the revenue themselves.\n\nGrenville had asserted in 1762 that the whole revenue of the custom houses in America amounted to one or two thousand pounds sterling a year, and that the English exchequer was paying between seven and eight thousand pounds a year to collect. Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations that Parliament \"has never hitherto demanded of [the American colonies] anything which even approached to a just proportion to what was paid by their fellow subjects at home.\" Benjamin Franklin would later testify in Parliament in 1766 to the contrary, reporting that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He argued that local colonial governments had raised, outfitted, and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France in just the French and Indian War alone\u2014as many as Britain itself sent\u2014and spent many millions from American treasuries doing so.\n\nParliament finally passed the Stamp Act in March 1765, which imposed direct taxes on the colonies for the first time. All official documents, newspapers, almanacs, and pamphlets were required to have the stamps\u2014even decks of playing cards. The colonists did not object that the taxes were high; they were actually low. They objected to their lack of representation in the Parliament, which gave them no voice concerning legislation that affected them. The British were, however, reacting to an entirely different issue: at the conclusion of the recent war the Crown had to deal with approximately 1,500 politically well-connected British Army officers. The decision was made to keep them on active duty with full pay, but they\u2014and their commands\u2014also had to be stationed somewhere. Stationing a standing army in Great Britain during peacetime was politically unacceptable, so they determined to station them in America and have the Americans pay them through the new tax. The soldiers had no military mission however; they were not there to defend the colonies because there was no current threat to the colonies.\n\nThe Sons of Liberty formed shortly after the Act in 1765, and they used public demonstrations, boycotts, and threats of violence to ensure that the British tax laws were unenforceable. In Boston, the Sons of Liberty burned the records of the vice admiralty court and looted the home of chief justice Thomas Hutchinson. Several legislatures called for united action, and nine colonies sent delegates to the Stamp Act Congress in New York City in October. Moderates led by John Dickinson drew up a Declaration of Rights and Grievances stating that taxes passed without representation violated their rights as Englishmen, and colonists emphasized their determination by boycotting imports of British merchandise.\n\nThe Parliament at Westminster saw itself as the supreme lawmaking authority throughout the Empire and thus entitled to levy any tax without colonial approval or even consultation. They argued that the colonies were legally British corporations subordinate to the British Parliament, and they pointed to numerous instances where Parliament had made laws in the past that were binding on the colonies. Parliament insisted that the colonists effectively enjoyed a \"virtual representation\", as most British people did, since only a small minority of the British population elected representatives to Parliament. However, Americans such as James Otis maintained that there was no one in Parliament responsible specifically for any colonial constituency, so they were not \"virtually represented\" by anyone in Parliament at all.\n\nThe Rockingham government came to power in July 1765, and Parliament debated whether to repeal the stamp tax or to send an army to enforce it. Benjamin Franklin made the case for repeal, explaining that the colonies had spent heavily in manpower, money, and blood defending the empire in a series of wars against the French and indigenous people, and that further taxes to pay for those wars were unjust and might bring about a rebellion. Parliament agreed and repealed the tax on February 21, 1766, but they insisted in the Declaratory Act of March 1766 that they retained full power to make laws for the colonies \"in all cases whatsoever\". The repeal nonetheless caused widespread celebrations in the colonies.\n\n1767\u20131773: Townshend Acts and the Tea Act\nMain articles: Townshend Acts and Tea Act\nFurther information: Crisis of 1772, Massachusetts Circular Letter, Boston Massacre, and Boston Tea Party\n\nLetter III of John Dickinson's Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, published in the Pennsylvania Chronicle, December 1767\nIn 1767, the Parliament passed the Townshend Acts which placed duties on a number of staple goods, including paper, glass, and tea, and established a Board of Customs in Boston to more rigorously execute trade regulations. The new taxes were enacted on the belief that Americans only objected to internal taxes and not to external taxes such as custom duties. However, in his widely read pamphlet, Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, John Dickinson argued against the constitutionality of the acts because their purpose was to raise revenue and not to regulate trade. Colonists responded to the taxes by organizing new boycotts of British goods. These boycotts were less effective, however, as the goods taxed by the Townshend Acts were widely used.\n\nIn February 1768, the Assembly of Massachusetts Bay issued a circular letter to the other colonies urging them to coordinate resistance. The governor dissolved the assembly when it refused to rescind the letter. Meanwhile, a riot broke out in Boston in June 1768 over the seizure of the sloop Liberty, owned by John Hancock, for alleged smuggling. Customs officials were forced to flee, prompting the British to deploy troops to Boston. A Boston town meeting declared that no obedience was due to parliamentary laws and called for the convening of a convention. A convention assembled but only issued a mild protest before dissolving itself. In January 1769, Parliament responded to the unrest by reactivating the Treason Act 1543 which called for subjects outside the realm to face trials for treason in England. The governor of Massachusetts was instructed to collect evidence of said treason, and the threat caused widespread outrage, though it was not carried out.\n\nOn March 5, 1770, a large crowd gathered around a group of British soldiers on a Boston street. The crowd grew threatening, throwing snowballs, rocks, and debris at them. One soldier was clubbed and fell. There was no order to fire, but the soldiers panicked and fired into the crowd. They hit 11 people; three civilians died of wounds at the scene of the shooting, and two died shortly after the incident. The event quickly came to be called the Boston Massacre. The soldiers were tried and acquitted (defended by John Adams), but the widespread descriptions soon began to turn colonial sentiment against the British. This accelerated the downward spiral in the relationship between Britain and the Province of Massachusetts.\n\nA new ministry under Lord North came to power in 1770, and Parliament withdrew all taxes except the tax on tea, giving up its efforts to raise revenue while maintaining the right to tax. This temporarily resolved the crisis, and the boycott of British goods largely ceased, with only the more radical patriots such as Samuel Adams continuing to agitate.[citation needed]\n\n\nOn June 9, 1772, the Sons of Liberty burned HMS Gaspee, a British customs schooner in Narragansett Bay.\nIn June 1772, American patriots, including John Brown, burned a British warship that had been vigorously enforcing unpopular trade regulations, in what became known as the Gaspee Affair. The affair was investigated for possible treason, but no action was taken.\n\nIn 1772, it became known that the Crown intended to pay fixed salaries to the governors and judges in Massachusetts, which had been paid by local authorities. This would reduce the influence of colonial representatives over their government. Samuel Adams in Boston set about creating new Committees of Correspondence, which linked Patriots in all 13 colonies and eventually provided the framework for a rebel government. Virginia, the largest colony, set up its Committee of Correspondence in early 1773, on which Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson served.\n\nA total of about 7,000 to 8,000 Patriots served on Committees of Correspondence at the colonial and local levels, comprising most of the leadership in their communities. Loyalists were excluded. The committees became the leaders of the American resistance to British actions, and later largely determined the war effort at the state and local level. When the First Continental Congress decided to boycott British products, the colonial and local Committees took charge, examining merchant records and publishing the names of merchants who attempted to defy the boycott by importing British goods.\n\nIn 1773, private letters were published in which Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson claimed that the colonists could not enjoy all English liberties, and in which Lieutenant Governor Andrew Oliver called for the direct payment of colonial officials. The letters' contents were used as evidence of a systematic plot against American rights, and discredited Hutchinson in the eyes of the people; the colonial Assembly petitioned for his recall. Benjamin Franklin, postmaster general for the colonies, acknowledged that he leaked the letters, which led to him being berated by British officials and removed from his position.\n\n\nThe December 16, 1773 Boston Tea Party, led by Samuel Adams and Sons of Liberty, has become a mainstay of American patriotic lore.\nMeanwhile, Parliament passed the Tea Act lowering the price of taxed tea exported to the colonies, to help the British East India Company undersell smuggled untaxed Dutch tea. Special consignees were appointed to sell the tea to bypass colonial merchants. The act was opposed by those who resisted the taxes and also by smugglers who stood to lose business.[citation needed] In most instances, the consignees were forced by the Americans to resign and the tea was turned back, but Massachusetts governor Hutchinson refused to allow Boston merchants to give in to pressure. A town meeting in Boston determined that the tea would not be landed, and ignored a demand from the governor to disperse. On December 16, 1773, a group of men, led by Samuel Adams and dressed to evoke the appearance of indigenous people, boarded the ships of the East India Company and dumped \u00a310,000 worth of tea from their holds (approximately \u00a3636,000 in 2008) into Boston Harbor. Decades later, this event became known as the Boston Tea Party and remains a significant part of American patriotic lore.\n\n1774\u20131775: Intolerable Acts\nMain article: Intolerable Acts\nFurther information: Quebec Act and Continental Association\n\nA 1774 etching from The London Magazine depicts Prime Minister Lord North, author of the Boston Port Act, forcing the Intolerable Acts down the throat of America, whose arms are restrained by Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, and a tattered \"Boston Petition\" lays trampled on the ground beside her. Lord Sandwich pins down her feet and peers up her robes; behind them, Mother Britannia weeps while France and Spain look on.\nThe British government responded by passing several measures that came to be known as the Intolerable Acts, further darkening colonial opinion towards England. They consisted of four laws enacted by the British parliament. The first was the Massachusetts Government Act which altered the Massachusetts charter and restricted town meetings. The second act was the Administration of Justice Act which ordered that all British soldiers to be tried were to be arraigned in Britain, not in the colonies.

Here's a comparison between the two:\n\n**Stress**:\n- Stress refers to the internal forces that neighboring particles of a material exert on each other.\n- It is a measure of the intensity of the force per unit area within materials and is calculated as force divided by the cross-sectional area over which the force is distributed.\n- Stress can be categorized as tensile, compressive, shear, or sometimes combined, based on the nature of the internal forces acting in the material.\n- Stress is typically expressed in pascals (Pa) or megapascals (MPa) when using the International System of Units (SI).\n\nMathematically, stress (\u03c3) is given by:\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{F}{A} \\]\nwhere F is the applied force, and A is the cross-sectional area.\n\n**Strain**:\n- Strain, on the other hand, is a measure of deformation representing the displacement between particles in the material relative to a reference length.\n- Strain is a dimensionless quantity as it measures the relative change in shape or size.\n- This means that strain can be either tensile (elongation), compressive (contraction), or shear (angle change) and is often represented by Greek letters like epsilon (\u03b5) in the SI system.\n- When a material is subjected to an applied stress, it may experience strain, indicating how much the material deforms.\n- Strain is typically given as a percentage or as a dimensionless unit.\n\nMathematically, strain (\u03b5) is given by:\n\\[ \\epsilon = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L_0} \\]\nwhere \u0394L is the change in length (either elongation or compression), and \\( L_0 \\) is the original length.\n\nTo summarize, stress is an expression of the forces within a material, quantified as force per unit area. In contrast, strain is the measure of the material's deformation that results from an applied stress, expressing the relative change in shape or size as a proportion of the original dimension.\n\nWhile stress determines how much intensity force is acting inside the material, strain shows how much the material's dimensions change as a result of this stress. The relationship between stress and strain is described by Hooke\u2019s Law, which states that within the elastic limit of a material, the strain is proportional to the applied stress. This relationship can be summarized with the formula:\n\\[ \\sigma = E \\cdot \\epsilon \\]\nwhere \\( E \\) is the modulus of elasticity, a material property that quantifies its stiffness.", "shortest_response": "Stress is defined as the force applied per unit area within materials, resisting deformation from applied forces.

A significant number of historians have stated that Salamis is one of the most significant battles in human history (though the same is often stated of Marathon). In a more extreme form of this argument, some historians argue that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis, the ensuing conquest of Greece by the Persians would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as we know it. This view is based on the premise that much of modern Western society, such as philosophy, science, personal freedom and democracy are rooted in the legacy of Ancient Greece. Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the domination of much of modern history by Western Civilization, Persian domination of Greece might have changed the whole trajectory of human history. It is also worth mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential Athenian culture occurred only after the Persian wars were won.\n\nFrom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Salamis", "longest_response": "The Battle of Salamis, fought in 480 BC during the Greco-Persian Wars, is indeed considered by many historians as one of the most significant battles in human history. Here's why it holds such significance:\n\n1. **Strategic Importance**: The Persian Empire, under King Xerxes, launched a massive invasion of Greece in an attempt to conquer the Greek city-states that had proved resistant to previous Persian threats. Salamis was strategically vital because the narrow straits of Salamis provided an ideal battlefield for the Greek naval forces to counter the numerically superior Persian fleet.\n\n2. **Turning Point**: The battle marked a turning point in the Persian Wars. A decisive Greek victory at Salamis significantly weakened Persian naval power and boosted Greek morale. It forced Xerxes to retreat, leading to the eventual Greek victory at subsequent battles such as Plataea in 479 BC, effectively ending the Persian invasion.\n\n3. **Symbol of Resistance**: The battle encapsulates the determination and ingenuity of the Greek city-states. Against enormous odds and facing a mighty invader, the Greek fleet, under the strategic command of Themistocles, managed to outmaneuver and overwhelm the Persian navy.\n\n4. **Long-Term Implications**: The victory at Salamis is often cited as a pivotal moment that preserved Greek independence and paved the way for Athenian dominance. This, in turn, facilitated the flourishing of democracy, philosophy, science, and arts in the classical Greek period. Such developments profoundly influenced subsequent Western civilization. Without the Greek success at Salamis, the Persian Empire might have prevailed, possibly altering the entire trajectory of world history, particularly the rise of Western thought, culture, and governance.\n\n5. **Cultural Legacy**: The triumph at Salamis is not only seen in the historical realm but also celebrated in Greek mythology, literature, and cultural memory. It symbolizes the heroic struggle against oppression and the triumph of innovation and strategy over sheer numbers. Such narratives have continued to inspire countless generations.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the exact nature and extent of the long-term impact of the Battle of Salamis are subjects of scholarly debate. While the battle undeniably had significant short-term and long-term effects, some historians caution against over-emphasizing its role in shaping the entire course of world history. Economic, political, and social factors also played crucial roles in the development of civilizations over time. Nonetheless, most scholars recognize Salamis as one of the key battles in the defense of Greek civilization and the foundation upon which later Western cultural and intellectual achievements were built.", "shortest_response": "Yes, many historians consider the Battle of Salamis (480 BC) to be one of the most significant battles in human history. Alongside the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, Salamis has achieved legendary status due to the desperate circumstances and the seemingly insurmountable odds faced by the Greek forces. The crucial role that this naval battle played in the Greek defense against the Persian invasion of Greece lends it a particular historical importance.\n\nHistorians who emphasize the significance of Salamis argue that if the Greeks had lost, the Persians would have conquered Greece, potentially altering the course of Western civilization. This hypothetical scenario underscores the impact of the Greek resistance, as Greece is widely regarded as the cradle of Western culture, democracy, philosophy, science, and other foundational elements of modern civilization.\n\nThe Athenian Renaissance, a period of flourishing arts, philosophy, and political development, primarily flourished after the Persian Wars were concluded. Without the victory in Salamis, the trajectory of Western history might have been fundamentally different.\n\nTherefore, while some battles like the Battle of Plataea (also in 480 BC) and Marathon have their own significance, the Battle of Salamis holds a distinct and pivotal place in history for how it helped shape the trajectory of Western civilization.

He could still recall how the idea first took root when his doctor recommended traveling to Seattle for a medical procedure that promised better care than what was available in their small town. And now, here he was, nerves tingling with a mix of excitement and apprehension, about to embark on his first airplane journey.\n\nAt the security checkpoint, Liam shuffled through the thick crowd, feeling his heart pound louder with every passing moment. As he handed over his ticket and identification to a harried security officer, he caught the officer\u2019s curious glance, a flicker of anxiety in her eyes. The man seemed too young to be a flight attendant, but her attire confirmed the role. Grabbing Liam's bag hurriedly, she directed him to a small room, which she quickly exited after a hushed conversation with someone over the intercom.\n\nTen minutes later, Liam was ushered through a bustling gate, his eyes widening as towering planes loomed overhead. \"Welcome aboard,\" a polished woman in sleek uniform greeted him. \"Are you ready to fly?\"\n\nLiam blinked, staring at her. \"Excuse me?\"\n\nThe woman appeared momentarily taken aback but quickly offered a reassuring smile. \"I\u2019m sorry, sir, but could you please re-verify your boarding pass? You were recently seated.\"\n\nHer words, though friendly, hit Liam hard. Flustered, he rummaged through his meticulously packed bag, pulling out the crumpled paper receipt and presenting it to her. She scanned it, her face softening with understanding.\n\n\"Boarding in seven minutes,\" she said, placing a hand on Liam\u2019s shoulder. \"Welcome aboard.\"\n\nAs Liam scanned the bustling aircraft, he noticed a young boy playing with a toy plane, lost in the game. His mother, a tired traveler in a navy-blue suit, smiled at the boy before patting his back, her eyes betraying a depth of emotion Liam couldn\u2019t quite grasp. The boy, oblivious to his mother\u2019s struggles, looked up with sparkling curiosity.\n\n\u201cMommy, do you really fly to another world when you go on an airplane?\u201d he asked innocently, holding his toy plane more firmly.\n\nThe mom chuckled gently, \u201cYes, sweetie, we fly to see places we can\u2019t see with just our eyes.\u201d\n\nLiam nodded, still clutching a loose change from the bus fare, contemplating his own journey.\n\nAs the plane ascended, the hum of engines and the gentle hum of conversation filled the cabin. Liam chose a window seat near the front, allowing him a clear view of the sky as the plane dipped slightly, evoking an uneasy feeling of exhilaration. When turbulence hit, he squeezed his eyes shut momentarily, feeling the plane thrash violently but not panicking. He had read about turbulence, though never thought it would physically jar him.\n\nMoments later, as Liam settled into his seat, he noticed the same boy again. The boy was seated right in front of him, staring through the window, clearly lost in his own wonder at the sight of the vast expanse of sky outside.\n\nTheir eyes met, and in that brief glance, Liam felt an overwhelming urge to share something about his journey. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m going to Seattle to get better care for my health,\u201d he whispered.\n\nThe boy\u2019s eyes widened, slightly confused but intrigued. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Liam replied, feeling a pang of sadness that he had to reveal his secrets to a stranger.\n\nThe mother, who had been watching the exchange, pulled Liam toward the aisle in a few seconds. \"Excuse me, sir, can I help you with something?\"\n\n\"To the gate, please,\u201d Liam nodded, managing a grateful smile.\n\nAs he walked down the aisle, he couldn\u2019t help but ponder what he had just shared. How many other passengers, each with their own vulnerabilities? How many silent battles and unspoken hopes were carried in every flight?\n\nLiam arrived at the gate to find his mother, tears streaking her face as she grabbed her son's arm. \"Just a bit longer, love. I have to get that new medication from the hospital.\"\n\nHer trembling voice was barely audible, but Liam grasped the gravity of her words. He handed her a small, folded letter, a handwritten note expressing his deepest gratitude for her unwavering strength. She took it without a word, cradling it gently against her cheek.\n\nInside, Liam had written: \"To my mom: I am about to go on this first flight, and I\u2019ll be home before you know it. Take care, and hold on to the dreams you treasure.\"\n\nHis mother didn\u2019t let go until they were all seated on the plane again. As Liam looked back at her, he felt a familiar sadness that tugged at his heart. Despite the new life ahead, the journey couldn\u2019t erase the shared grief that bound them together in his fleeting moments among strangers.\n\nThe plane took off, soaring into the sky. Overlooking the world below, Liam found a strange sense of comfort. He had shared his story, and in that shared vulnerability, he had understood just how tightly knit their lives were. The little boy had shown him a glimpse of innocence and wonder, but Liam had also felt the weight\u2014and sometimes the weight of absence\u2014in every journey.

The airport thrummed with life as his flight to Tokyo was about to take off.\n\nAs the crowd surged around him, his eyes caught sight of an old man wiping tears from the corner of his eye. He watched, his heart squeezing painfully, as the older man clutched a worn-out photograph tightly in his hands. \"What happened?\" Alex wondered, his curiosity piqued and his hands a little shaky. Unperturbed by the stranger's emotions, Alex decided to approach, his nerves masked by an air of innocent curiosity. \n\n\"Excuse me,\" he said gently. \"I noticed your tears and just wondered if everything was okay.\" The old man, startled by the unexpected intrusion upon his grief, turned around to face Alex. He squinted under the harsh overhead lights, trying to remember if he had met this young man before. \n\nAlex could see by the man's demeanor that he carried a heavy heart, and so he asked, \"May I say something?\" The old man shook his head, not wanting to impose on anyone.

I thought I'd send him off the day before he headed out for America.\"\n\nAlex felt a pit in his stomach. He could see the old man's heart aching, and it brought him closer to tears. His grandfather Charlie had traveled the world, seeing the sights and making memories, bringing joy and happiness into the lives of others. Suddenly, Alex felt tears form on his own eyes, as he stared at the old man.\n\n\"I know this must be incredibly hard,\" he managed to say, nodding his head in understanding. \"I wish I could help somehow.\"\n\nThe old man smiled softly at Alex, tears no longer tracing down his cheeks. \"Thank you for your kindness,\" he said, squeezing Alex's hand. \"I hope I can always feel this feeling when somebody shows me such pure human kindness again.\"\n\nAs Alex watched the old man walk towards the exit, he felt a gentle tugging at his heart. In that moment, he realized that there were no magical moments, no big moments, just pure, everyday acts of kindness that made the human race so beautiful. And that would never be lost on him.

It was one of the best known Australian films of the 1960s. It was produced under the auspices of the Commonwealth Film Unit (CFU), later reincorporated as Film Australia. It was co-directed by Jack Lee and Richard (Dick) Mason, and featured Reg Livermore (in his first film role) as one of the 'narrators'.\n\nOne of the regular duties of the CFU at this time was the production of short films that were purpose-made for overseas distribution and were intended to promote Australia as an attractive destination for migrants and tourists. From the Tropics to the Snow marked a significant break with the traditional style of such features, and is noted for its subversive and satirical approach to its subject.\n\nRather than using the stilted, authoritative single-voice narration that was typical of such 'promotion documentaries' at the time, Mason and Lee opted for a strikingly reflexive approach, using a lively (and frequently tongue-in-cheek) multi-voice narration, which is introduced through the dramatic device of a production planning meeting between the film's Producer-in-Chief (Alexander Archdale), the director (Alastair Smart) and the screenwriter (Livermore). This allowed the film to become an ironic critique of itself, humorously examining the mechanics of \"documentary\" film construction, and the competing pressures and choices that faced filmmakers when creating such films. It also gently parodied Lee and Mason's own situation as \"young turks\" charged with turning out what were in essence \"production-line\" propaganda films for a hidebound government department.\n\nThe film co-won the Australian Film Institute's Gold Medal for Best Film in 1965.", "longest_response": "Yes, \"From the Tropics to the Snow\" co-won the Australian Film Institute's Gold Medal for Best Film in 1965.

This transition included going from hand production methods to machines; new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes; the increasing use of water power and steam power; the development of machine tools; and the rise of the mechanized factory system. Output greatly increased, and a result was an unprecedented rise in population and in the rate of population growth. The textile industry was the first to use modern production methods,\u200a and textiles became the dominant industry in terms of employment, value of output, and capital invested.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, and many of the technological and architectural innovations were of British origin. By the mid-18th century, Britain was the world's leading commercial nation, controlling a global trading empire with colonies in North America and the Caribbean. Britain had major military and political hegemony on the Indian subcontinent; particularly with the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal, through the activities of the East India Company. The development of trade and the rise of business were among the major causes of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in history. Comparable only to humanity's adoption of agriculture with respect to material advancement, the Industrial Revolution influenced in some way almost every aspect of daily life. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. Some economists have said the most important effect of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population in the Western world began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries. GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy, while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies. Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in human history since the domestication of animals and plants.\n\nThe precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and social changes.Eric Hobsbawm held that the Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s, while T. S. Ashton held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830.Rapid industrialisation first began in Britain, starting with mechanized textiles spinning in the 1780s, with high rates of growth in steam power and iron production occurring after 1800. Mechanized textile production spread from Great Britain to continental Europe and the United States in the early 19th century, with important centres of textiles, iron and coal emerging in Belgium and the United States and later textiles in France.\n\nAn economic recession occurred from the late 1830s to the early 1840s when the adoption of the Industrial Revolution's early innovations, such as mechanized spinning and weaving, slowed and their markets matured. Innovations developed late in the period, such as the increasing adoption of locomotives, steamboats and steamships, and hot blast iron smelting. New technologies such as the electrical telegraph, widely introduced in the 1840s and 1850s, were not powerful enough to drive high rates of growth. Rapid economic growth began to occur after 1870, springing from a new group of innovations in what has been called the Second Industrial Revolution. These innovations included new steel making processes, mass production, assembly lines, electrical grid systems, the large-scale manufacture of machine tools, and the use of increasingly advanced machinery in steam-powered factories", "longest_response": "The Industrial Revolution was a transformative period from approximately 1760 to 1840, marked by the shift from hand production methods to mechanized processes in Great Britain, Europe, and the United States.

Originating in Great Britain, the revolution saw unprecedented population growth and a significant rise in output, particularly in the textile industry. It spanned from roughly 1760 to 1830, with key developments in steam and iron production following 1800.

Here are some methods and tips for different ways to cook a steak:\n\n1. **Pan-Seared Steak**:\n   - **Preparation**: Take a high-quality cut of meat such as ribeye, filet mignon, or New York strip. Season with salt and pepper.\n   - **Cook**: Heat a heavy skillet (cast iron or stainless steel) over high heat until very hot. Add your steak, sear for 2-3 minutes on each side for medium-rare (about 120-125\u00b0F or 50-50\u00b0C).\n   - **Finish**: Transfer to an oven preheated to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 5-8 minutes to reach desired doneness. Let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing.\n\n2. **Broiled Steak**:\n   - **Preparation**: Use a well-seasoned cut of steak.\n   - **Cook**: Preheat the broiler. Place the steak on a broiler pan and broil in an oven at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Check the steak for desired doneness frequently (around 5-6 minutes per side for medium-rare).\n   - **Finish**: Move the steak to a lower rack in the oven for a couple of minutes until desired doneness is reached. Let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing.\n\n3. **Grilled Steak**:\n   - **Preparation**: Season the steak with olive oil, salt, and pepper. \n   - **Cook**: Preheat your grill to high heat. Grill the steak for 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare.\n   - **Finish**: Move the steak to a cooler part of the grill for a few minutes if needed to reach desired doneness. Let it rest before slicing.\n\n4. **Smoke-Grilled Steak**:\n   - **Preparation**: Season steak with salt, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil.\n   - **Cook**: Preheat the grill to high heat. Place the steak directly on the grill grates. Cook for about 4-5 minutes per side.\n   - **Finish**: Let the steak rest for about 10 minutes before slicing. \n\n5. **Sous Vide Steak**:\n   - **Preparation**: Season the steak with salt, pepper, and any other preferred spices. Place it in a vacuum-sealed bag.\n   - **Cook**: Submerge the bag in a water bath using a sous vide cooker and set the temperature to the desired doneness (e.g., 130\u00b0F for medium-rare).\n   - **Finish**: Remove the steak from the bag and quickly sear it in a hot skillet for about 1-2 minutes per side for a crust. Rest it for 5 minutes before slicing.\n\n6. **Barbecued Steak**:\n   - **Preparation**: Brush the steak with a marinade made from olive oil, vinegar, garlic, and herbs.\n   - **Cook**: Preheat your smoker to 225-250\u00b0F (107-121\u00b0C). Cook the steak for 2-3 hours until it reaches desired doneness. For thicker cuts, add water to the smoker to ensure the internal temperature reaches the desired level.\n   - **Finish**: Let the steak rest for 20-30 minutes before slicing.\n\nRemember to adjust cooking times according to the thickness of your steak and desired doneness. For achieving perfect results, make sure your steak reaches an internal temperature that matches your preferred doneness (e.g., 125\u00b0F for medium-rare, 135\u00b0F for medium). Allow the steak to rest before slicing to ensure juiciness and flavor. Enjoy your cooking!", "shortest_response": "There are numerous ways to cook a steak, each resulting in a unique flavor and texture. Here are some popular methods you can consider:\n\n1. Pan-searing: Heat a skillet with oil and sear the steak on all sides until it is browned. This method produces a juicy steak with a crispy crust. Add a tablespoon of butter, garlic, or herbs between coats of heavy cream for enhanced flavor.\n\n2. Grilling: Cook the steak on a grill, either over direct heat or using indirect heat. You can grill the steak on high heat for a quick sear, then move to indirect heat to finish cooking. Remember to oil the grates to avoid sticking.\n\n3. Sous-vide: Preheat a sous-vide water bath to your desired temperature (e.g., 129\u00b0F for medium-rare) and cook the steak in a vacuum-sealed plastic bag for a few hours. This method offers a precise, evenly cooked steak.\n\n4. Broiling: Place the steak on a broiler pan and cook under direct heat. It has a shorter cooking time compared to grilling and searing, and it results in nicely charred edges.\n\n5. Frying: Deep-fry the steak in oil (such as clarified butter, bacon fat, or vegetable oil) until it's golden and crispy. Frying can create a crunchy exterior, but it also requires careful attention to ensure the steak doesn't overcook.\n\n6. Ovens: Cook the steak in an oven at high temperature (e.g., 400\u00b0F) for a crispy and juicy finish. Use a cast-iron skillet on a rack inside the oven to sear the steak and achieve a caramelized crust.\n\n7. Steaming: Steamed steak can be enjoyed, but it's less common than other methods. You can wrap the steak in foil with some liquid, such as wine or broth, and steam it until it reaches your desired doneness.\n\n8. Poaching: Submerge the steak in a flavorful liquid, such as broth, wine, or vinegar with aromatics like thyme, bay leaves, or ginger. Steach it gently until it tenderizes and absorbs the flavors. Poached steak can be seasoned after removing it from the liquid.\n\nRemember to pay attention to the doneness of your steak, as well as any marinating or seasoning you may want to apply.

Dependent communist governments were installed in the Eastern Bloc satellite states. After becoming the world's second nuclear power, the Soviet Union established the Warsaw Pact alliance, and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the Cold War, with the rivaling United States and NATO. After Stalin's death in 1953 and a short period of collective rule, the new leader Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin and launched the policy of de-Stalinization, releasing many political prisoners from the Gulag labor camps. The general easement of repressive policies became known later as the Khrushchev Thaw. At the same time, Cold War tensions reached its peak when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the United States Jupiter missiles in Turkey and Soviet missiles in Cuba.\n\nIn 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, thus starting the Space Age. Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit the Earth, aboard the Vostok 1 manned spacecraft on 12 April 1961. Following the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, another period of collective rule ensued, until Leonid Brezhnev became the leader. The era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was later designated as the Era of Stagnation. The 1965 Kosygin reform aimed for partial decentralisation of the Soviet economy. In 1979, after a communist-led revolution in Afghanistan, Soviet forces invaded the country, ultimately starting the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. In May 1988, the Soviets started to withdraw from Afghanistan, due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens.\n\nFrom 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in an attempt to end the period of economic stagnation and to democratise the government. This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements across the country. Prior to 1991, the Soviet economy was the world's second-largest, but during its final years, it went into a crisis.\n\nBy 1991, economic and political turmoil began to boil over as the Baltic states chose to secede from the Soviet Union. On 17 March, a referendum was held, in which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into a renewed federation. In June 1991, Boris Yeltsin became the first directly elected president in Russian history when he was elected president of the Russian SFSR. In August 1991, a coup d'\u00e9tat attempt by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led to the end of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. On 25 December 1991, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, along with contemporary Russia, fourteen other post-Soviet states emerged.", "longest_response": "The Soviets pulled out of their war in Afghanistan for several key reasons, as indicated in the provided context:\n\n1. **International Opposition:** The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 drew significant worldwide condemnation. Numerous countries, particularly Western powers, were vocally opposed to the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. This international pressure increased over time, leading to a wide array of sanctions and political isolation for the Soviet Union.\n\n2. **Anti-Soviet Guerrilla Warfare:** The mujahideen, a group of Afghan resistance fighters, conducted persistent and effective guerrilla warfare against Soviet forces. This resistance greatly stretched Soviet military resources and morale. The sustained conflict and high casualties significantly undermined the Soviet Union\u2019s ability to maintain its military campaign in Afghanistan.\n\n3. **Lack of Support from Soviet Citizens:** The anti-war sentiment grew significantly among the Soviet populace. As the war dragged on, it became increasingly unpopular among Soviet citizens. The immense human and economic costs began to weigh heavily, leading to discontent and reduced morale within the country.\n\n4. **Economic and Political Deterioration:** By the late 1980s, the Soviet Union was already experiencing severe economic challenges and political instability. The costs associated with the Afghan war compounded these issues, further straining the already struggling Soviet economy and contributing to the broader political instability. Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s policies aimed at reforming the Soviet system exacerbated the situation by accelerating political liberalization and revealing deep-seated systemic problems.\n\n5. **Strategic Reevaluation:** Following the failed coup attempt in August 1991 by hardliners within the Soviet establishment, Gorbachev\u2019s administration recognized that maintaining control over the Afghan war was untenable in the face of growing internal dissent and severe external opposition. A strategic decision to withdraw began in 1988 was aimed at preserving what remnants of the Soviet Union remaining forces as the Soviet Union itself was disintegrating.\n\nThese factors combined to create an environment where continuing the war in Afghanistan was no longer feasible, leading to the Soviet withdrawal in May 1988. The end of the war reflected broader systemic issues that ultimately contributed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union later that year.", "shortest_response": "The Soviets pulled out of the war in Afghanistan in 1988 due to a combination of factors: international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens.

Here are some of the primary causes:\n\n1. **Speculation and Excessive Risk-Taking**: During the 1920s, many investors engaged in speculative investments, buying stocks on margin, or with borrowed money. The margin trading practice allowed investors to buy more stock than they could afford, significantly magnifying potential losses. When stock values began to decline, margin calls demanded that investors pay back their loans, further accelerating the downward spiral.\n\n2. **Overvaluation of Stocks**: Valuations in the stock market were highly inflated. Many companies were trading on shaky financial foundations, yet stock prices were elevated due to irrational exuberance and the belief that the market would continue to grow indefinitely. When investors started to recognize these unsustainable valuations, panic ensued.\n\n3. **Economic Imbalances and Declining Growth**: The 1920s experienced some economic prosperity, but it was unevenly distributed. Credit was broadly available even to those who couldn\u2019t afford to borrow it, creating a speculative bubble. Contributing to the instability were weaknesses in the banking system, high tariffs (like the Smoot-Hawley Tariff), overreliance on consumer credit, and uneven economic growth.\n\n4. **Drought and the Dust Bowl**: The Midwest experienced severe droughts and dust storms during the 1930s. The Dust Bowl, in particular, led to the loss of crops and livestock, devastating agriculture and rural economies, and exacerbating the Great Depression.\n\n5. **Bank Failures**: As the stock market crashed, banks and brokerage firms began to fail in unprecedented numbers. Since many had invested heavily in stocks or loaned money to speculators, their solvency was threatened. The ensuing wave of bank failures caused a contraction in the money supply, which further depressed economic activity.\n\n6. **Reduction in Consumer Spending and Confidence**: The crash of the stock market severely impacted consumer confidence. As people saw their wealth shrink or become uncertain, they cut back on spending, leading to a decline in demand for goods and services. This cycle reduced revenues for businesses, leading to layoffs, more bankruptcies, and further declines in consumer sentiment.\n\n7. **Lack of Regulation**: The financial markets of the 1920s were poorly regulated, allowing for unscrupulous practices and the accumulation of risk in the financial system. There were insufficient financial safeguards to prevent widespread panic or to stabilize the market when a crisis occurred.\n\n8. **International Trade Issues**: Tariff policies, such as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, exacerbated global economic problems by reducing international trade, causing a worldwide decline in economic activity contributing to the economic collapse in the United States.\n\nThese factors interplayed to create a perfect storm, leading to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. It was a complex event with deep-rooted causes that collectively unraveled the fragile economic conditions of the time.", "shortest_response": "The 1929 US stock market crash, also known as Black Thursday, led to the Great Depression and was the result of a combination of factors, including:\n\n\n1. **Speculation**: Many investors bought stocks on margin, meaning they paid only a fraction of the stock price and borrowed the rest. This led to inflated stock prices and an unsustainable bubble.\n\n\n2. **Overproduction**: The 1920s saw an increase in production, yet consumption did not keep pace, leading to overproduction and falling prices, which negatively impacted investors.\n\n\n3. **Uneven Economic Growth**: The 1920s saw significant economic growth but unevenly distributed wealth, with a gap between the rich and the poor, which eventually affected consumer spending.\n\n\n4. **Bank Failures**: As the market crashed, people rushed to withdraw their savings, resulting in bank failures when banks could not cover the withdrawals.\n\n\n5. **Lack of Regulation**: There was a lack of oversight or regulatory mechanisms within the stock markets, which allowed risky financial practices to go unchecked.\n\n\n6. **Overvalued Stocks**: Many stocks were overvalued, and the prices did not reflect the company's underlying value.\n\n\nThese factors combined to create a perfect storm, leading to the catastrophic collapse of the stock market and the subsequent Great Depression.", "input_size": 19, "output_sizes": [511, 576, 517, 459, 620, 268, 428, 603, 500, 526], "output_mean": 500.8, "output_std": 96.2, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 469.25, "p50": 514.0, "p75": 563.5, "p99": 618.47}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "open_qa", "gen_time": 12.50619}, {"sample_id": "bd4b85e7b36e4d1e", "prompt_id": "2daf46e1f5c9211a", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Given this paragraph on French Revolution, what were the main causes\nContext: The French Revolution (French: R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise [\u0281ev\u0254lysj\u0254\u0303 f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b\u02d0z]) was a period of radical political and societal change in France that began with the Estates General of 1789 and ended with the formation of the French Consulate in November 1799.

Key triggers included:\n\n1. **Social Distress**: The rigid class system created deep-seated discontent, especially among the peasants, middle class (bourgeoisie), and urban workers, who were all strained by poverty, lack of political power, and oppression.\n\n2. **Political Inequality**: The Estates General's lack of representative balance and the exclusion of the Third Estate from meaningful political power led to demands for a more equitable representation and governance.\n\n3. **Economic Hardship**: France faced significant financial crises due to debt from expensive wars (such as the American Revolution and wars on the Italian and Austrian fronts). Rising bread prices, poor harvests, and heavy taxation further exacerbated the suffering of common people.\n\n4. **Enlightenment Ideals**: The enlightenment era brought about new ideas about liberty, equality, and fraternity, which inspired revolutionary thoughts and provided intellectual fuel for the demands for change.\n\n5. **Ineffectiveness of the Monarchy**: Poor leadership and inability of King Louis XVI to address the nation's financial and social issues increased frustration and disillusionment with the royal family.\n\n6. **Events Leading to the Assembly**: The convocation of the Estates General in May 1789 and its evolution into a National Assembly by June, along with crucial moments like the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, symbolized the shift from mere grievances to active rebellion and radical transformation.\n\nThese combined factors created a powerful environment ripe for revolution, ultimately resulting in the formation of the French Consulate in November 1799.", "shortest_response": "The main causes of the French Revolution were a combination of social, political, and economic factors.

They can become a nuisance at public gatherings or in places where they cause disturbances.\n\n3. **Health Concerns**: Pigeons can carry and spread diseases like enteritis (caused by Salmonella), which can pose health risks to humans, especially to children and the elderly.\n\n4. **Messiness Around Roosting Areas**: Pigeons often congregate in large numbers in roosting areas, which can lead to significant littering and cleanliness issues for nearby businesses or public places.\n\n5. **Mold and Foul Odors**: Crowded pigeon flocks can contribute to unpleasant smells and mold growth, particularly when they roost in places like old buildings or under benches and bridges.\n\n6. **Grooming Habits**: Pigeons often spend a lot of time preening and have very messy feathers, which can attract dirt and debris. This can be unappealing for people who dislike looking at or near dirty birds.\n\n7. **Conflict with Other Birds**: Pigeons can drive away or compete with other bird species, upsetting natural balances and disturbing those who enjoy watching or interacting with a diverse bird population.\n\nPersonal tastes and experiences can heavily influence whether someone likes or dislikes pigeons. Some may have developed a negative perception based on past encounters or general discomfort with their habits.", "shortest_response": "Many people do not like pigeons for several reasons, often related to cultural, health, and cleanliness factors. Here are some common reasons:\n\n1. **Messiness**: Pigeons are often seen as dirty birds. They roost in large groups in urban areas, leaving behind droppings and debris, which can create unpleasant sights and contribute to urban cleanliness issues.\n\n2. **Aggressive Behavior**: Pigeons can sometimes exhibit aggressive behavior, especially when they feel threatened or when their nesting sites are disturbed.\n\n3. **Disease and Health Concerns**: Pigeon roosting in large colonies can contribute to the spread of diseases, such as histoplasmosis, which humans can inhale from their droppings.\n\n4. **Taste**: The taste of pigeon meat can be off-putting to some people, making them dislike the idea of eating pigeons.\n\n5. **Fear and Phobia**: Some people simply have a phobia of birds, known as ornithophobia, which could extend to pigeons specifically.\n\n6. **Historical Misconceptions**: There are cultural myths and legends from various societies where pigeons are depicted negatively, contributing to a general disdain among some people.\n\nThese reasons combined contribute to why many people do not like pigeons.

Here are five ways that 5G networks can be considered better than cloud solutions in specific contexts:\n\n1. **Low Latency for Real-Time Applications**:\n   - **5G Advantage**: 5G networks are designed to have extremely low latency, sometimes as low as 1 millisecond. This makes them ideal for real-time applications such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), gaming, and internet of things (IoT) devices that require immediate data processing and response.\n   - **Cloud Limitation**: Cloud services generally have higher latency, which can be a drawback for applications needing instant feedback.\n\n2. **Uninterrupted Experience during Network Outages**:\n   - **5G Advantage**: 5G networks in areas with strong coverage can provide a stable and continuous connection, unaffected by cloud server issues. It can be crucial for applications that require consistent connectivity regardless of global events impacting cloud infrastructures.\n   - **Cloud Limitation**: Cloud services can experience outages due to server issues, which can disrupt internet-based activities.\n\n3. **Data Efficiency and Cost for IoT**:\n   - **5G Advantage**: 5G networks are particularly efficient with IoT devices due to their ability to handle massive amounts of data with less energy. This efficiency reduces costs and energy consumption for IoT applications spread across large geographic areas.\n   - **Cloud Limitation**: Cloud services may incur higher data transfer and storage costs for IoT scenarios, especially in remote locations with less reliable connectivity.\n\n4. **Decentralized Applications (DApps)**:\n   - **5G Advantage**: The edge computing capabilities of 5G networks allow for decentralization of applications closer to the user. This can create a more seamless and interactive user experience for decentralized applications such as blockchain-based services.\n   - **Cloud Limitation**: Cloud services require centralized cloud locations, which can slow down transaction times and impact the overall user experience for DApps.\n\n5. **Enhanced Mobile Experience for Entertainment and Social Media**:\n   - **5G Advantage**: 5G offers significantly higher data speeds and better bandwidth, which enhances the quality of streaming, gaming, and social media experiences. High-definition content, 4K/8K video streaming, and seamless mobile gaming become more feasible and enjoyable.\n   - **Cloud Limitation**: Cloud services often rely on the internet connection quality, which may not always support the high data needs required for optimal multimedia experiences on mobile devices.\n\nIt's important to note that many of these advantages of 5G can be complemented or even augmented by cloud services.

Local Storage: Pre-installed computing allows for local storage of data, which can be faster, more reliable, and more secure. In contrast, cloud computing relies on remote servers, which can sometimes result in slower or intermittent access to data.\n\n2. Customization: With pre-installed computing, users have the ability to tailor their systems and software to their specific requirements, while cloud computing is typically a \"one size fits all\" approach that may not be perfectly suited to every user's needs.\n\n3. Network Dependency: Pre-installed computing does not require a high-speed internet connection, which can be useful in areas with poor connectivity or for users who rely on public Wi-Fi.\n\n4. Privacy: Pre-installed computing can offer a greater degree of privacy compared to cloud computing, which often relies on third-party services and companies to handle and store user data. Users can have more direct control over their data with pre-installed computing.\n\n5. Cost: Cloud computing typically involves recurring subscription costs, which can add up over time.

Today, I\u2019m gonna share some super fun tips on how to remember all those lines for your school musical play. Trust me, it'll become second nature before you know it! So, let\u2019s get started!\n\n1. **Make it Interesting:**\n   Hey, your lines might feel a bit boring, but guess what? You can totally make them interesting! Picture the scene in your mind. Use funny voices and act it out with your friends. You\u2019ll be surprised at how much you remember by pretending you're really in the story.\n\n2. **Break it Down:**\n   Trying to memorize all those lines at once can be a bit scary, right? But don\u2019t worry! Break them into smaller sections. Memorize one scene or a couple of lines at a time. Treat it like a game, and you\u2019ll get through it faster and more smoothly.\n\n3. **Teach a Puppy:**\n   Ever taught a puppy new tricks? It\u2019s just like that! Stand up and act out each line like you\u2019re teaching it to someone who just came from nowhere. Make it clear and practice often. The more you repeat and act it out, the more you\u2019ll remember it.\n\n4. **Sing Along:**\n   Sometimes it\u2019s easier to remember lines if they\u2019re set to music or rhymes. Find a catchy tune or create a little jingle. Sing along with your classmates or even the whole audience, and keep the rhythm going. Before you know it, the words will stick!\n\n5. **Use Chew Gum:**\n   Weird tip, right? I know, but chewing gum while studying can actually help! It keeps your mouth busy and reduces talking out loud, which gives your brain a chance to really focus when practicing your lines.\n\n6. **Visualize the Characters:**\n   Imagine who each character is like. Are they brave, silly, or super smart? Knowing this helps you get into the character, and when you feel like them, it\u2019s easier to remember their lines.\n\n7. **Stay Hydrated and Rested:**\n   Taking breaks and staying hydrated are super important! Drink plenty of water and get enough sleep. A fresh mind is super helpful when trying to memorize lines. Plus, munching on some healthy snacks can keep you energized.\n\n8. **Have Fun!**\n   Remember, everyone\u2019s doing this together. Have fun with rehearsals and enjoy the silly parts! Being happy and having a good time makes it easier to remember.\n\n9. **Practice with Friends:**\n   Rehearsing with friends is the best way to practice. Give each other high fives and cheer each other on during practice runs. Working together makes everyone feel more confident.\n\n10. **Be Confident:**\n   Believe in yourself! You can do it, you\u2019ve trained for this. Stand tall, take a deep breath, and go for it! Everyone deserves a good applause.\n\nNow go out there and shine, kids! You\u2019ve got this!

Just listen to the song and sing along. Rhyme makes it easier to remember!\n\n2. **Break It Down**: Split your song into smaller sections. Take it one line at a time, and practice those bits before you try the whole thing at once. \n\n3. **Use Repetition**: Repetition is your best friend. The more you sing it, the better you'll remember it. Try practicing every day, even if it's just for five minutes.\n\n4. **Sing it Aloud in the Car or with Friends**: Singing your lines out loud while on the bus, while you're walking, or even with friends can really help you remember them.\n\n5. **Watch or Listen to the Play**: Watching others perform can help you get a feel for when and how to say the words. Plus, it's really fun to see others performing!\n\n6. **Use a Recording Device**: Try recording yourself singing the song. Listen back and see how you do. It\u2019ll remind you of what you need to work on.\n\n7. **Get Physical**: Put some energy into it! Acting and singing the lines while incorporating some dance moves or gestures can help you remember better.\n\n8. **Don't Worry About Perfecting It First**: Focus on getting the lines right at first. It's totally okay to make mistakes until you nail it!\n\n9. **Study with a Partner**: Practice with a friend and work together on remembering the lines. You can help each other and have a good laugh along the way.\n\n10. **Stay Positive and Have Fun**: Remember, this is all for fun.

A bond is essentially a contract between the lender and borrower. In exchange for the loaned capital, the borrower promises to pay interest to the lender at a specified rate and to return the original principal at a specified date, known as maturity.\n\nbonds come in various forms, with terms and features that provide investors with a range of investment options and levels of risk. Popular types of bonds include corporate bonds, municipal bonds, treasury bonds, and government bonds. The rate of interest you will earn from holding a bond is called the \"coupon rate.\"\n\nWhen you purchase a bond, you are essentially lending money to the issuer, in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the bond's face value when the bond matures. In some cases, a bond may trade at a price above or below its face value, depending on interest rate changes and other factors.\n\nThe difference between the bond's purchase price and its face value is called the bond's \"discount\" or \"premium.\" The issuer must pay interest to the borrower (bondholder) throughout the life of the bond during the period between the times of purchase.\n\nWhen interest rates rise, bond prices tend to fall and vice versa, which means a bond will be worth more or less to the holder. Some bonds are also callable, meaning the issuer may choose to repay the bond before its maturity date, usually at a certain date and at a penalty fee to the lender.\n\nTo summarize, a bond is a secure and relatively low-risk investment for most people that allows them to earn regular interest income and the full return of their initial investment when the bond matures.

These inscriptions were created by pressing the stylus into the clay to leave a mark, allowing the writing to be impressed or incised when the clay dried. Over time, cuneiform evolved to encompass a wide range of languages and uses, such as economic records, legal documents, religious texts, and historical accounts. It remained in use for centuries, eventually giving way to other writing systems like the alphabetic Egyptian hieroglyphs and the Aramaic script.", "input_size": 9, "output_sizes": [189, 319, 293, 240, 293, 170, 224, 272, 214, 244], "output_mean": 245.8, "output_std": 45.82, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 216.5, "p50": 242.0, "p75": 287.75, "p99": 316.66}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 6.39075}, {"sample_id": "1aa8558a775debff", "prompt_id": "5a38d7edca1969ab", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Do aliens exist?", "longest_response": "The question of whether aliens exist is a subject of ongoing debate and research, and remains speculative as there is no conclusive evidence either supporting or disproving the existence of extraterrestrial life.\n\nTo date, despite extensive searches using various methods, no definitive proof of extraterrestrial life has been discovered.

It is the second longest-lived radioisotope of iodine, after iodine-129.\nIts half-life is 59.49 days and it decays by electron capture to an excited state of tellurium-125. This state is not the metastable 125mTe, but rather a lower energy state that decays immediately by gamma decay with a maximum energy of 35 keV. Some of the excess energy of the excited 125Te may be internally converted ejected electrons (also at 35 keV), or to x-rays (from electron bremsstrahlung), and also a total of 21 Auger electrons, which are produced at the low energies of 50 to 500 electron volts. Eventually, stable ground state 125Te is produced as the final decay product.\nIn medical applications, the internal conversion and Auger electrons cause little damage outside the cell which contains the isotope atom. The X-rays and gamma rays are of low enough energy to deliver a higher radiation dose selectively to nearby tissues, in \"permanent\" brachytherapy where the isotope capsules are left in place (125I competes with palladium-103 in such uses)\nBecause of its relatively long half-life and emission of low-energy photons which can be detected by gamma-counter crystal detectors, 125I is a preferred isotope for tagging antibodies in radioimmunoassay and other gamma-counting procedures involving proteins outside the body. The same properties of the isotope make it useful for brachytherapy, and for certain nuclear medicine scanning procedures, in which it is attached to proteins (albumin or fibrinogen), and where a half-life longer than that provided by 123I is required for diagnostic or lab tests lasting several days.\nIodine-125 can be used in scanning/imaging the thyroid, but iodine-123 is preferred for this purpose, due to better radiation penetration and shorter half-life (13 hours). 125I is useful for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) testing in the diagnosis or monitoring of patients with kidney disease. Iodine-125 is used therapeutically in brachytherapy treatments of tumors.

There are several reasons why so many people live along coastlines:\n\n1. **Historical Reasons**: Coastal areas have historically been centers of trade, commerce, and cultural exchange. Coastal cities often developed as ports where goods from far-off lands could be easily transported via ships. These areas became hubs of economic activity, attracting more people to work in trade, fishing, and other maritime-related occupations.\n\n2. **Resources and Food Supply**: Coastal areas often provide rich fishing grounds, which have supported human populations for thousands of years. Access to seafood and other marine products has been a vital food source for coastal communities.\n\n3. **Navigation and Transportation**: Coasts offer natural harbors and bays that have been critical for navigation and transportation. Ships can anchor easily, making it easier to offload cargo and people. This facilitated the development and growth of coastal areas through trade and connectivity with other regions.\n\n4. **Tourism and Recreation**: In recent times, coastal areas have become popular tourist destinations due to their beautiful beaches, scenic views, and recreational opportunities like boating, swimming, and fishing. Tourism can provide significant economic benefits and contribute to the population growth in coastal areas.\n\n5. **Economic Opportunities**: Coastal zones are often sites of significant economic activity, particularly in sectors such as shipping, maritime industries, seafood processing, port logistics, and, more recently, renewable energy (e.g., wind and tidal) industries. These economic opportunities can attract and retain people.\n\n6. **Safety and Defenses**: In ancient times, coastal areas provided natural defenses against invaders. Ports and harbors could be easily fortified against attacks, and coastal communities were often shielded by seas or oceans. While this is less relevant today, the early advantages have had a lasting impact.\n\n7. **Climate and Environment**: Coastal areas often have milder climates compared to inland areas, which can be more appealing to live in. The maritime influence can lead to less extreme weather and more stable temperatures.\n\n8. **Cultural and Community Factors**: For some people, coastal living provides a sense of community, family heritage, and cultural identity tied to the sea. Many coastal communities have rich traditions and a way of life that attracts people with similar values and lifestyles.\n\nWhile coastal living offers numerous advantages, it's important to note that it also poses significant challenges, such as higher risks from sea-level rise, storm surges, and other climate-related issues. As a result, many coastal areas are also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which is a growing concern for policymakers and residents alike.", "shortest_response": "Coastlines have historically been hubs of human settlement for several reasons. First and foremost, rivers and coastal waters have been vital for food and transportation, providing rich fishing grounds and a means to travel and trade over long distances. Proximity to the sea has offered access to these crucial resources.\n\nFurther, coastal areas offer the unique advantage of moderating climates due to the constant movement of water. Sea breezes can make temperatures more bearable, especially in areas that would otherwise face extreme weather. Additionally, coastal regions often have fertile land due to sediment deposits from rivers and waves, making them suitable for agriculture.\n\nEconomic opportunities have also played a significant role, with ports and harbors becoming central to global trade, boosting local economies. Over time, these advantages have attracted more people, leading to thriving communities.\n\nModern infrastructure developments like airports and better road systems have further solidified coastlines as attractive places to live, not just for historical reasons but also for their continued economic and lifestyle benefits.", "input_size": 13, "output_sizes": [429, 372, 405, 376, 198, 346, 446, 386, 551, 431], "output_mean": 394.0, "output_std": 84.65, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 373.0, "p50": 395.5, "p75": 430.5, "p99": 541.55}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 10.97109}, {"sample_id": "165634512954313b", "prompt_id": "f705eedc7d0f7330", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What is the difference between blanc de noirs and blanc de blancs champagne?", "longest_response": "Blanc de noirs (also known as blanc de noirs de sable) and blanc de blancs (also known as blanc de blanc de neige) are high-quality sparkling wines from Champagne, France.

These grapes are fermented darker to produce a red or ros\u00e9 wine which is then blended and re-fermented with a base wine to achieve a final white color.\n\n3. **Process**:\n   - The red must (the grape juice) is harvested, fermented for the secondary fermentation (which produces carbon dioxide for bubbles), and then repurified to get white in color.\n\n4. **Flavor**:\n   - This champagne typically has more fruit-forward, complex fruit flavors, with hints of red fruit and higher tannin levels. It's usually more textured and sometimes has a more pronounced aroma due to the red grape components.\n\n5. **Usage**:\n   - These are less commonly available and are often reserved for specific tasting notes or unique celebrations.\n\n### Blanc de Blancs de Neige (Blanc de Blancs)\n\n1. **Name Translation**:\n   - \"Blanc de blancs\" translates directly to \"white of white grapes.\"\n\n2. **Base Wine**:\n   - Made purely from white grape varietals such as Chardonnay, Pinot blanc, and occasionally Pinot gris. The grapes are harvested early and quickly chilled to preserve their freshness.\n\n3. **Process**:\n   - Chaptalization, which is the addition of sugar to the grape must, may be done. The secondary fermentation takes place in the Champagne bottle, producing carbonation and developing the characteristic bubbles.\n\n4. **Flavor**:\n   - Blanc de blancs generally have floral, citrusy, and sometimes tropical fruit flavors, along with a distinct minerality. They're lighter and often more delicate than their black grape counterpart.\n\n5. **Usage**:\n   - More traditional and frequently available. They can pair well with a variety of foods and are often chosen for everyday celebrations and general table use.\n\n### Summary\n- **Blanc de Noirs de Sable** uses red grapes blended with base white wine.\n- **Blanc de Blancs de Neige** is made entirely from white grape varietals.\n\nThe choice between the two depends on personal preference and the specific celebratory context. Blanc de blancs is more common and easily accessible, while Blanc de noirs de sable is rarer and often reserved for special occasions or tasting events.", "shortest_response": "Blanc de noirs and Blanc de blancs are both types of sparkling wines made using different fermentation methods. Blanc de noirs, also known simply as red Champagne, utilizes the traditional method of fermentation that typically gives it red to bluish tones. The process begins with red grapes that have been crushed and fermented with their skins, allowing complex flavors and red color to develop. Some vintages may naturally take on a red hue as well. These wines are generally found in the Loire region or other areas where red grapes are used.\n\nBlanc de blancs, on the other hand, is traditional Champagne created specifically from white grapes using the standard method in the Champagne region. It is fully carbonated and offers a lighter taste, with a focus on the purity and complexity of the white grape varieties, often displaying floral and citrus notes.\n\nIn summary, the primary difference lies in the grape variety and fermentation technique: Blanc de noirs involves fermented red grapes, while Blanc de blancs is produced from white grapes.

The area saw the emergence of local kingdoms and settlements.\n- **Straits of Singapore (14th to 16th centuries):** The area was strategically significant for trading routes between India and China, known as the Spice Route or the Maritime Silk Road.\n\n**2. Colonial Era:**\n- **Dutch Colonization (16th to early 19th century):** The Dutch East India Company established a trading post in Singapore in 1592, giving it the name \"Staten Geest,\" or \"The City of Spirits.\"\n- **British Influence (18th to 19th centuries):** The Dutch ceded sovereignty to the British in 1819 following the Napoleonic Wars. The British established Singapore as a Crown Colony in 1824, recognizing its potential as a key trading hub.\n- **19th Century Trade Boom:** Singapore developed into one of the world's busiest ports due to the British East India Company's monopolistic trade of tea from China, and later rubber and tin. The infrastructure expanded rapidly to support this growth.\n\n**3. World War II and the Japanese Occupation:**\n- **Japanese Occupation (1942-1945):** During World War II, Singapore fell to the Japanese forces in February 1942 after a series of battles and sieges. The occupation was brutal, resulting in significant human suffering and loss of life.\n\n**4. Post-War Period:**\n- **Merger with Malaya (1963):** In 1963, Singapore merged with Malaya, North Borneo (now Sabah), Sarawak, and Singapore to form the Federation of Malaysia. This merger, however, was short-lived due to political disagreements, leading to Singapore's expulsion in 1965.\n- **Declaration of Independence (1965):** Singapore gained full independence on August 9, 1965, under the leadership of its first Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew.\n\n**5.

Regulate soil temperature: Mulch can prevent weeds from growing by slowing down the growth of weeds. It also helps to prevent weeds from flowering and produce seeds. A thick layer of mulch of 2 to 4 inches will effectively block out sunlight from reaching the soil.\n\n2. Control erosion: Mulch can help prevent erosion by protecting the soil from the impact of wind and rain, and by reducing runoff from the surface.\n\n3. Retain soil moisture: Mulch can help retain soil moisture by increasing the water-holding capacity of the soil. This is especially important in areas with low rainfall, or during periods of drought.\n\n4. Provide nutrients: Mulch can help to break down and add valuable nutrients to the soil. As mulch decomposes, it provides a slow release of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.\n\n5. Protect plant roots: Mulch can help to protect the roots of young plants from extreme temperatures, helping them to establish themselves in the soil. It can also help to reduce competition for nutrients and water, as it prevents weed growth.\n\n6. Improve appearance: Mulch can help to improve the appearance of a landscape by making it look more manicured and well-maintained. Mulch provides an attractive cover that can help to blend the landscape with the surrounding environment. Different colors of mulch can also be used to create a visual effect or highlight specific plants in the landscape.\n\n7. Increase soil aeration: As mulch decomposes, it creates air pockets in the soil that can improve root development, water retention, and nutrient availability. This in turn helps to promote healthy plant growth.\n\nMulch should be used when establishing a new landscape or transplanting a lawn, as it can help to reduce the need for irrigation and prevent weed growth. Additionally, mulch should be used to help maintain existing landscapes, especially during drought conditions when water conservation is essential. Mulching also reduces the labor involved in frequent maintenance like weeding, as the mulch itself provides a natural landscape cover that suppresses weed growth for multiple seasons. In conclusion, the benefits of using mulch in the landscape include improved plant health and appearance, water conservation, and a reduced need for maintenance efforts. The mulch should ideally be applied in the late spring or early fall, to allow enough time for it to thoroughly cover the soil prior to the onset of the growing season. Mulch should be applied at a thick enough layer to cover the soil and yet still allow for light to pass through for proper plant growth. Generally, between 2-4 inches of mulch will generally be considered the ideal thickness. Proper maintenance of the landscape, including watering and fertilizing, will also be necessary for the healthy growth of plants. Mulch should not be used excessively, as excess levels can prevent light from reaching the soil and lead to reduced plant growth. Additionally, mulching should not be done near trees with shallow roots, as it can cause them to become waterlogged and diseased. Overall, the use of mulch in landscapes has many proven benefits and should be considered an integral part of a healthy and beautiful maintenance routine.", "shortest_response": "Mulch should be applied to your landscape to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, suppress weed growth, and improve soil quality as it breaks down. The best time to apply mulch varies depending on your specific climate, the type of plants you're mulching, and the season. Generally, it is best applied during the spring or summer when plants are not actively growing. During these times, applying a thin layer of mulch is typically best so as not to smother the plants. Fall is another good time for mulching, as the layer protects the plants over winter and helps retain the soil moisture to survive the cold, dry months. Always check the specific needs of the plants in your landscape and apply mulch accordingly, and never put it directly against tree trunks or plant bases, as this can cause damage.", "input_size": 11, "output_sizes": [434, 446, 285, 162, 463, 377, 439, 634, 506, 476], "output_mean": 422.2, "output_std": 120.83, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 391.25, "p50": 442.5, "p75": 472.75, "p99": 622.48}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 12.83854}, {"sample_id": "6a64a97a0e8f4673", "prompt_id": "41072015965af7f5", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Why do some scholars think that campaigns do not matter much for presidential election outcomes? Why do other scholars and practitioners think that campaigns do matter?", "longest_response": "The debate over the importance of campaigns in presidential elections is a highly nuanced and complex discussion among scholars and practitioners. The differing views stem from various perspectives on political processes, voter behavior, media influence, and historical data.\n\n### Arguments that Campaigns do Matter\n\n1. **Mobilization and Awareness**:\n   - **Key Issues and Voter Turnout**: Scholars and practitioners argue that campaigns are crucial for mobilizing the electorate, raising awareness about key issues, and motivating voters. Campaign activities, such as rallies, debates, and advertisements, often highlight important policy differences and candidates' stances, encouraging voters to participate in the electoral process.\n   - **Issue Ownership and Framing**: Campaigns have the strategic power to frame narratives around issues, setting the terms of the public debate and shaping voter perceptions of each candidate.\n\n2. **Voter Engagement and Persuasion**:\n   - **Direct Interaction**: Campaigns provide opportunities for direct interaction between candidates and voters through town halls, debates, and visits to diverse communities. This engagement can build personal connections and influence voter preferences.\n   - **Message Consistency and Reinforcement**: Effective campaigns craft and disseminate clear, consistent messages that can persuade undecided voters and solidify the support of party loyalists.\n\n3. **Media Influence**:\n   - **Media Attention and Coverage**: Campaigns dominate the news cycle, ensuring that candidates and their platforms receive significant media attention. This coverage can sway public opinion and keep candidates in the forefront of voters' minds.\n   - **Campaign Ads and Advertising**: Strategic use of television, radio, print, and digital advertising can reach a wide audience, creating impactful impressions and often swaying voters' perceptions and decisions.\n\n4. **Historical Precedents**:\n   - **Previous Elections**: Historical examples, such as the Nixon\u2013Kennedy debates in 1960 or Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign, show that a compelling campaign can significantly influence election outcomes. These cases demonstrate that effective campaigning can sometimes overcome other disadvantages.\n\n### Arguments that Campaigns do not Matter Much\n\n1. **Economic Conditions and Personal Issues**:\n   - **Voter Priorities**: In times of economic prosperity, the issues highlighted by campaigns may be less critical to voters compared to personal economic conditions, political stability, or social factors. Economic conditions and personal concerns often weigh more heavily on voters' minds than campaign messaging.\n   - **Local Issues and Personal Connections**: Voters may prioritize local issues or personal connections and affiliations over national campaign strategies, leading to a diminished impact of broad campaign efforts.\n\n2. **Strong Partisanship**:\n   - **Party Loyalty**: Voters who are strongly partisan are less likely to change their minds based on campaigns, as their voting behavior is rooted in party loyalty and ideology.\n   - **Entrenchment and Rigid Views**: Even in competitive races, the loyalty of partisans can remain entrenched, making them resistant to persuasive campaign efforts.\n\n3. **Negative Campaigning and Voter Disenfranchisement**:\n   - **Desensitization**: Constant exposure to negative campaigning can lead to voter fatigue, desensitizing the electorate to message repetition and reducing the effectiveness of campaigns.\n   - **Disengagement**: Particularly in older voter demographics, the constant barrage of campaign advertisements could lead to disengagement and a sense of fatalism regarding the election process.\n\n4. **Institutional and Structural Factors**:\n   - **Electoral College Dynamics**: The winner-takes-all nature of the Electoral College can reduce the direct effect of campaign efforts as focus shifts to swing states and specific key demographics within those states.\n   - **Political Machines and Grassroots Movements**: Local and grassroots political movements, independent of national campaign efforts, can have a substantial impact on voter mobilization and turnout.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe debate about the significance of presidential campaigns ultimately depends on the specific context of each election and various other factors. Scholars and practitioners alike contribute to this discourse by examining historical data, analyzing voter behavior, and considering media dynamics, economic conditions, and political culture. Both perspectives highlight the multifaceted nature of electoral politics and the ongoing evolution of campaigns in shaping presidential outcomes.", "shortest_response": "Some scholars argue that campaigns do not matter much for presidential election outcomes because they believe other factors have a more significant impact. They may cite reasons such as:\n\n1. **Incumbency Advantage**: Incumbents generally have the benefits of office, including name recognition, access to government funding, and better access to media, which can overshadow campaign efforts.\n\n2. **Media Saturation**: In an information-saturated age, scholars argue that the impact of campaigns is diluted by the sheer volume of information and attention across many issues that voters encounter through diverse sources like social media and news outlets.\n\n3. **Voter Decision-Making**: They may argue that voters often make decisions based on pre-existing beliefs and values, and that campaign events and advertisements have limited effect on swaying these established preferences.\n\n4. **Post-Election Behaviors**: Some scholars focus on what happens after the election. They may argue that factors like policy implementation and presidential performance play a bigger role in influencing public perception and future election outcomes than the campaign itself.\n\nOn the other hand, other scholars and practitioners believe that campaigns do matter and have a crucial impact on presidential elections for several reasons:\n\n1. **Visibility and Communication**: Campaigns serve to communicate the candidates' messages to a wide audience. The effectiveness of a campaign can significantly influence a voter\u2019s perception and understanding of each candidate\u2019s positions and personality.\n\n2. **Mobilization and Voter Turnout**: Effective campaigns can mobilize voters and increase voter turnout. Grassroots efforts and voter outreach strategies can make a substantial difference in who casts their vote.\n\n3. **Fundraising and Resources**: Campaigns often provide the means for candidates to acquire necessary resources, including funding for advertisements, staff, and events. A well-funded campaign can gain an advantage over an underfunded one.\n\n4. **Policy Emphasis and Issue Framing**: Campaigns can highlight key issues, frame debates, and shape the narrative around the election, influencing how voters prioritize issues and candidates.\n\n5. **Media Coverage**: Campaigns often lead to extensive media coverage, which can keep candidates in the public eye and shape voter perceptions.\n\n6. **Ground Game**: Effective ground operations, including door-to-door canvassing, phone banking, and local organizing, can significantly impact election outcomes, especially close to voting day.\n\nBoth perspectives can be seen as complementary rather than entirely opposing, as campaigns can create an initial engagement with voters, but the effectiveness of that engagement\u2014whether it results in election victory\u2014may depend on various factors such as the strength of incumbency, voter sentiments, and post-election performance.", "input_size": 31, "output_sizes": [601, 642, 670, 664, 599, 614, 853, 730, 652, 530], "output_mean": 655.5, "output_std": 82.87, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 604.25, "p50": 647.0, "p75": 668.5, "p99": 841.93}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 17.65387}, {"sample_id": "9a1500524686bdca", "prompt_id": "22658d0500af38e9", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "From the given text, Provide some info regarding consistory\nContext: In the Roman Catholic Church a consistory is a formal meeting of the College of Cardinals called by the pope.

The primary agents in this process are yeast or other leavening agents, like baking soda or baking powder. \n\n1. **Yeast Fermentation:** Yeast, a single-celled microorganism present in the active dry yeast or sourdough, consumes the sugars present in the flour, either maltose or glucose. As the yeast ferments the sugar, it produces carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) and ethanol (alcohol). The CO\u2082 gas gets trapped in the dough\u2019s gluten network, causing the bread to rise.\n\n2. **Molecular Gases:** The trapped carbon dioxide gas forms bubbles in the dough, which expand as the dough continues to rise. This expansion occurs while baking, leading to the light and airy structure of the bread.\n\n3. **Chemical Leaveners:** Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and baking powder (a combination of an acid and a base, usually baking soda and cream of tartar) also function as leavening agents. When mixed with water and activated by heat (or acid), they release carbon dioxide gas, which helps the bread rise similarly.\n\nThe combination of these gases and the proper kneading of the dough to develop gluten is what contributes to the overall rise and texture of the bread. The process can be broken down into the following stages:\n\n- **Mixing and kneading:** Combining the flour, water, yeast, and any other ingredients, which helps to develop the gluten.\n- **Fermentation:** Allowing the dough to rest (proof) and let the yeast ferment the sugars, producing gas.\n- **Rising and shaping:** The dough is allowed to rise further, incorporating more air.\n- **Baking:** Heating ensures the yeast has stopped reproducing and cooks out the residual flavors and kills any harmful microorganisms.

The battle lasted for five weeks from 16 December 1944 to 28 January 1945, towards the end of the war in Europe. It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region between Belgium and Luxembourg. It overlapped with the Alsace Offensive, subsequently the Colmar Pocket, another series of battles launched by the Germans in support of the Ardennes thrust.\n\nThe primary military objectives were to deny further use of the Belgian Port of Antwerp to the Allies and to split the Allied lines, which potentially could have allowed the Germans to encircle and destroy the four Allied forces. The Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, who since December 1941 had assumed direct command of the German army, believed that achieving these objectives would compel the Western Allies to accept a peace treaty in the Axis powers' favor. By this time, it was palpable to virtually the entire German leadership including Hitler himself that they had no realistic hope of repelling the imminent Soviet invasion of Germany unless the Wehrmacht was able to concentrate the entirety of its remaining forces on the Eastern Front, which in turn obviously required that hostilities on the Western and Italian Fronts be terminated. The Battle of the Bulge remains among the most important battles of the war, as it marked the last major offensive attempted by the Axis Powers on the Western front. After their defeat, Germany would retreat for the remainder of the war.\n\nThe Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December 1944, due to a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather. American forces bore the brunt of the attack. The Germans attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line, taking advantage of heavily overcast weather conditions that grounded the Allies' superior air forces. Fierce American resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive, around Elsenborn Ridge, and in the south, around Bastogne, blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success. Columns of armor and infantry that were supposed to advance along parallel routes found themselves on the same roads. This congestion, and terrain that favored the defenders, threw the German advance behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops.\n\nThe farthest west the offensive reached was the village of Foy-N\u00f4tre-Dame, south east of Dinant, being stopped by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division on 24 December 1944. Improved weather conditions from around 24 December permitted air attacks on German forces and supply lines, which sealed the failure of the offensive. On 26 December the lead element of Patton's U.S. Third Army reached Bastogne from the south, ending the siege. Although the offensive was effectively broken by 27 December, when the trapped units of 2nd Panzer Division made two break-out attempts with only partial success, the battle continued for another month before the front line was effectively restored to its position prior to the attack. In the wake of the defeat, many experienced German units were out of men and equipment, and the survivors retreated to the Siegfried Line.\n\nThe Germans' initial attack involved around 410,000 men; just over 1,400 tanks, tank destroyers, and assault guns; 2,600 artillery pieces; and over 1,000 combat aircraft, as well as large numbers of other armored fighting vehicles (AFVs). These were reinforced a couple of weeks later, bringing the offensive's total strength to around 450,000 troops, and 1,500 tanks and assault guns. Between 63,222 and 103,900 of these men were killed, missing, wounded in action, or captured. The battle severely depleted Germany's armored forces, which remained largely unreplaced throughout the remainder of the war. German Luftwaffe personnel, and later also Luftwaffe aircraft (in the concluding stages of the engagement) also sustained heavy losses.\n\nFrom among the Americans' peak strength of 610,000 troops there were 75,500 battle casualties, including about 8,400 killed. The \"Bulge\" was the largest and bloodiest single battle fought by the United States in World War II and the third-deadliest campaign in American history.", "longest_response": "Here are some important points about the Battle of the Bulge:\n\n1. Timeline and Location: The Battle of the Bulge (also known as the Ardennes Offensive) lasted from 16 December 1944 to 28 January 1945. It took place in the Ardennes region between Belgium and Luxembourg, an area heavily forested and known for its challenging terrain.\n\n2. Surprise Attack: The German offensive was launched through the Ardennes region, taking the Allies by surprise due to their overconfidence, preoccupation with other battles, and poor aerial reconnaissance. Bad weather on the morning of 16 December 1944 grounded Allied air forces and facilitated the German surprise attack.\n\n3. American Resistance: Fierce American resistance at key positions such as Elsenborn Ridge and Bastogne played a crucial role in delaying the German advance. Bastogne, in particular, was a critical stronghold and its defense delayed the German forces significantly.\n\n4. Patton's Arrival: The arrival of General Patton's U.S. Third Army at Bastogne on 26 December 1944 helped to relieve the surrounded town and ended the siege.\n\n5. Allied Reinforcements: Improved weather conditions around 24 December allowed for effective Allied air attacks on German forces and supply lines, crippling the offensive. The Allied forces also managed to reinforce and hold critical positions during the battle.\n\n6. German Strength and Resources: The German forces launched the offensive with around 410,000 troops, 1,400 tanks, and significant numbers of artillery and aircraft. However, they suffered substantial casualties, from which they were never fully restored during the remainder of the war.\n\n7. Impact on German Forces: The Battle of the Bulge severely depleted German armored forces, which were largely unreplaced throughout the war. The heavy losses in manpower, equipment, and resources contributed to Germany's inability to continue significant offensive operations.\n\n8. American Casualties: The battle had a significant impact on the American forces, with 75,500 casualties including approximately 8,400 killed. It was the largest and bloodiest single battle fought by the United States in World War II.\n\n9. Strategic Outcome: The failure of the Battle of the Bulge marked the last major offensive campaign by the Axis powers on the Western Front. Following this defeat, Germany's capability to advance significantly further diminished, leading to their eventual retreat and the Allies' subsequent victory.\n\n10. Historical Significance: The Battle of the Bulge remains one of the most important and pivotal battles of World War II, showcasing the strategic importance of the Ardennes region and highlighting the significant losses experienced by both the Allied and Axis forces during the conflict. It was a turning point that contributed to the Axis powers' ultimate defeat.", "shortest_response": "The Battle of the Bulge, also known as the Ardennes Offensive, was the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during World War II. It took place from December 16, 1944, to January 28, 1945, and aimed to disrupt the Allied advance towards Germany. The Germans successfully surprised the Allies due to Allied overconfidence, preoccupation, and poor aerial reconnaissance caused by bad weather. However, fierce resistance, combined with improved weather conditions that allowed Allied air attacks, ultimately thwarted the German advance. The battle resulted in heavy casualties on both sides and left Germany severely depleted, marking the end of significant German military offensives on the Western Front.", "input_size": 911, "output_sizes": [513, 420, 457, 395, 331, 351, 140, 552, 409, 494], "output_mean": 406.2, "output_std": 110.83, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 362.0, "p50": 414.5, "p75": 484.75, "p99": 548.49}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "summarization", "gen_time": 14.59112}, {"sample_id": "f4455c5514c14e44", "prompt_id": "04ff0a960e1e05b9", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Why age 27 is given so much importance specially in Music industry?", "longest_response": "The age of 27 holds a special significance in the music industry for a variety of reasons, encompassing a mix of psychological, social, and career development factors. While it can vary somewhat depending on individual circumstances and cultural contexts, here are some key reasons why this age is often highlighted:\n\n1. **Psychological Maturity**: By the age of 27, many individuals reach a level of psychological maturity that enables them to make more deliberate and thoughtful career decisions. The accumulation of life experiences, self-awareness, and emotional stability often provides the groundwork for taking on greater risks and responsibilities.\n\n2. **Career Maturation**: Early 27 is a critical period in a musician's career where many artists have progressed from their early careers or early twenties. By this age, artists may have had enough exposure to different types of music, developed a unique sound, gained a modest amount of success, and possibly accumulated enough savings or investment to focus on their craft without immediate financial pressures.\n\n3. **Industry Networking and Influence**: By 27, many musicians have had enough time to network with industry professionals, attend influential music events, collaborate with other artists, and gain enough public attention to stand out in the competitive world of music. Building a social and professional network is crucial for opportunities in the music industry.\n\n4. **Cultural and Industry Milestones**: Historically, people in their early 30s have often been seen as mature enough to succeed in various fields due to the combination of youth's adaptability and midlife life experiences. The music industry, in particular, values those who have spent enough time honing their craft, adapting to industry challenges, and showing resilience.\n\n5. **Timing of Major Life Events**: Around this age, many musicians also experience significant life events that can influence their careers, such as setting up family life, furthering education, or making strategic decisions about career direction. These events can provide a clearer perspective on their goals and ambitions in the music industry.\n\n6. **Historical Examples**: There are many notable artists who have achieved significant success or made major career milestones in their early 30s, creating a cultural benchmark. Examples include artists like Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift, and Pharrell Williams, who have made substantial impacts on the music industry by this age.\n\nIt's important to note that while 27 is often emphasized, success and maturity can occur at different ages for different people, and advancements in the music industry continue to be influenced by artists who break traditional age norms. However, the convergence of various factors at this age often results in it being associated with a notable period of potential in a musician's career journey.", "shortest_response": "The importance of turning 27 in the music industry, particularly for British musicians Bill Kaine, George Michael, Adam Ant, and Boy George as well as American musicians like Joss Stone and Pharrell Williams, stems from the tradition of referring to this milestone as \"Alexander Graham Bell Day,\" named after the inventor. In 1997, the United Kingdom released a commemorative coin to celebrate this event, and it eventually turned into a cultural icon symbolizing the transformative period of 27. The exact origin and significance of the number 27 within the UK music industry are not entirely clear and some speculate it emerged coincidentally, linked to the release of the coin that year.\n\nSome theories suggest there may be symbolic or numerological reasons behind its mystique. For instance, the number 27 in various cultural mythologies often carries connotations of change, growth, and maturity, all of which could be seen as appealing qualities for musicians as they reach a new phase in their careers.\n\nThe phenomenon has contributed to a heightened interest in birthdays on the 27th, with musicians and their fans often noting this date and perhaps seeing it as a turning point. While the specific origin of the number 27's celebrated status in the music industry is a bit obscure, it undeniably holds a special place in the cultural narrative of the music world.", "input_size": 17, "output_sizes": [454, 531, 390, 397, 502, 269, 312, 502, 455, 450], "output_mean": 426.2, "output_std": 80.35, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 391.75, "p50": 452.0, "p75": 490.25, "p99": 528.39}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "brainstorming", "gen_time": 10.71048}, {"sample_id": "0be4042ba6f65637", "prompt_id": "c2824e4e69d3c9e8", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Write a monologue describing a young woman\u2019s journey to self-actualization in America.", "longest_response": "(Standing center stage, the young woman, Maya, paces slightly, her eyes reflecting a well of emotions.

I knew that this journey would come with its fair share of trials, its trials mirroring the tumultuous seas I had sailed to leave home. Yet, from my initial days of cultural shock and self-doubt, I quickly discerned a pattern, a rhythm that guided me forward: embrace the unknown, remain steadfast in spirit, and let resilience be your compass.\n\nEvery city I've explored echoed the promise of new beginnings. On the bustling streets of New York, I found solace in the anonymity, where I could shed the cocoon of my previous life and emerge as a fresh butterfly.

Some races also post transition times separately.\n\nOther rules of triathlon vary from race to race and generally involve descriptions of allowable equipment (for example, wetsuits are allowed in USAT events in the swimming stage of some races when the water temperature is below 25.6 \u00b0C (78.1 \u00b0F)), and prohibitions against interference between athletes. Additionally, the use of flippers or other swim propulsion and flotation aids are illegal in triathlon and can result in disqualification.\n\nOne rule involving the cycle leg is that the competitor's helmet must be donned before the competitor mounts (or even takes possession of, in certain jurisdictions) the bike, and it must remain on until the competitor has dismounted; the competitor may not be required to wear the helmet when not on the bicycle (e.g. while repairing a mechanical problem). Failure to comply with this rule will result in disqualification. Additionally, while on the bike course, all bicycles shall be propelled only by human force and human power. Other than pushing a bicycle, any propulsive action brought on by use of the hands is prohibited. Should a competitor's bike malfunction they can proceed with the race as long as they are doing so with their bicycle in tow. There are also strict rules regarding the 'bike mount' line. Competitors may not begin riding their bicycle out of transition until they are over a clearly marked line. Mounting the bike prior to this may incur a penalty (example: a 15-second time penalty at the London 2012 Olympics was imposed on Jonathan Brownlee, a competitor from Great Britain, for mounting his bike too early.)\n\nOther time penalties can be incurred during the race for, among other things, drafting on the bike in a non-drafting race, improper passing, littering on course, and unsportsmanlike conduct.", "longest_response": "A triathlon consists of three main competition sections: swimming, cycling, and running. As a universal competition format, these five sections can be broken down to help us understand the progression of the triathlon:\n\n1. Swim time (from the start of the swim to the beginning of the first transition): In this section, racers swim from a starting pool to a transition area where they switch to their bicycles. At this point, their swimming time has been recorded and marks the beginning of the swimming portion of the triathlon.\n\n2. Transition 1 time (from the beginning of the first transition to the end of the first transition): Athletes move through a series of transitions, or \"transitions,\" between the three individual parts of the triathlon. At the first transition, swimmers hand off their goggles and receive their wetsuit and helmet, if needed, and put on their cycling shorts and shoes. Cyclists dismount their bicycles, put their helmets back on, if needed, and get on their road clothes and shoes. The first transition area is where both these activities take place\u2014and where racing officially begins.\n\n3. Cycling time (from the start of the cycling to the end of the cycling leg): In the cycling portion of the triathlon, competitors traverse predetermined road course segments on their bicycles. At the end of the course, all cyclists dismount, pass their bikes to the volunteers who transport them to the transition area, hand off their gloves and helmets, and put on their running clothes and shoes for the final leg of their triathlon.\n\n4. Transition 2 time (from the beginning of the 2nd transition to the end of the 2nd transition): After a short resting time, the athletes are back up and running. The second transition period is the time during which athletes switch clothing for the running segment of the race and are prepared to leave for the final leg of the competition. In this stage, they must hand off their bicycles to the volunteers and receive their T-shirt and headbands (as well as any necessary running accessories, such as a watch). The second transitions takes place in the designated running transition area.\n\n5. Run time (from the start of the run to the end of the run): Once in a fresh outfit and ready to go, the triathletes race off and towards the finish line. This is the final leg of the competition and marks the end of the entire race. Athletes cross the finish line, passing a finish tent, and immediately start their medal ceremony. The run time marks one of the most rewarding parts of a triathlon, as competitors race against one another to reach the finish line and their hopes of winning the gold, silver, or bronze medal.\n\nIn summary, a triathlon consists of a swim, bike, and run, with transitions in between the three stages. Transition areas are typically the sites where athletes swap out their gear as they move from one part of the competition to the next. The start of a race usually begins with the swim, then transitions, followed by cycling, then another transition, and finally the run. The course is typically divided into equal parts, with no one section having a special status or being more important than the others, making the triathlon an individual effort against one's physical and mental capacity to complete the whole thing.", "shortest_response": "The basic universal competition sections of the triathlon, in order, are as follows:\n\n1. Swim Time: This section measures the time it takes for a competitor to complete the swimming portion of the triathlon. It starts from the beginning of the swimming leg and ends when the swimmer reaches the first transition area. This section tests the competitor's swimming speed, technique, and endurance.\n\n2. Transition Time 1 (T1): This section measures the time it takes for a competitor to switch from the swimming to the cycling leg. It starts when the swimmer reaches the transition area and ends when the competitor mounts their bicycle. This section evaluates the competitor's speed and efficiency in transitioning between different transportation modes.\n\n3. Cycling Time: This section encompasses both the cycling Leg and the second Transition Time (T2) period. It starts from the beginning of the cycling and ends when the competitor completes the second transition and is ready to start running. It measures the competitor's cycling speed, efficiency in transitions, and overall time. A penalty for mounting the bicycle too early or drafting (riding closely behind another competitor to reduce wind resistance and fatigue) can be imposed in some cases.\n\n4. Run Time: This section is the final leg of the triathlon, measuring the time it takes a competitor to complete the running portion. It starts from the transition area and ends when the competitor crosses the finish line. This part tests the competitor's running speed, stamina, and ability to sustain a strong pace over distance.\n\nThe competitor's total triathlon time is the sum of the four sections: swim time, first transition time (T1), cycling time, and run time. The winner is the competitor with the shortest total time.

It began in Tunisia in response to corruption and economic stagnation. From Tunisia, the protests then spread to five other countries: Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Bahrain. Rulers were deposed (Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Muammar Gaddafi, Hosni Mubarak, Ali Abdullah Saleh) or major uprisings and social violence occurred including riots, civil wars, or insurgencies.

Rivers: Flowing bodies of water that usually contain freshwater, are fed by groundwater, streams, springs and/or melting snow and/or ice. Some rivers, known as perennial rivers, flow year-round with some constant flow, while others flow seasonally and are called seasonal rivers (or ephemeral rivers).\n\n2. Lakes: Large bodies of freshwater that are formed by rivers, streams, melting ice, or groundwater discharge, or have formed due to tectonic activity. Lakes can vary greatly in size and depth, from small, shallow ponds to large, deep waters.\n\n3. Ponds: Smaller bodies of freshwater than lakes, ponds typically contain less depth, volume and flow. They are often shallow and surrounded by a perimeter of embankment or shoreline. Ponds provide habitats for a variety of wildlife, including fish, amphibians, and various insects.\n\n4. Wetlands: A diverse group of habitats (marshes, swamps, marshes, bogs, and fens) where soil is saturated with water often leading to the presence of water-loving plants. Wetlands are important ecosystems that provide vital habitats for a diverse range of wildlife, as well as acting as natural water filtration systems. Wetlands also help to reduce erosion and offer flood protection benefits that can help protect against severe weather events such as heavy rain and high tides, or droughts. Wetlands also serve as critical habitats for numerous fish and amphibian species as well as a multitude of bird species. Wetlands provide an excellent example of natural water filtration, with their ability to trap sediment, nutrients, and other pollutants and helping to filter and clean the water that flows through them. This helps to provide clean, fresh water for plants, animals, and people to drink. Wetlands are also very important for providing vital habitats for a diverse range of wildlife, including fish, amphibians, bird species, and other creatures. These ecosystems are found throughout the world, including in wetlands in the UK, North America, Europe and parts of Central and South America. Wetlands also play a crucial role in combating climate change by providing a natural way of storing and recycling carbon. They also protect coastal areas from storm surges and erosion, all while providing a place for recreation and tourism. So, there are four specific types of freshwater waterways: rivers, lakes, ponds, and wetlands. These are all important for supporting a diverse array of wildlife, filtering and cleaning waste, reducing erosion, and providing places for recreation and tourism.

However, they differ in several ways related to their mechanics, the muscles involved, the energy expenditure, the impact on the body, and their use in daily life and exercise programs. Here are some key differences:\n\n**1. Mechanical differences:**\n\n- **Movement pattern:** Walking follows a heel-to-toe progression, while running involves a brief suspension phase when both feet are off the ground (known as the flight phase), followed by a period of one foot being in contact with the ground (the stance phase) while the other foot is in the air.\n\n- **Footstrike:** Walking typically has a flat-footed or slightly heel-strike approach, whereas running often starts with a forefoot strike and can transition to heel-strike during landing to absorb impact.\n\n- **Gait:** Walking has a slower, more rhythmic motion, while running is faster and more dynamic.\n\n**2. Muscular engagement and demand:**\n\n- **Muscle groups:** Both activities engage a similar range of muscles in the legs. However, running places a greater emphasis on the calf muscles, quadriceps, and hip flexors due to the propulsive force needed when the foot leaves the ground. Walking engages these muscles less intensely.\n\n- **Energy production:** Running generally requires more energy per unit distance because of the faster pace and additional force generated, whereas walking has a lower energy expenditure and can be a more efficient way to cover distance on flat ground.\n\n- **Lateral motion:** Running also involves greater lateral (side-to-side) motion, which can be less stable and puts additional strain on the ankles and joints.\n\n**3. Impact on the body:**\n\n- **Ground reaction force:** Running generates greater forces on the feet and joints due to the higher impact of body weight being transferred forward and upwards when pushing off the ground. As a result, running can lead to a higher risk of impact injuries if not performed correctly or with proper footwear and training.\n\n- **Injury risk:** The impact of running increases the potential for stress-related injuries like shin splints, IT band syndrome, and stress fractures. Walking is generally considered to have a lower risk of impact injuries, but it is not entirely free from such risks, especially on uneven surfaces or when the walk is rushed.\n\n- **Posture:** In walking, the head, neck, and upper body tend to have a more stable and upright posture compared to running, where there may be greater forward lean for propulsion.\n\n**4. Use in daily life and exercise:**\n\n- **Training goals:** Walking can serve as an active recovery option, a form of exercise for cardiovascular health, or a way to cover distances without the high impact associated with running. Running often includes more vigorous interval training but also comes with a higher risk of injury.\n\n- **Accessibility:** Walking is typically less demanding in terms of physical ability and can be done virtually anywhere. Running may require more specialized shoes and more space, as it can be harder for individuals with balance or mobility issues.\n\n- **Endurance:** Over time, running can contribute more significantly to building endurance and cardiovascular fitness than walking due to the higher amount of energy expended at a faster pace. Walking, including jogging or power-walking, can still effectively build endurance, especially at a brisk pace.\n\n- **Weight loss and exercise variety:** Both walking and running can aid in weight loss and overall fitness. Walking can be a lower-impact way to manage weight or exercise routine for a broader range of individuals, while running can provide a more challenging workout that can help burn more calories and increase metabolic rate.\n\nIn practice, many people incorporate both walking and running into their exercise routines for various reasons, such as to minimize impact while still getting the benefits associated with both activities. Choosing between walking and running often depends on individual goals, preferences, fitness levels, available time, and health considerations.", "shortest_response": "Walking and running are both forms of physical activity, but they differ in several key ways:\n\n1. Movement: In walking, your feet pass each other as you push off with one foot and land on the opposite foot. In running, your foot falls in front of your body, and it's slightly higher and quicker.\n\n2. Gait: Walking has a two-step gait, while running has a shorter, smoother stride.\n\n3. Speed: Running allows you to travel faster than walking since your feet cover more ground with each stride and your heart rate increases significantly.\n\n4. Energy expenditure: Because running burns more calories per minute than walking, it can be considered more efficient in terms of cardiovascular benefits.\n\n5. Impact: Walking and running can both cause impacts on your body, but the degree of impact is higher in running due to the faster, more forceful footfalls.\n\nIn summary, walking and running are similar forms of physical activity, but they differ in terms of movement, gait, speed, energy expenditure, and impact.", "input_size": 12, "output_sizes": [801, 524, 491, 607, 406, 523, 207, 473, 400, 276], "output_mean": 470.8, "output_std": 158.21, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 401.5, "p50": 482.0, "p75": 523.75, "p99": 783.54}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "open_qa", "gen_time": 16.22719}, {"sample_id": "6a1c09e80ca3f483", "prompt_id": "70668e606fe0a758", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What did Michael Faraday and Georg Ohm do?\nContext: Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\u200a\nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.", "longest_response": "Michael Faraday and Georg Ohm were pivotal figures in the field of electromagnetism and electricity.\n\n**Michael Faraday:**\nMichael Faraday (1791-1867) was an English scientist best known for his pioneering work in electromagnetism and electrochemistry. He invented the electric motor as well as electromagnetic (induction) fields. Faraday is also credited with discovering electrolysis and the concept of chemical bonding. He laid the foundations of what later became the field of electrical engineering. Some of Faraday's key contributions include:\n\n- The invention of the first electric motor in 1821.\n- His work on electromagnetic induction, where he discovered the principle in 1831, leading to the development of the first electric generator (or dynamo) in 1866.\n- Faraday's law of induction, which describes how the motion of a conductor through a magnetic field can induce an electric current.\n- Faraday's discovery in 1837 that electricity could be transformed into light using his Faraday disk, a simple form of a light bulb.\n\n**Georg Ohm:**\nGeorg Simon Ohm (1787-1854) was a German physicist and mathematician who made fundamental contributions to the study of electricity. His most significant work includes:\n\n- Ohm's law, which quantifies the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in electrical circuits. It states that V = IR, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.\n- Ohm conducted extensive research on the electrical properties of materials, laying the groundwork for the field of electrical engineering.\n- His work in this area earned him the distinction of publishing the fundamental principles of electric circuits, which became known as Ohm's law.\n- Ohm also made significant contributions to the understanding of the electrical conductivity of metals and other materials.\n\nTogether, the work of Faraday and Ohm enabled a deeper understanding of electricity and laid the groundwork for modern electrical and electronic technology.

The name white hydrogen distinguishes it from green hydrogen, which is produced from renewable energy sources, and from grey, brown or black hydrogen, which is obtained from fossil sources or from the electrolysis of water. Natural hydrogen may be renewable, non-polluting and allows for lower cost operation compared to industrial hydrogen. Natural hydrogen has been identified in many source rocks in areas beyond the sedimentary basins where oil companies typically operate.\n\nOrigin of natural hydrogen\nThere are several sources of natural hydrogen:\n\n- degassing of deep hydrogen from the Earth's crust and mantle;\n- reaction of water with ultrabasic rocks (serpentinisation);\n- contact of water with reducing agents in the Earth's mantle;\n- interaction of water with freshly exposed rock surfaces (weathering);\n- decomposition of hydroxyl ions in the structure of minerals;\n- Natural radiolysis of water;\n- decomposition of organic matter;\n- biological activity\n- Extraction\n- Natural hydrogen is extracted from wells, mixed with other gases such as nitrogen or helium.\n\nSeveral sources have been identified in France. Geologists Alain Prinzhofer and Eric Derville have demonstrated the existence of large reservoirs in a dozen countries, including Mali and the United States. However, their potential remains difficult to assess.\n\nNumerous emanations on the ocean floor have been identified but are difficult to exploit. The discovery of a significant emergence in Russia in 2008 suggests the possibility of extracting native hydrogen in geological environments.\n\nGeology\nNatural hydrogen is generated continuously from a variety of natural sources. There are many known hydrogen emergences on mid-ocean ridges. Another of the known reactions, serpentinisation, occurs under the sea floor (in the oceanic crust).\n\nDiagenetic origin (iron oxidation) in the sedimentary basins of cratons, notably in Russia. Other sources are being explored, such as mantle hydrogen, or hydrogen from radiolysis (natural electrolysis) or from bacterial activity. In France, the Alps and Pyrenees are suitable for exploitation. New Caledonia has hyperalkaline sources that show dihydrogen emissions. A large accumulation of natural hydrogen was discovered in Bourakebougou (Mali).\n\nCharacteristics\nDihydrogen is very soluble in fresh water, especially at depth (solubility increases with pressure).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_hydrogen", "longest_response": "Another name for natural hydrogen, distinguishing it from other forms of hydrogen, is \"white hydrogen.\" This name helps identify it specifically from \"green hydrogen\" (produced using renewable energy) and \"grey, brown or black hydrogen\" (obtained from fossil sources or produced via the electrolysis of water).

As previously mentioned, the German forces, particularly Army Group B, lost considerable numbers and military resources that could no longer be replaced promptly. This failure forced Nazi Germany to divert resources and manpower from the Western Front to the Eastern Front.\n\n2. **Boost in Soviet Morale and Strength**: The victory significantly boosted Soviet morale and demonstrated their ability to repel the German invasion. After this turning point, the Soviet Union escalated its offensive efforts, eventually pushing German forces out of the Soviet Union. The Red Army's successful counteroffensive movements laid the groundwork for future advances, especially leading up to the Battle of Berlin.\n\n3. **Military Resource Redistribution**: With the defeat in Stalingrad, Germany had to reallocate troops and significant resources from Western Europe (where they had previously achieved more success) to the Eastern Front. This reassignment weakened the German war effort in the West and gave the Allies, particularly the British and Americans, some breathing room to launch counteroffensives.\n\n4. **Zhukov's Iconic Leadership**: The Soviet General Vasily Chuikov, commanding the 62nd Army of the Soviet Southwestern Front, displayed remarkable strategic leadership and tenacity in defending Stalingrad. His ability to inspire and lead his troops in harsh urban combat conditions provided a psychological edge. Chuikov's defense strategies played a crucial role in the eventual Soviet victory.\n\n5. **Psychological Impact**: The defeat at Stalingrad shattered any lingering belief of a quick German victory. It sent shockwaves across Europe and beyond, demoralizing Axis powers and galvanizing Allied forces. The battle's scale and intensity left a lasting impression on the global perception of the war.\n\n6. **Human and Economic Cost**: The battle inflicted severe casualties and marked an immense loss of resources on both sides. For Germany, the strategic failure meant immense loss of life, equipment, and the effective dissolution of the 6th Army. For the Soviet Union, while the battle was costly, it secured a decisive victory that bolstered their resources and manpower for future engagements.\n\nIn summary, the Battle of Stalingrad was vital because it changed the momentum of World War II, leading to the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany. The strategic, psychological, and human costs forced Germany into a defensive stance, while bolstering Soviet control and setting the stage for further Soviet advances into Eastern Europe and the heart of Nazi Germany.", "shortest_response": "The Battle of Stalingrad was crucial for several reasons. \n\n1. **Strategic Turning Point**: It marked a significant turning point in the Eastern Front of World War II. The defeat of Nazi Germany's 6th Army and substantial portions of its 4th Panzer Army marked the beginning of a sustained and aggressive advance by the Soviet Union towards Eastern Europe.\n\n2. **Psychological Impact**: The victory boosted the morale and confidence of the Soviet forces and population, while severely undermining the morale of the German troops and the Axis powers.\n\n3. **Operational and Logistical Strain on Nazi Germany**: The battle drained significant resources from Germany's military machine. The Wehrmacht had to reallocate troops from other fronts, weakening their positions elsewhere in occupied Europe.\n\n4. **Soviet Morale and Military Momentum**: The victory at Stalingrad rejuvenated the Red Army, leading to a series of successful offensives driving deeper into occupied Soviet territories.\n\n5. **Symbolic Significance**: The city's name and the fighting that took place became symbols of Soviet resistance and tenacity. Stalingrad's fall was crucial in the eventual turning of the tide against Nazi Germany.\n\nThe Battle of Stalingrad thus had profound military, strategic, psychological, and symbolic consequences, shaping the course of the war towards a Soviet victory.", "input_size": 233, "output_sizes": [465, 484, 371, 546, 274, 479, 496, 513, 508, 426], "output_mean": 456.2, "output_std": 76.35, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 435.75, "p50": 481.5, "p75": 505.0, "p99": 543.03}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "summarization", "gen_time": 11.18307}, {"sample_id": "4531c09116e48052", "prompt_id": "d11327133719331f", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Why are people migrating in the US from the NE and Mid-West to the South and SE?", "longest_response": "Migration patterns within the United States are influenced by a range of factors, which can include economic, social, cultural, and environmental reasons. Here are some key factors driving the trend of people moving from the Northeast (NE) and Midwest (Midwest) to the Southern and Southeastern (SE) regions:\n\n1. **Economic Opportunities**: The Southeast and South often enjoy more robust job markets, particularly in low-cost living areas. States like Texas, Florida, and Arizona, for example, are considered favorable for job seekers because they have a high demand for labor, lower housing costs, and fewer taxes.\n\n2. **Cost of Living**: Housing, food, and other essential costs tend to be significantly lower in the Southeast and South than in the NE and Midwest. These lower costs can be particularly appealing to families and retirees who are seeking to stretch their income further.\n\n3. **Climate and Weather**: The appeal of warmer climates, milder winters, and longer growing seasons is a notable draw for those relocating from the colder, more severe climate zones of the north. Southern states typically have milder winters and enjoy substantial sunshine, which can influence lifestyle choices and quality of life perceptions.\n\n4. **Lifestyle Preferences**: People often move for lifestyle reasons \u2013 whether it's seeking a retirement haven, desiring a less busy pace of life, or wanting a community with different social or cultural practices. Relatively relaxed, slower-paced coastal towns and suburbs in the Southeast and South can be attractive alternatives.\n\n5. **Education and Health Resources**: Certain Southern and Southeastern regions offer highly rated schools and healthcare facilities. Regions with top-ranked educational institutions can draw families and individuals seeking excellent educational opportunities for their children.\n\n6. **Social and Cultural Factors**: People may be influenced by social networks, communities, and cultural attractions. For example, areas known for vibrant tourist activities, cultural landmarks, or specific community dynamics might be more attractive to newcomers.\n\n7. **Political Climate**: Some people are motivated to move due to their political beliefs or the political climate, seeking communities that align more closely with their views and lifestyles.\n\n8. **Natural Environment and Recreational Opportunities**: The natural beauty and recreational opportunities available\u2014such as beaches, parks, and outdoor activities\u2014can be significant pull factors.\n\n9. **Migration Trends and Networks**: Once a wave of migration occurs (particularly if many people are moving in the same way), it can create a self-sustaining migration trend as people follow the perceived \"correct path\" due to familiarity from social networks and word of mouth.\n\nWhile these factors contribute to the trend, it's essential to note that migration patterns are complex and can shift over time due to economic changes, policy shifts, and other global events.

As a local born in this lively, multicultural nation, I've had the privilege of enjoying diverse traditions, educational opportunities, and a highly developed infrastructure. Here\u2019s my take on life growing up in Singapore:\n\n### Education and Extracurricular Activities\n\nEducation has always been a top priority in Singapore, so from the moment I started school, I knew it was going to be rigorous and comprehensive. Singapore's education system is one of the best in the world, offering a wide range of subjects, from Mathematics and Science to the Arts. It\u2019s impressive how every school has well-equipped labs, libraries, and sports facilities.\n\nExtracurricular activities were also a big part of my life. I participated in Singapore Youth Council (SYC) during my secondary school years, which made me appreciate community service from a young age. There were cultural and national education activities as well, like celebrating Chinese New Year and Hari Raya, where I got a chance to learn and celebrate different cultures and traditions.\n\n### Public Playgrounds and Parks\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of growing up in Singapore was having access to well-maintained playgrounds and parks. Neighborhoods like Ang Mo Kio and Bedok had public playgrounds where I could spend afternoons playing, especially in the lush greenery that Singapore is known for. These spaces were important for fostering a sense of community and providing a safe environment for children to play and socialize.\n\n### Family Life\n\nFamily gatherings were another integral part of my life. Since the emphasis on celebrating multiple cultural festivals, I grew up with an appreciation for family unity and cultural diversity. For instance, during Chinese New Year, my family and neighbors would gather to exchange greetings, share mooncakes, and perform lion dances. Similarly, Hari Raya brought us together to relish traditional cuisine and share stories.\n\nDining with family, which traditionally included dishes from different ethnic backgrounds like Hainanese chicken rice, laksa, and roti prata, cultivated a balanced and inclusive diet. It fostered a sense of belonging and gratitude for my cultural heritage.\n\n### Community and National Pride\n\nSingapore\u2019s sense of community is strong, and there was always an emphasis on \u201cclean, safe, and green.\u201d Community centers and religious buildings were hubs where neighbors would come together for various activities. The sense of belonging was also amplified during national events. The vibrant parades, like those during Chinese New Year, and sports events, such as the Homecoming Cup, instilled a deep sense of national pride and unity among us.\n\nSports, as well, have always been integral to our lives. Schools had robust sports programs, and parents often organized friendly matches and sports camps to encourage physical fitness. As someone who enjoyed outdoor activities and team sports, I participated in football and basketball, which I found incredibly fun and rewarding.\n\n### Modern Amenities and Development\n\nLiving in Singapore has always come with its set of modern amenities. Advanced public transport, clean and well-planned residential areas, and various shopping complexes made daily life convenient. I especially loved the connectivity provided by our MRT system, which made commuting quick and reliable.\n\nThe constant development of technology and innovation has been fascinating. From having access to the latest gadgets and fast internet to attending tech schools like Nanyang Technological University, we've always been ahead of the curve.\n\n### Environment and Public Spaces\n\nSingapore\u2019s focus on maintaining a clean environment and preserving green spaces has always been admirable. The park connectors, such as the Tuas Nexus and North West Polyclinics, offered safe and pleasant walkways for people to enjoy nature alongside urban living. It\u2019s remarkable how green spaces are integrated into city planning, making the city as much a haven for nature lovers as it is for urban dwellers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGrowing up in Singapore has been nothing short of delightful. The blend of rich cultural heritage, strong community spirit, excellent education, and modern facilities has contributed to a wholesome and balanced upbringing. Each aspect, from my family gatherings to participating in community services, has instilled a deep sense of pride, belonging, and appreciation for the country I call home. Overall, it has been a privilege to grow up in such a vibrant and welcoming nation.", "shortest_response": "Growing up in Singapore as a local born after 1985, I've experienced a unique blend of modern living, rich traditions, and vibrant multiculturalism. Life in Singapore was never monotonous; it was always a colorful tapestry woven with the threads of our diverse cultures.\n\nOne great aspect of growing up here was the remarkable education system. We had access to some of the best schooling in the world, with English as the medium of instruction, which, while sometimes challenging, opened doors to global opportunities. I remember participating in various extracurricular activities, like school clubs or performing arts, which developed my skills and expanded my horizons.\n\nSingapore's emphasis on cleanliness, order, and community also stood out. We were encouraged to help keep our neighborhoods tidy with regular cleaning drives and were always mindful of maintaining harmony in our diverse communities. This helped foster a sense of pride and belonging from a young age.\n\nFood was another highlight of growing up in Singapore. We were constantly exposed to a variety of culinary delights, from hawker stalls serving mouthwatering curries and satays to Chinese, Malay, and Thai dishes. These meals provided not only sustenance but also an appreciation for the rich cultural tapestry that makes up our local palates.\n\nSingapore's public transportation system, or the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), was a significant part of daily life. Using the MRT was not just convenient but a unique experience. Navigating through the complex network of trains, buses, and monorails became second nature, making my journey to places both familiar and exciting.\n\nThe emphasis on outdoor activities also contributed to growing up here. We enjoyed exploring the lush green parks, walking along the beaches of the East and West Coasts (like our fond memories of Changi Beach), and participating in national sporting events or school sports practices. The blend of nature and modern urban life added a unique charm to our daily lives.\n\nSingapore's multicultural environment was a fantastic backdrop. We were accustomed to seeing a mix of Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Western cultures at every corner. This environment taught us to respect and celebrate our differences while appreciating our shared identity as Singaporeans.\n\nSingapore's vibrant entertainment scene, from bustling hawker centers to state-of-the-art malls, provided plenty of fun and excitement. I remember attending school fairs, movie screenings, and local festivals that celebrated our rich cultural heritage.\n\nIn summary, growing up in Singapore since after 1985 was a unique experience. From the education system to the multicultural environment, public transport, and our love for food, the city-state had a way of touching every aspect of life.

Some go further and suggest that Samhain may have been Christianized as All Hallow's Day, along with its eve, by the early Church. Other academics believe Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday, being the vigil of All Hallow's Day.

Additionally, Mexico is a member of several international organizations, including the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS).", "input_size": 7, "output_sizes": [332, 236, 356, 319, 198, 363, 269, 261, 412, 305], "output_mean": 305.1, "output_std": 61.47, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 263.0, "p50": 312.0, "p75": 350.0, "p99": 407.59}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "open_qa", "gen_time": 8.26388}, {"sample_id": "eafe532cfaf1c069", "prompt_id": "6fb6d1b2483bec60", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "How does a transistor amplify a signal?", "longest_response": "A transistor amplifies a signal by controlling the flow of electrical current through a semiconductor material via an input voltage. There are three types of bipolar junction transistors (bipolar junction transistors, BJTs): NPN, PNP, and PNP-NPN. These devices are commonly used for amplification purposes. The basic working principle of a transistor to amplify a signal can be outlined as follows:\n\n1. Connection: The three terminals of the transistor are called the emitter (E), base (B), and collector (C). The emitter terminal is typically heavily doped, and the collector and base terminals are moderately doped.\n\n2. Operation: The transistor operates in three regions: cutoff, active, and saturation.\n\n   a. Cutoff Region: In the cutoff region (no signal applied), the base-emitter junction is reverse biased, meaning the base-emitter junction voltage (V_BE) is negative, and the collector-base junction is also reverse biased. As a result, no current enters the collector, and the collector current (I_C) is negligible.\n\n   b. Active Region: In the active region (normal operation mode), a small base-emitter voltage (V_BE) is applied so that the base-emitter junction is forward biased. This allows a small base current (I_B) to flow, which controls a much larger collector current (I_C) through the emitter-base junction. The transistor amplifies signals by using this current control relationship. In the active region, the collector current is proportional to the base current, i.e., I_C \u221d I_B.\n\n   c. Saturation Region: In the saturation region, both junctions between the emitter-base and base-collector are forward biased. In this region, the transistor is fully on, and the collector-emitter voltage (V_CE) becomes zero. A large current flows between the collector and emitter, resulting in a saturated condition.\n\n3. Output Signal: When an input signal is applied at the base of the transistor, it modulates the base current (I_B). This modulation changes the collector current (I_C) flowing through the output circuit, thereby creating an amplified output signal. The output voltage amplitude is proportional to the amplified base current amplitude. The current gain (\u03b1) and voltage gain (A_V) are two important parameters in signal amplification.\n\nIn summary, a transistor amplifies a signal by controlling the electrical current using a small input voltage. The current gain (\u03b1) and voltage gain (A_V) indicate the level of amplification provided by the transistor. By manipulating the input signal at the base terminal, the transistor can amplify an electrical signal, producing a larger output signal in the collector-emitter circuit.", "shortest_response": "Certainly. A transistor can amplify a signal by using one of its three terminals: the base, collector, or emitter. The typical configuration for using a transistor for amplification is the common-emitter configuration.\n\n\nIn this setup, the base-emitter junction is forward biased while the collector-emitter junction is reverse biased. When a small alternating current (AC) signal is applied to the base of the transistor, it modulates the base-emitter junction current. Since a small base current can control a much larger collector current (assuming the transistor is well designed and operated within its limits), the amplification effect occurs.\n\n\nThe signal is amplified because the change in the small base current produces a proportionally larger change in the collector current which, through the load connected to the collector, results in a larger output signal. The signal's amplitude is essentially increased while the other characteristics, such as the frequency and phase, mainly remain the same. The actual amplification factor (or gain) is determined by the characteristics of the transistor, and the design of the circuit, including the values of resistors and the characteristics of the load.", "input_size": 11, "output_sizes": [331, 333, 548, 270, 361, 270, 383, 222, 365, 485], "output_mean": 356.8, "output_std": 93.93, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 285.25, "p50": 347.0, "p75": 378.5, "p99": 542.33}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 11.02462}, {"sample_id": "6f886f11645c1d71", "prompt_id": "b321d0f41ca3912f", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Extract the names of persons and countries in two different lists separated by commas: \"Sunday\u2019s blast has echoes of the car bombing that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of influential ultra-nationalist philosopher Alexander Dugan in August 2022.

They are named after distinctive stone tools found at Clovis, New Mexico. These people are often considered direct ancestors or closely related to early Native Americans.\n\n2. **Denisovans**: Genetic studies have revealed that modern Native Americans have inherited some DNA from an unknown species, formerly referred to as the \"Denisovans\" (from the Siberian site of Denisova Cave). They are thought to have migrated to the Americas independently and interbred with the ancestors of Native Americans between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago.\n\n3. **Initial Migrants**: The ancestors of Native Americans likely arrived via the Bering Land Bridge, sometimes referred to as \"Beringia,\" around 15,000 to 20,000 years ago. This migration occurred between 15,000\u201320,000 years ago, during the end of the last Ice Age.\n\nThese migratory waves blended with or replaced earlier groups that had lived in North and South America long before these migrations. The evidence suggests that the ancestors of Native Americans migrated from Siberia to North America via Beringia and then spread throughout the continent.\n\nOverall, the complex ancestry of Native Americans includes contributions from these migratory populations, among others. Each subsequent wave of migration contributed to the genetic and cultural diversity we see in Native American populations today.

Howling can help them stay in touch with pack members and may also serve as a way to express different emotions or situations.\n\n3. **Territorial Behavior**: When feeling threatened or facing a perceived intruder (such as other dogs, strangers, or even wildlife), huskies may howl as a defense mechanism. This helps them warn others and protect their territory.\n\n4. **Emotions and Interaction**: Huskies may also howl when they are very excited, frustrated, or playful. This behavior can be a way for them to bond with their human family, especially when they need reassurance or are feeling lonely.\n\n5. **Alerting and Warning**: Loud howling can serve as a warning to send an alert to distant family members or friends, or it can be a way to show that the husky is alert and aware of its surroundings.\n\n6. **Exercise and Release**: Huskies are an energetic breed that needs physical activity. Sometimes, howling during longer walks or when they are on a leash can be a way for them to release excess energy and relieve stress.\n\nIt's important to train huskies properly and provide them with enough mental and physical stimulation to help them express themselves in healthy and appropriate ways.

It requires you to maintain and manage the underlying infrastructure.\n   - **Gen 2 (Azure HDInsight Gen 2):** This is a fully cloud-based offering. Azure provides the infrastructure, so you don't have to worry about managing the hardware or infrastructure yourself.\n\n2. **Licensing Cost:**\n   - **Gen 1:** You need to purchase and maintain licenses for each of the services you use.\n   - **Gen 2:** You are charged based on the resources consumed in the cloud, similar to other Azure services.\n\n3. **Management and Maintenance:**\n   - **Gen 1:** You are responsible for managing and maintaining your own cluster, including updates, backups, and security patches.\n   - **Gen 2:** Azure takes care of the maintenance, updates, and scalability. The environment is managed entirely by Azure, so you only need to worry about your ETL processing code and data.\n\n4. **Scalability:**\n   - **Gen 1:** You need to manually manage the scaling of your clusters. You can either add more nodes or upgrade the cluster to a larger size, but this involves significant effort and might involve downtime.\n   - **Gen 2:** Scaling is as simple as increasing the number of virtual machine instances in your Azure HDInsight cluster. You can make adjustments as needed without the downtime associated with manual upgrades or downgrades.\n\n5. **Feature Set and Integration:**\n   - **Gen 1:** While HDInsight Gen1 supports popular big data tools like Hadoop, HDFS, Spark, Hive, and more, there are limited integrations with other Azure services compared to Gen 2.\n   - **Gen 2:** Azure HDInsight is fully integrated with the Azure ecosystem, providing better compatibility and a smoother experience when working with other Azure services such as Microsoft SQL, Power BI, and Azure Data Factory.\n\n6. **Pricing:**\n   - **Gen 1:** Pricing structures are based on the chosen hardware and licensing costs.\n   - **Gen 2:** Cost is based on the compute resources consumed and can be more predictable with flat-rate pricing or Pay-As-You-Go models.\n\nIn summary, ADLS Gen 1 was a traditional, on-premises data processing service with its own infrastructure and licensing costs, requiring significant management overhead.

Here are some of the key reasons:\n\n1. **Economic Stagnation and Inefficiency**: The Soviet centralized planned economy faced several long-standing issues, including stagnation, lack of innovation, and inefficiency. The inability of the system to sustain rapid technological advancement and produce the variety of goods demanded by consumers created widespread dissatisfaction.\n\n2. **Bureaucratic and Autocratic Governance**: For decades, the Soviet Union was ruled by a rigid, authoritarian regime under the Communist Party. This governance style stifled political freedom, discouraged constructive criticism, and led to widespread corruption and abuse of power by bureaucrats.\n\n3. **Nuclear Armament and Military Spending**: Although the Cold War provided a sense of purpose and unity through a common enemy (the West, particularly the USA), the enormous expenditure necessary to keep the Soviet military and its nuclear capabilities cutting-edge added immense strain to the Soviet economy.\n\n4. **Reform Efforts and Glasnost**: Mikhail Gorbachev came into power in 1985 and introduced policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) to revitalize the Soviet Union. However, these reforms were too little and too late. Glasnost opened the door to public criticism, leading to heightened awareness of the regime's failures, and perestroika led to economic disarray.\n\n5. **Nationalism and Independence Movements**: The Soviet Union comprised numerous ethnicities and nationalities, each with varying degrees of tolerance and desire for autonomy and independence. Gorbachev\u2019s reforms and the resultant glasnost triggered nationalist movements, particularly among the Baltic States, Ukraine, and Caucasus, culminating in declarations of independence.\n\n6. **Loss of Superpower Status**: By the late 1980s, the Soviet Union had already lost its superpower status and influence to the United States and its allies. The arms race, economic burden, and military engagements had diminished its stature and authority.\n\n7. **Economic Hardships**: The inefficiencies of the planned economy and Gorbachev's reforms led to deep economic troubles, including shortages of basic goods, inflation, and a growing black market. These economic problems eroded public confidence in the government.\n\n8. **Political Fragmentation and Coup Attempt**: Within the Communist Party and among the Soviet elite, there was significant division about the future direction of the country. This disunity contributed to the internal weakening of the government. In August 1991, a failed coup by hard-line communists against Gorbachev aimed to preserve the old Soviet structure, further destabilized the political situation.\n\n9. **International Pressures**: The shifting global political climate, marked by the end of the Cold War, provided the Soviet Union both with new diplomatic opportunities and additional pressures. Gorbachev\u2019s vision of a more cooperative international stance contrasted sharply with the traditional Soviet approach, and the USSR could not afford to maintain its rigid stance indefinitely.\n\nThe culmination of these factors led to a weakening of Soviet control, culminating in Gorbachev resigning his position as General Secretary in December 1991, followed by the dissolution of the Soviet Union two months later.\n\nIn summary, the collapse of the Soviet Union was a result of a combination of deep-seated economic problems, ineffective political systems, unsustainable spending, and the rise of nationalist movements within its constituent republics. The interplay of these factors created a perfect storm that ultimately resulted in the breakup of one of the 20th century's most powerful states.", "shortest_response": "The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 was due to a combination of factors, including:\n\n1. Economic Stagnation: The Soviet Union experienced years of economic stagnation due to inefficient central planning, reliance on heavy industry, and technological lag. This led to poor productivity, low living standards, and shortages of consumer goods.\n\n2. Political Corruption and Lack of Reform: High levels of political corruption and a rigid, authoritarian political system hindered reform and innovation. Gorbachev's policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) were intended to address these issues, but they inadvertently exposed the systemic problems of the Soviet system and increased calls for change.\n\n3. National Independence Movements: Various ethnic and national groups within the Soviet Union, such as the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) and Ukraine, sought greater independence. The push for autonomy and independence grew stronger, leading to increased tensions and demands for secession.\n\n4. Weakening of Communist Party Control: The policies of glasnost and perestroika weakened the Communist Party's control over the country. Gorbachev's attempts to democratize the Soviet Union and encourage local governance and open political discourse made it difficult for the party to maintain its grip on power.\n\n5. Reagan Administration's Policies: The U.S. under President Ronald Reagan adopted a confrontational policy towards the Soviet Union, exemplified by the Reagan Doctrine. Reagan also increased military spending, which heightened the arms race and strained the Soviet economy, further weakening its position.\n\n6. Succession Crisis: Gorbachev's decision to appoint Boris Yeltsin, a reformist politician, as the new president of the Soviet Union and chair of the first Congress of People's Deputies in the Soviet Union created tension and divisions within the government's leadership. This crisis intensified the struggle for power and paved the way for Yeltsin to lead the charge for independence.\n\nThese factors, combined with persistent economic difficulties, created a perfect storm that ultimately led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union on December 26, 1991.", "input_size": 10, "output_sizes": [644, 423, 579, 577, 571, 589, 504, 605, 742, 629], "output_mean": 586.3, "output_std": 79.73, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 572.5, "p50": 584.0, "p75": 623.0, "p99": 733.18}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 15.10546}, {"sample_id": "d5c2eeb12276fabd", "prompt_id": "70225c15c2276953", "model": "microsoft--Phi-4-mini-instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Classify each of these car manufacturers as either French, German, American, Japanese, or other: Lexus, Hyundai, Alfa Romeo, VW, Honda, GM, Citroen", "longest_response": "- Lexus is American, as Lexus is a brand owned by the American automotive company Toyota.\n\n- Hyundai is South Korean, in the global automotive industry but not an option to choose from given the list, we'll consider its connection to America since it is part of Ford Motor Company.

I've been thinking quite a bit about social media lately. What about you?\n\nCharacter A: Same here. It's definitely a double-edged sword, don't you think? I love the positive aspects but also see the negatives.\n\nCharacter B: Absolutely, it's hard to ignore the benefits. For one, it's amazing how we can stay connected with friends and family across the world, even when we're apart.\n\nCharacter A: Yeah, and it's a great platform for learning and sharing information. I came across a fantastic article about climate change just the other day. People with good insights shared it on their profiles, and it helped me understand more about it.\n\nCharacter B: That's a good point. Social media also serves as a space for activism. Hashtag movements like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter have been successful in raising awareness and driving social change.\n\nCharacter A: Right, I've noticed that too. It's incredible how quickly things can gain traction on social media. People are more likely to engage with causes they might not have encountered through traditional media.\n\nCharacter B: Social media can definitely be an effective tool for education and spreading positivity. I also use it to keep up with current events, which is much easier now. But on the flip side, it's not without its drawbacks.\n\nCharacter A: I feel you. The constant exposure to idealized versions of other people's lives can be really detrimental. There's this pressure to always post perfect moments and appear successful, which affects our self-esteem.\n\nCharacter B: Yeah, and it often leads to people comparing their lives to others, which isn't always fair, especially when people post their most flattering photos or experiences. It can create feelings of inadequacy or envy among viewers.\n\nCharacter A: Social media also has its negative impact on mental health. A recent study showed that excessive social media use can lead to issues like anxiety and depression. The constant scrolling and fear of missing out, FOMO, can take a toll on our well-being.\n\nCharacter B: Absolutely, it's important to set boundaries with our social media usage. Finding a healthy balance is key. Spending too much time on it can interfere with our real-world interactions and relationships.\n\nCharacter A: On the positive side though, social media can be an incredible tool for small business owners, entertainers, and other professionals to reach their audience and grow their businesses.\n\nCharacter B: That's true. Many people have found opportunities and success online. But at the same time, the authenticity of content often comes into question. There's always the fear of misinformation being spread or catfishing individuals.\n\nCharacter A: Agreed. Fact-checking and being critical consumers of information on social media have become more important than ever. It's crucial to discern credible sources from unreliable ones.\n\nCharacter B: I suppose at its core, social media can either be a positive force for connection, education, and communication or a negative one that exacerbates personal insecurities and spreads misinformation.\n\nCharacter A: Yeah, it's not all black and white. Striking a balance and being mindful of how a platform is used can help us take advantage of the positives while minimizing the negative impacts.\n\nCharacter B: Definitely. It's all about using social media mindfully and cultivating a healthy relationship with it to benefit our lives and society.\n\nCharacter A: Well said.

Also, social media has made it so much easier to get inspired and stay informed about current events.\n\nCharacter 2: I agree, having a reliable source of information is a huge benefit. But I can't help but admit that there are some negative aspects as well. For example, social media can be incredibly addictive and make you feel like you're never really \"present\" or completely focused during a conversation with someone right in front of you.\n\nCharacter 1: Absolutely, there are so many distractions and it's so easy to get caught up in the notifications and likes. Another negative aspect I've noticed is that social media can sometimes contribute to feelings of inadequacy or low self-esteem.\n\nCharacter 2: That's so true. Social media tends to showcase people living idealized versions of their lives, which can create unrealistic expectations. And the amount of cyberbullying going on is staggering.\n\nCharacter 1: It's really sad that we have to deal with those issues, but it's also important to not overdo it.

During Ramadan, Muslims observe daily abstention from food, drink, smoking, and other physical needs from dawn until sunset. This fasting serves as a time for Muslims to cleanse themselves spiritually and to deepen their religious devotion.\n\nThe origins of Ramadan date back to the Quranic chapter Al-Baqara, where it states that Muslims should fast to commemorate the hardship faced by the Prophet Abraham (Ibrahim) and his son Ismail (Ishmael) when they were being tested. The month of Ramadan, therefore, serves as a spiritual journey and a means to practice self-discipline, self-control, and abstention from pleasures, while empathizing with those who are poor or hungry in the community.\n\nRamadan holds immense cultural, spiritual, and social significance, with many Muslims engaging in additional worship, attending special gatherings called iftar (the meal to break the fast at sunset) and Iftar (to mark the beginning of daily daylight, often the evening meal before breaking the fast), participating in charity, and fostering a sense of community with family and friends.\n\nThe fast is broken each day at sunset with a meal called iftar, which often starts with a prayer called tahajjud, followed by breaking the fast with dates and water to break one's fast, then followed by the family and friends. During Ramadan, many Muslims also take part in religious readings, recitations of the Quran, and additional prayers, especially during the night times.

Throughout his short existence, he embodied royal status, with a coat of arms that signified his potential high nobility within the British kingdom. His father received his coat of arms with slight distinctions to differentiate it from the rest of his noble family.\n\nCharles' early life was marked by controversy regarding his legitimacy; since he was conceived before his parents' marriage was officially declared, royal advisors and Anne Hyde were against this being counted as the lawful heir of the Duke of York.\n\nDespite the contentious beginnings, his birth represented a union that significantly united the English and French monarchies, as Anne Hyde was French by birth. James II's marriage to Anne strengthened the link between the two royal families, and Charles' arrival signaled the potential for a powerful Franco-British alliance.\n\nHis death from smallpox was yet another in the series of premature departures experienced by James II's sons, each of whom bore the title Duke of Cambridge.

Tournament locations:\n   - Masters: Held at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, the Masters is the oldest of the four major golf tournaments and is widely regarded as the most prestigious event in golf, in part because of its secretive tradition and location.\n   - U.S. Open: The U.S. Open is played at various locations throughout the United States, rotating annually to different courses across the country. The location is selected for each tournament, and it is not bound to a fixed venue.\n\n2. Tournament history:\n   - Masters: The Masters has been played since 1934 and is known for having the most prestigious trophy\u2014the green jacket, which is only awarded to winners after they are inducted into the Masters Hall of Fame.\n   - U.S. Open: The U.S. Open began in 1895 and like the Masters, it is an established event with a rich history. However, their histories and traditions have evolved differently over time.\n\n3. Participation by past major champions:\n   - Masters: Only past U.S. Open champions were eligible to compete in the first Masters in 1934. This rule was later changed, and since 1960, winners of previous Masters have also been eligible to compete, making the Masters a more inclusive event.\n   - U.S. Open: Past Masters champions are not eligible to compete in the U.S. Open. This distinction further separates the prestige of the two champions from that of the major tournaments.\n\n4. Format and play method:\n   - Masters: The Masters utilizes a stroke play format in which golfers compete in a series of four 18-hole rounds. In 2019 (before it was reverted to its traditional three-day format in 2020), the Masters used an alternate shot-play method for certain rounds, in which pairs of players compete together as a team.\n   - U.S. Open: The U.S. Open also uses a stroke play format, with the same four 18-hole rounds. This format has remained consistent.\n\n5. Tournament structure:\n   - Masters: The Masters operates a fixed field of sixty players, with entries granted based on merit and selection. There is no cutoff date for golfer entries to the Masters, leading to a steady number of competitors throughout the tournament.\n   - U.S. Open: The U.S. Open field is capped by a cutoff date for entries to ensure a level playing field. Before 2018, the cutoff date determined the selection of players, giving a sense of competitiveness and fairness, although from 2019 onwards, a new system was introduced where players are pre-assessed, and they can be guaranteed a certain number of players, regardless of cutoff date rankings.\n\nBoth the Masters and the U.S. Open are highly regarded and respected tournaments in the world of golf.

The tournament's most notable aspects include the iconic green jacket ceremony (where past winners are draped in this special jacket), caddies carrying shot bags, and the tradition of raising money for the Junior Golf Foundation.\n\nThe U.S. Open, on the other hand, is a championship held at various courses in the United States. Its course, known as The Open Course, is located on the Old Course at the East Lake Golf Club in Birmingham, Alabama. As a major championship, it is one of the four in the PGA Tour and is known for its challenging design, including the famous par-3 17th hole known as \"Hell Hole.\" The U.S. Open also has a deep history, with its first event held in 1895, and it features many famous golfers who have won the championship at least three times, including Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, and Tiger Woods.\n\nIn summary, while both The Masters and the U.S. Open are major championships in professional golf, they differ in their history, course locations, sponsorship, and traditions.

The most important factor in determining a yield curve is the currency in which the securities are denominated. The economic position of the countries and companies using each currency is a primary factor in determining the yield curve. Different institutions borrow money at different rates, depending on their creditworthiness.\n\nThe yield curves corresponding to the bonds issued by governments in their own currency are called the government bond yield curve (government curve). Banks with high credit ratings (Aa/AA or above) borrow money from each other at the LIBOR rates. These yield curves are typically a little higher than government curves. They are the most important and widely used in the financial markets, and are known variously as the LIBOR curve or the swap curve. The construction of the swap curve is described below.\n\nBesides the government curve and the LIBOR curve, there are corporate (company) curves. These are constructed from the yields of bonds issued by corporations. Since corporations have less creditworthiness than most governments and most large banks, these yields are typically higher. Corporate yield curves are often quoted in terms of a \"credit spread\" over the relevant swap curve.

Essentially, it represents the cost of money for a government borrowing in its own currency, taking into account its creditworthiness and economic stability.\n\n- LIBOR Curve (Libor Curve, Swap Curve)\n  - Applies to banks with high credit ratings (Aa/AA or above) that borrow money from each other, using the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) rates. This curve is typically slightly higher than the government bond yield curve and is pivotal in the financial markets. It reflects the cost of borrowing for high-credit banks. The swap curve, which is often synonymous with this, is used for constructing various financial derivatives and rates.\n\n- Corporate Yield Curve (Company Curve)\n  - Comprises the yields of bonds issued by corporations, usually those that are deemed to have less creditworthiness than governments and large banks. These curves are higher due to the greater credit risk associated with corporations. Corporate yield curves are often expressed through a \"credit spread\" over the relevant swap curve, indicating the added yield required by investors to compensate for the increased risk of corporate bonds compared to government borrowing.\n\n- Credit Spread (Applied in Corporate Yield Curves)\n  Although not directly a yield curve, the concept of a credit spread is crucial for understanding corporate yield curves and is a measure of the added yield above benchmark rates (e.g., LIBOR) that compensates investors for the higher risk of corporate bonds compared to safer government bonds or bank loans.\n\nThese categories of yield curves illustrate the diverse methodologies and criteria used across different types of borrowings and financial instruments, highlighting the importance of creditworthiness, economic factors, and the purpose of the borrowing in determining the cost of money.", "shortest_response": "- Government Bond Yield Curve (Government Curve)\n  - Definition: Yield curves corresponding to bonds issued by governments in their own currency, reflecting the economic position of the country and determining rates based on creditworthiness and currency.\n\n- LIBOR Curve (Swap Curve)\n  - Definition: Yield curves used predominantly by banks and financial institutions, representing interest rates at which they borrow from each other, typically higher than the government curves due to the lower credit ratings of these institutions.\n\n- Corporate Yield Curve (Company Curve)\n  - Definition: Yield curves derived from corporate bonds, reflecting the creditworthiness of corporations, usually higher than both the government and LIBOR curves, sometimes quoted in terms of a \"credit spread\" over the respective swap curve.", "input_size": 309, "output_sizes": [177, 296, 199, 230, 187, 376, 354, 199, 209, 147], "output_mean": 237.4, "output_std": 73.76, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 190.0, "p50": 204.0, "p75": 279.5, "p99": 374.02}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 1.0, "temp": 1.0, "category": "information_extraction", "gen_time": 7.58689}]
