The `is_coprime` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. It defines a nested function `gcd` to calculate the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.\n3. The `gcd` function iteratively replaces `x` and `y` with `y` and the remainder of `x` divided by `y` until `y` becomes 0.\n4. The `is_coprime` function then checks if the GCD is 1. If it is, the numbers are co-prime, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nYou can use this function to check if any two numbers are co-prime. For example:\n```python\nprint(is_coprime(12, 15))  # False\nprint(is_coprime(17, 23))  # True\n```", "shortest_response": "Certainly!

This algorithm iteratively replaces `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes zero.\n* The `is_coprime` function then uses the `gcd` function to check if the GCD of the two input numbers `a` and `b` is equal to 1. If the GCD is 1, it means the numbers are co-prime, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n* This approach is efficient because the Euclidean algorithm has a relatively low time complexity, making it suitable for large inputs.", "input_size": 110, "output_sizes": [322, 273, 246, 341, 404, 299, 337, 298, 304, 350], "output_mean": 317.4, "output_std": 41.82, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 298.25, "p50": 313.0, "p75": 340.0, "p99": 399.14}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 53.82254}, {"sample_id": "c6b19f66f5f70e10", "prompt_id": "007cf0a828525d2d", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct", "dataset": "Mbpp", "prompt_text": "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task: Write a function to find the area of a rombus.

Here is the solution:\n\n```python\ndef most_occurrences(strings):\n    word_count = {}\n    for string in strings:\n        words = string.split()\n        for word in words:\n            word = word.lower()\n            if word in word_count:\n                word_count[word] += 1\n            else:\n                word_count[word] = 1\n    return max(word_count, key=word_count.get)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `most_occurrences` initializes an empty dictionary `word_count` to store the count of each word. It then iterates over each string in the input list, splitting the string into words.\n* For each word, it converts the word to lowercase using `word.lower()` to ensure the count is case-insensitive. It then checks if the word is already in the `word_count` dictionary. If it is, it increments the count; otherwise, it adds the word to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n* Finally, the function uses the `max` function with the `key` argument set to `word_count.get` to find the word with the highest count in the `word_count` dictionary and returns it.\n* Note that if there are multiple words with the same highest count, this function will return one of them. If you need to return all words with the highest count, you would need to modify the function accordingly.", "shortest_response": "Absolutely!

If it's not, the function immediately returns `False`.\n* If the length check passes, the function then iterates over `s1` in steps of the length of `s2`, checking if each substring of `s1` matches `s2`.\n* If any of these substrings don't match `s2`, the function returns `False`.\n* If the function completes the loop without finding any mismatches, it returns `True`, indicating that `s1` is a concatenation of `s2`.", "input_size": 110, "output_sizes": [312, 252, 279, 283, 313, 298, 314, 276, 274, 280], "output_mean": 288.1, "output_std": 19.45, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 276.75, "p50": 281.5, "p75": 308.5, "p99": 313.91}, "top_k": 50, "top_p": 0.9, "temp": 0.6, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 41.15352}, {"sample_id": "749438ac0ec689ee", "prompt_id": "13d2db00e7956833", "model": "meta-llama--Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct", "dataset": "Mbpp", "prompt_text": "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task: Write a function to access the initial and last data of the given tuple record.

We should repeat the string until the length of the repeated string is equal to or greater than the index of the last character in the unit test.\n\n### Repeated String Character Counter with Variable Length and Index\n\n```python\ndef count_Char(s, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the occurrences of a character in a repeated string.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The original string.\n    char (str): The character to count.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The number of occurrences of the character in the repeated string.\n    \"\"\"\n    repeated_s = ''\n    index = 0\n    while index < max([ord(c) for c in s]) + 1:\n        repeated_s += s\n        index += len(s)\n    return repeated_s.count(char)\n```\n\nHowever, the above function is not correct as it does not consider the actual index in the string but the ASCII value of the characters.\n\n### Correct Repeated String Character Counter\n\n```python\ndef count_Char(s, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the occurrences of a character in a repeated string.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The original string.\n    char (str): The character to count.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The number of occurrences of the character in the repeated string.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = max([s.count(c) * 10 + s[:10 % len(s)].count(c) for c in set(s)])\n    repeated_s = s * (n // len(s)) + s[:n % len(s)]\n    return repeated_s.count(char)\n```\n\nHowever, the above function is still not correct as it does not consider the actual index in the string.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n```python\ndef count_Char(s, char):\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the occurrences of a character in a repeated string.\n\n    Args:\n    s (str): The original string.\n    char (str): The character to count.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The number of occurrences of the character in the repeated string.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(10 * len(s)):\n        if s[i % len(s)] == char:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the range of indices in the repeated string and checking if the character at the current index is equal to the target character. If it is, it increments the count. The `%` operator is used to wrap around to the beginning of the string when the index exceeds the length of the string.", "shortest_response": "```python\ndef count_Char(s, char):\n    count = 0\n    for c in s:\n        if c == char:\n            count += 1\n    return count * 7\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `count_Char` takes two parameters: `s` (the input string) and `char` (the character to be counted).\n* It iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. If `c` matches the target character `char`, it increments the `count` variable.\n* After counting all occurrences of `char` in `s`, it returns the count multiplied by 7, assuming the string `s` is repeated 7 times.\n* This solution assumes that the string `s` is repeated a fixed number of times (in this case, 7).

Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef add_dict_to_tuple(tup, dict):\n    return tup + (dict,)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n* The function `add_dict_to_tuple` takes two parameters: `tup` (the input tuple) and `dict` (the dictionary to be added).\n* It uses the `+` operator to concatenate the input tuple `tup` with a new tuple containing the dictionary `dict`. The comma after `dict` in `(dict,)` is necessary to create a tuple with one element.\n* The result is a new tuple that includes the original elements from `tup` and the dictionary `dict` as the last element.\n* This approach works because tuples in Python are immutable, so we cannot modify the original tuple. Instead, we create a new tuple that includes the additional element.", "shortest_response": "Of course!
