The `filter` function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef filter_evennumbers(nums):\n    # Use filter with a lambda function to check if a number is even\n    even_nums = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums)\n    # Convert the filter object to a list before returning\n    return list(even_nums)\n\n# Test cases\nassert filter_evennumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\nassert filter_evennumbers([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]) == [10, 20, 84]\nassert filter_evennumbers([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]) == [8, 6, 4]\n```\n\nIn this solution:\n- The `lambda x: x % 2 == 0` function checks if a number is even.\n- The `filter` function applies this lambda function to each element in the input list `nums`.\n- The result of `filter` is a filter object, which is then converted to a list to get the final output.", "input_size": 170, "output_sizes": [319, 382, 348, 381, 381, 335, 325, 383, 336, 372], "output_mean": 356.2, "output_std": 24.79, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 335.25, "p50": 360.0, "p75": 381.0, "p99": 382.91}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "undefined", "gen_time": 27.67533}, {"sample_id": "3b5901f7742db872", "prompt_id": "3999a053ddcd73c3", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct", "dataset": "Mbpp", "prompt_text": "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task: Write a function to calculate a grid of hexagon coordinates where function returns a list of lists containing 6 tuples of x, y point coordinates.
