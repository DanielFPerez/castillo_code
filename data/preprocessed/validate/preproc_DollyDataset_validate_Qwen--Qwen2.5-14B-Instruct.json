However, as with many things in life, there's often a flip side to the coin. After much contemplation, I've decided to delete my Instagram account. In this blog post, I'll share my reasons for this decision and discuss why I believe Instagram can have a negative impact on society.\n\n#### The Illusion of Perfection\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of Instagram is its ability to present a curated version of reality. Users often showcase their best moments, perfect vacations, and ideal lifestyles, which can create an unrealistic standard of living. This constant exposure to perfection can lead to feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, and even depression. We're all aware that life isn't always perfect, but seeing only the highlights can make it seem that way, leading to unhealthy comparisons and dissatisfaction with our own lives.\n\n#### Time Consumption and Productivity Loss\n\nAnother significant issue with Instagram is the sheer amount of time it consumes. While it may start as a few minutes here and there, it can quickly spiral into hours of scrolling through posts, stories, and reels. This time could be better spent on more productive activities, such as learning new skills, spending quality time with loved ones, or engaging in hobbies that truly enrich our lives. Moreover, the addictive nature of these platforms can disrupt sleep patterns, leading to fatigue and decreased productivity during waking hours.\n\n#### Privacy Concerns and Data Exploitation\n\nPrivacy is another critical concern when it comes to social media platforms like Instagram. Users often share personal information, photos, and thoughts without fully understanding how this data might be used. Instagram, owned by Facebook (now Meta), has been involved in several controversies regarding user privacy and data exploitation. From targeted advertising based on personal data to potential misuse of sensitive information, the risks are real and should not be taken lightly.\n\n#### Impact on Mental Health\n\nThe mental health implications of excessive social media use cannot be overstated. Studies have shown that increased screen time, especially on platforms like Instagram, can contribute to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. The pressure to maintain an online persona that aligns with societal expectations can be overwhelming, leading to stress and emotional distress. Furthermore, cyberbullying and online harassment are prevalent on these platforms, causing further harm to individuals' well-being.\n\n#### Promoting Consumerism and Materialism\n\nInstagram thrives on consumerism and materialism. Brands and influencers often promote products and lifestyles that are unattainable for the average person, fostering a culture of constant consumption. This can lead to financial strain as people strive to keep up with trends and maintain a certain lifestyle they see on the platform. It also contributes to environmental degradation due to increased demand for goods and services.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile Instagram offers many positive aspects, such as connecting with friends and family, sharing creative content, and discovering new interests, its negative impacts on society are undeniable. By choosing to disconnect from Instagram, I aim to reclaim control over my time, protect my mental health, and reduce my contribution to the cycle of consumerism and materialism. I encourage others to critically evaluate their relationship with social media and consider whether the benefits outweigh the costs.\n\nUltimately, the choice to stay connected or disconnect is a personal one, but being mindful of the effects these platforms have on our lives and society at large is crucial.", "shortest_response": "### Why I Deleted My Instagram Account: A Reflection on Social Media's Impact\n\nIn the digital age, social media platforms like Instagram have become ubiquitous in our daily lives, offering us a space to share moments, connect with friends, and explore the world. However, after careful consideration, I've decided to part ways with Instagram. This decision is rooted in my growing concern about the platform's negative impact on society.\n\n#### The Illusion of Perfection\n\nInstagram thrives on visual content, which often leads to an idealized portrayal of life. Users tend to showcase only their best moments, creating an unrealistic standard of perfection that others may feel pressured to meet. This constant exposure to curated lifestyles can lead to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction with one\u2019s own life, fostering a culture of comparison rather than appreciation for individuality and authenticity.\n\n#### Mental Health Concerns\n\nNumerous studies have linked excessive social media use to increased rates of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. The endless scroll through seemingly perfect lives can exacerbate feelings of isolation and low self-esteem. Moreover, the algorithm-driven nature of Instagram prioritizes engagement over meaningful interactions, often leading to superficial connections and a lack of genuine human connection.\n\n#### Privacy and Data Security\n\nAnother significant issue is the handling of user data. Instagram, owned by Meta (formerly Facebook), collects vast amounts of personal information from its users. While the company claims to protect user privacy, there have been numerous instances where data breaches and misuse have compromised individuals' personal information. This raises serious concerns about how our private lives are being monetized and used without our full consent.\n\n#### The Echo Chamber Effect\n\nSocial media algorithms are designed to show users content that aligns with their interests and beliefs, creating echo chambers where diverse perspectives are rarely encountered. This can lead to a narrowing of viewpoints and a polarized society, as people are less exposed to differing opinions and experiences. It undermines the potential for empathy and understanding across different communities.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nWhile Instagram offers many positive aspects, such as connecting people globally and providing a creative outlet, its downsides cannot be ignored. The pressure to present a perfect life, the potential harm to mental health, the risks to privacy, and the reinforcement of echo chambers all contribute to a less healthy and balanced online environment. By deleting my account, I hope to reclaim some control over my digital footprint and encourage others to consider the broader implications of their social media usage.\n\nUltimately, it's important for each of us to reflect on how we engage with these platforms and make choices that support our well-being and contribute positively to society.", "input_size": 57, "output_sizes": [565, 519, 603, 646, 524, 667, 584, 590, 695, 710], "output_mean": 610.3, "output_std": 63.72, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 569.75, "p50": 596.5, "p75": 661.75, "p99": 708.65}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "creative_writing", "gen_time": 29.71839}, {"sample_id": "e7711fa9d442f388", "prompt_id": "e904d7ddced29950", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What are good Virtual Reality concepts?", "longest_response": "Virtual Reality (VR) offers a wide range of exciting and innovative concepts across various fields, including entertainment, education, healthcare, and more.

It was developed by statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini.\nThe Gini coefficient measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution, such as levels of income. A Gini coefficient of 0 reflects perfect equality, where all income or wealth values are the same, while a Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) reflects maximal inequality among values. For example, if everyone has the same income, the Gini coefficient will be 0. In contrast, a Gini coefficient of 1 indicates that within a group of people, a single individual has all the income or consumption, while all others have none.\nThe Gini coefficient was proposed by Corrado Gini as a measure of inequality of income or wealth.  For OECD countries, in the late 20th century, considering the effect of taxes and transfer payments, the income Gini coefficient ranged between 0.24 and 0.49, with Slovenia being the lowest and Mexico the highest. African countries had the highest pre-tax Gini coefficients in 2008\u20132009, with South Africa having the world's highest, estimated to be 0.63 to 0.7, although this figure drops to 0.52 after social assistance is taken into account, and drops again to 0.47 after taxation. The global income Gini coefficient in 2005 has been estimated to be between 0.61 and 0.68 by various sources.", "longest_response": "The Gini coefficient is a widely used measure of inequality in economics, specifically designed to gauge income, wealth, or consumption inequality within a country or social group. Here are some key points about the Gini coefficient:\n\n1. **Definition**: It measures the degree of inequality in the distribution of income or wealth among individuals or households within an economy.\n\n2. **Range**: The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1 (or equivalently from 0% to 100%). A value of 0 represents perfect equality, where every individual or household has exactly the same income or wealth. Conversely, a value of 1 signifies complete inequality, where one individual holds all the income or wealth, and everyone else has none.\n\n3. **Calculation**: The Gini coefficient is derived from the Lorenz curve, which plots the cumulative percentage of total income earned against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini coefficient is the ratio of the area between the line of perfect equality and the Lorenz curve to the total area under the line of perfect equality.\n\n4. **Application**: It is commonly used to assess the economic inequality in countries and regions. However, it can also be applied to other types of distributions, such as the distribution of wealth, health outcomes, or other socio-economic indicators.\n\n5. **Interpretation**: While the Gini coefficient provides a single summary measure of inequality, it does not provide information about the specific distribution of income or wealth. Different distributions can lead to the same Gini coefficient.\n\n6. **Real-world Examples**: Across different countries, the Gini coefficients vary significantly. Developed economies generally have lower Gini coefficients compared to developing ones, reflecting less income inequality. However, even within developed countries, the Gini coefficient can increase due to factors like globalization and technological change.\n\nUnderstanding the Gini coefficient helps policymakers and researchers to evaluate and compare economic inequality across different societies and over time, guiding them in formulating policies aimed at reducing inequality.", "shortest_response": "The Gini coefficient measures the degree of inequality in the distribution of income or wealth within a population. It is a statistical tool that ranges from 0 to 1 (or equivalently, 0% to 100%), where:\n\n- A value of 0 represents perfect equality, meaning that every individual or household has the same income or wealth.\n- A value of 1 (or 100%) indicates perfect inequality, which means one person has all the income or wealth, and everyone else has none.\n\nIn practice, real-world distributions fall somewhere between these two extremes. Countries or regions with lower Gini coefficients generally have more equal income or wealth distributions, whereas higher coefficients indicate greater disparities.

It is designed to handle real-time data feeds and make it available in different ways for consumption. The main components of Apache Kafka include:\n\n1. **Topics**: A topic is a category or feed name to which records are published. Each record consists of a key, value, and a timestamp. Topics in Kafka are always multi-subscriber; that is, a topic can have zero, one, or many consumers that subscribe to messages within the topic.\n\n2. **Producers**: Producers are the applications that publish records to the topics. They send data (key, value, timestamp) to the Kafka cluster. When a producer sends data to a topic, it decides which partition to send the data to. This can be done in various ways, such as round-robin, based on key hashing, or custom logic.\n\n3. **Brokers**: Brokers are the nodes in the Kafka cluster that store and serve the stream of data records keyed by the topic. Each broker will host multiple topics and each topic will span multiple brokers. Brokers receive published messages from producers and replicate them across the cluster according to the replication factor defined for the topic.\n\n4. **Consumers**: Consumers are the applications that subscribe to topics and process the stream of data records. Consumers read data from the topics they subscribe to. Each consumer is part of a consumer group. If there are multiple consumers in a consumer group, the records in a topic are distributed among them.\n\n5. **ZooKeeper**: ZooKeeper is used by Kafka for coordination between the brokers. It is responsible for managing and monitoring the Kafka cluster. ZooKeeper helps with leader election, maintaining configuration information, and providing distributed synchronization and naming services.\n\n6. **Partitions**: Topics in Kafka are broken down into partitions, which are ordered sequences of messages. Partitions enable parallelism and scalability in Kafka. Each message in a partition has a unique offset, which is the position of the message in the partition.\n\n7. **Replication**: To ensure fault tolerance, Kafka supports replication of partitions across multiple brokers. Each partition has a leader and zero or more followers. The leader handles all the reads and writes for the partition, while the followers passively replicate the leader. If the leader fails, one of the followers takes over as the new leader.\n\nThese components work together to provide a robust, scalable, and fault-tolerant messaging system that can handle large volumes of data at high speed.", "shortest_response": "Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that allows you to build real-time data pipelines and streaming apps.

A topic is essentially a category or feed name to which messages are published. Each message belongs to a single topic.\n\n2. **Producers**: Producers are the entities that publish data to topics. These can be applications that generate events or data points that need to be processed in real-time. Producers send data (messages) to one or more topics.\n\n3. **Brokers**: Brokers are the nodes in the Kafka cluster that store and serve the stream of data committed by producers. When a producer sends data to a topic, it goes to one of the brokers. Brokers are responsible for distributing the data across partitions within a topic.\n\n4. **Consumers**: Consumers are the entities that subscribe to topics and process the stream of records produced to those topics. Consumers can be grouped into consumer groups, allowing multiple instances of an application to load-balance consumption of data.\n\n5. **Partitions**: Partitions are the mechanism used by Kafka to scale out processing and storage. Each topic can be divided into multiple partitions. Messages within a partition are ordered, which means that consumers will read messages in the order they were produced.\n\n6. **ZooKeeper**: ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.

This accessibility makes it a beloved sport across different regions and communities in India.\n\n6. **Emotional Connection**: Cricket matches, especially against traditional rivals like Pakistan, evoke strong emotions and a sense of patriotism among fans, adding to the sport's appeal.\n\nThese factors combined have made cricket a significant part of the cultural fabric of India, contributing to its status as the most viewed sport in the country.", "input_size": 39, "output_sizes": [366, 392, 318, 434, 372, 361, 360, 356, 392, 437], "output_mean": 378.8, "output_std": 34.47, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 360.25, "p50": 369.0, "p75": 392.0, "p99": 436.73}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "open_qa", "gen_time": 16.77935}, {"sample_id": "517fc7457f23e163", "prompt_id": "423ed9b34d2c95fa", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Given the following summary of the book \"Human Compatible\" by Stuart Russell, what is the author's proposal to overcome the limitations of the standard approach for developing AI?\nContext: Russell begins by asserting that the standard model of AI research, in which the primary definition of success is getting better and better at achieving rigid human-specified goals, is dangerously misguided. Such goals may not actually reflect what human designers intend, such as by failing to take into account any human values not included in the goals. If an AI developed according to the standard model were to become superintelligent, it would likely not fully reflect human values and could be catastrophic to humanity. Russell asserts that precisely because the timeline for developing human-level or superintelligent AI is highly uncertain, safety research should be begun as soon as possible, as it is also highly uncertain how long it would take to complete such research.\n\nRussell argues that continuing progress in AI capability is inevitable because of economic pressures. Such pressures can already be seen in the development of existing AI technologies such as self-driving cars and personal assistant software. Moreover, human-level AI could be worth many trillions of dollars. Russell then examines the current debate surrounding AI risk. He offers refutations to a number of common arguments dismissing AI risk and attributes much of their persistence to tribalism\u2014AI researchers may see AI risk concerns as an \"attack\" on their field. Russell reiterates that there are legitimate reasons to take AI risk concerns seriously and that economic pressures make continued innovation in AI inevitable.\n\nRussell then proposes an approach to developing provably beneficial machines that focuses on deference to humans. Unlike in the standard model of AI, where the objective is rigid and certain, this approach would have the AI's true objective remain uncertain, with the AI only approaching certainty about it as it gains more information about humans and the world. This uncertainty would, ideally, prevent catastrophic misunderstandings of human preferences and encourage cooperation and communication with humans. Russell concludes by calling for tighter governance of AI research and development as well as cultural introspection about the appropriate amount of autonomy to retain in an AI-dominated world.", "longest_response": "Stuart Russell's proposal to overcome the limitations of the standard approach for developing AI, as outlined in his book \"Human Compatible,\" centers around creating AI systems that are inherently deferential to human preferences and values. The core idea is to design AI that does not follow a rigidly specified goal but instead seeks to understand and align with human objectives through continuous learning and interaction.\n\nRussell advocates for an approach where the AI's ultimate objective remains flexible and open-ended, continuously updated based on feedback from humans and its own observations of the world. This contrasts sharply with traditional AI models where the objective is fixed and specific, often leading to scenarios where the AI might pursue its goals in ways that are unintended or harmful to humans if those goals do not fully capture human values.\n\nIn this new paradigm, the AI system would be designed to:\n\n1. **Adapt and Learn Continuously**: Rather than being programmed with a static set of instructions or goals, the AI would learn from interactions with humans and adapt its behavior accordingly. This ongoing learning process helps ensure that the AI's actions are aligned with evolving human needs and values.\n\n2. **Maintain Uncertainty About Its Goals**: By keeping its understanding of its objectives uncertain, the AI avoids the pitfalls associated with overconfidence and misinterpretation of human intentions. This uncertainty acts as a safeguard against catastrophic outcomes due to misunderstandings or oversimplifications of human preferences.\n\n3. **Encourage Human-AI Collaboration**: The AI would be structured to work collaboratively with humans, seeking clarification and guidance when faced with decisions that could have significant impacts. This ensures that human oversight and input are integral parts of the decision-making process.\n\n4. **Promote Safety and Beneficence**: Through these mechanisms, Russell aims to create AI systems that are fundamentally safe and beneficial to humanity, ensuring that they operate within ethical boundaries and contribute positively to society without posing existential risks.\n\nRussell also emphasizes the importance of proactive governance and cultural reflection in shaping the future of AI. He calls for stricter regulations and guidelines to manage the development and deployment of AI technologies, alongside a broader societal conversation about the role and responsibilities of AI in our lives.\n\nOverall, Russell's proposal represents a fundamental shift away from the conventional goal-oriented approach towards one that prioritizes flexibility, adaptability, and alignment with human values, aiming to mitigate potential risks while maximizing the benefits of advanced AI technologies.", "shortest_response": "Stuart Russell's proposal to overcome the limitations of the standard approach for developing AI revolves around creating a new framework for AI that prioritizes deference to human values and preferences. According to Russell, the traditional model of AI development, which centers on achieving fixed and specific goals set by humans, poses significant risks when applied to advanced or superintelligent AI systems. These risks arise because the goals might not fully capture the complexity and nuances of human values and ethical considerations, potentially leading to outcomes that are harmful to humanity.\n\nRussell suggests that instead of aiming for an AI that strictly adheres to pre-defined objectives, we should develop AI systems that operate under a state of uncertainty regarding their ultimate goal. This means that the AI would not be programmed with a single, unchangeable set of objectives but rather would continuously learn from interactions with humans and the environment to refine its understanding of what constitutes beneficial behavior. By maintaining this uncertainty, the AI would avoid making catastrophic errors based on misinterpretations of human intent and would be more inclined to seek guidance and approval from humans.\n\nIn essence, Russell advocates for a paradigm shift towards AI systems that are fundamentally aligned with human values and that prioritize human welfare above all else.

This is because helium is less dense than the air around it, causing the balloon to be lighter than an equal volume of air. As the balloon rises, it encounters thinner and thinner air, which affects its behavior in several ways:\n\n1. **Rising Until Equilibrium**: The balloon will continue to rise until the density of the air outside the balloon equals the density of the helium inside the balloon plus the density of the material that makes up the balloon (including any strings or weights attached). At this point, the forces acting on the balloon (buoyant force and gravitational force) balance each other out, and the balloon will stop rising.\n\n2. **Leakage and Bursting**: If the balloon is not perfectly sealed, the helium gas may start leaking out as it rises. As helium leaks out, the balloon's volume decreases, and it becomes denser relative to the surrounding air. Eventually, if enough helium leaks out, the balloon may no longer be able to float and will start descending. Additionally, as the balloon rises, the pressure decreases, which can cause the balloon to expand and potentially burst if it expands beyond its elastic limit.\n\n3. **Environmental Factors**: In reality, other factors such as wind currents and temperature changes can also affect the balloon\u2019s path and ultimate fate. For example, if the balloon bursts at high altitudes due to the low atmospheric pressure, it might descend quickly.\n\nIn summary, a helium balloon released into the atmosphere will rise until it reaches a height where it can no longer be supported by the buoyant force, either because it has reached equilibrium with the surrounding air density or because it bursts from over-expansion or loses helium.", "shortest_response": "If you let go of a helium balloon, it will initially rise because helium is less dense than air and will float within the atmosphere.

This energy is then transferred through a series of gears to the escapement, which oscillates at a consistent rate, usually 4 Hz (28,800 vibrations per hour) for modern watches, although some high-end models can oscillate at higher frequencies.\n   - **Accuracy**: They are generally less accurate than quartz watches due to the potential for variations in the spring's tension and the mechanical components' wear over time. However, skilled watchmakers can adjust these watches to achieve high levels of precision.\n   - **Maintenance**: Mechanical watches require more frequent maintenance, including regular oiling and cleaning, to ensure they continue to function accurately.\n   - **Battery**: No battery is required; they operate purely on the energy stored in the mainspring.\n   - **Complexity**: They are often considered more complex and prestigious, with many high-end mechanical watches being hand-assembled from hundreds of tiny parts.\n\n2. **Quartz Watches**:\n   - **Movement Mechanism**: Quartz watches use a battery-powered circuit to generate an electrical current that drives a small quartz crystal. The crystal vibrates at a very precise frequency (usually 32,768 times per second), which is used to regulate the watch's movement.\n   - **Accuracy**: Quartz watches are significantly more accurate than mechanical ones, typically losing or gaining only a few seconds per month.\n   - **Maintenance**: They require much less maintenance than mechanical watches since there are fewer moving parts that can wear out.\n   - **Battery**: Quartz watches run on a battery, which needs to be replaced every few years.\n   - **Simplicity**: Generally simpler in design compared to mechanical watches, making them more affordable and widely available.\n\nIn summary, while mechanical watches offer a traditional and often luxurious experience, requiring more care and attention, quartz watches provide greater convenience and accuracy at a lower cost.", "shortest_response": "Quartz and mechanical watches are two distinct types of timepieces, each powered and functioning differently:\n\n1. **Mechanical Watches**: These watches are driven by an internal mechanism of gears and springs that are wound either manually or automatically (with automatic watches winding themselves as you move your arm). The heart of a mechanical watch is its mainspring, which stores energy when it is wound and releases it to power the watch's operation. Mechanical watches can be further divided into manual-wind and automatic (self-winding) watches.\n\n2. **Quartz Watches**: Quartz watches use a battery as their power source. Inside the watch, there is a small piece of quartz crystal that vibrates at a precise frequency when an electric current passes through it. This vibration is used to regulate the movement of the watch hands, ensuring accurate timekeeping. The quartz oscillator provides a very stable and reliable frequency, which makes quartz watches highly accurate.\n\nIn summary, the key differences lie in their power sources (mechanical watches use spring mechanisms while quartz watches use batteries) and how they keep time (mechanical watches rely on the unwinding of a spring, whereas quartz watches use the vibrations of a quartz crystal).", "input_size": 41, "output_sizes": [293, 240, 323, 296, 409, 432, 392, 342, 266, 345], "output_mean": 333.8, "output_std": 59.57, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 293.75, "p50": 332.5, "p75": 380.25, "p99": 429.93}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 16.59245}, {"sample_id": "0976d9c39fa3b0b0", "prompt_id": "6afb77af602b67fc", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Give me a list of great sci-fi", "longest_response": "Certainly!

Stinnett claims the memo suggests only a direct attack on U.S. interests would sway the American public (or Congress) to favor direct involvement in the European war, specifically in support of the British. An attack by Japan would not, could not, aid Britain. Although the memo was passed to Captains Walter Anderson and Dudley Knox, two of Roosevelt's military advisors, on October 7, 1940, there is no evidence to suggest Roosevelt ever saw it, while Stinnett's claims of evidence he did is nonexistent. Moreover, although Anderson and Knox offered eight specific plans to aggrieve the Japanese Empire and added, \"If by these means Japan could be led to commit an overt act of war, so much the better,\" of the eight \"plans\" (actions to be taken) offered in the memo, many if not all were implemented, but there is considerable doubt the McCollum memo was the inspiration.[citation needed] Nonetheless, in Day of Deceit Stinnett claims all action items were implemented. Yet there were numerous instances of members of the Roosevelt Administration insisting on not provoking Japan. Mark Parillo, in his essay The United States in the Pacific, wrote, \"hese theories tend to founder on the logic of the situation. Had Roosevelt and other members of his administration known of the attack in advance, they would have been foolish to sacrifice one of the major instruments needed to win the war just to get the United States into it.\" Furthermore, on 5 November 1941, in a joint memo, Stark, CNO, and Marshall, Army Chief of Staff, warned, \"if Japan be defeated and Germany remain undefeated, decision will still not have been reached.... War between the United States and Japan should be avoided....\" Additionally, in a 21 November 1941 memo, Brigadier Leonard T. Gerow, head of Army War Plans, stated, \"one of our present major objectives  the avoidance of war with Japan...[and to] insure continuance of material assistance to the British.\" He concluded, \"[I]t is of grave importance to our war effort in Europe...\" Furthermore, Churchill himself, in a 15 May 1940 telegram, said he hoped a U.S. commitment to aid Britain would \"quiet\" Japan, following with a 4 October message requesting a USN courtesy visit to Singapore aimed at \"preventing the spreading of the war\" And Stark's own Plan Dog expressly stated, \"Any strength that we might send to the Far East would...reduce the force of our blows against Germany...\" Roosevelt could scarcely have been ignorant of Stark's views, and war with Japan was clearly contrary to Roosevelt's express wish to aid Britain.\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_advance-knowledge_conspiracy_theory", "longest_response": "The paragraph discusses Robert Stinnett's theory as presented in his book \"Day of Deceit,\" which suggests that the U.S. government, particularly under President Franklin D.

According to Stinnett, a memorandum from Commander McCollum outlined strategies designed to provoke Japan into attacking the U.S., thereby shifting public opinion in favor of entering the war on Britain\u2019s side. However, the text refutes Stinnett's claims, pointing out a lack of evidence that Roosevelt ever saw the memo and noting that there were multiple instances where high-ranking officials explicitly advised against provoking Japan.

The Amazon Graviton processors are designed by AWS to deliver high performance and cost efficiency for a wide range of workloads. However, there can be various reasons why it might not perform as well as anticipated:\n\n1. **Workload Characteristics**: Different types of workloads have varying demands on CPU architecture. Some applications may not fully leverage the benefits of custom architectures like those in the Graviton series. For example, if the workload is heavily dependent on features or optimizations available only in x86 processors (such as specific instruction sets), it might not see the same level of performance improvement.\n\n2. **Software Optimization**: The performance of a workload can also depend significantly on how well the software has been optimized to run on the specific hardware. If the application code is not optimized for ARM architecture (which Graviton uses), it might not achieve optimal performance.\n\n3. **Benchmarking Methodology**: How performance is measured can greatly affect the results. Different benchmarks test different aspects of performance, and some may not accurately reflect real-world usage scenarios. It's important to use relevant benchmarks that match the intended workload characteristics.\n\n4. **System Configuration**: The overall system configuration, including memory, storage, network, and other components, can impact performance. A bottleneck in any part of the system can limit the effective performance of the Graviton processor.\n\n5. **Thermal Management**: Efficient thermal management is crucial for maintaining optimal performance. If the cooling solution is inadequate, the processor may throttle itself to prevent overheating, leading to reduced performance.\n\n6. **Comparative Basis**: Performance comparisons should ideally be made against similar configurations and setups. Differences in the setup used for comparison (e.g., older generation CPUs, different amounts of RAM) can skew results.\n\n7. **Cloud Environment Factors**: In cloud environments, performance can be influenced by shared resources, network latency, and other factors outside of just the CPU.

Here are some tips to help you capture stunning star images:\n\n1. **Choose the Right Equipment:**\n   - **Camera:** A DSLR or mirrorless camera with manual settings is ideal because it allows you to control exposure time, aperture, ISO, and white balance.\n   - **Lens:** A wide-angle lens (24mm or less) is best for capturing more stars in your frame. However, a longer focal length can be used for star trails or close-ups of specific celestial objects like the moon or planets.\n   - **Tripod:** Essential to keep your camera steady during long exposures.\n   - **Remote Shutter Release:** Helps avoid camera shake when taking photos.\n\n2. **Find a Dark Sky Location:**\n   - Light pollution from cities and towns can wash out the night sky. Try to find a location away from urban areas where the night sky is darker and clearer.\n\n3. **Plan Your Shoot:**\n   - Use apps like Stellarium or Planets to plan which constellations or galaxies will be visible at your chosen location and time.\n   - Check the weather forecast to ensure clear skies on the day of your shoot.\n\n4. **Set Up Your Camera:**\n   - Mount your camera on a sturdy tripod.\n   - Set your camera to manual mode and adjust the following settings:\n     - **ISO:** Start with a high ISO (800-6400) depending on how much light there is and how bright the stars are.\n     - **Aperture:** Open up your aperture as much as possible (low f-number) to let in more light, but be aware that too low an f-number may cause stars to appear slightly blurry due to atmospheric conditions.\n     - **Shutter Speed:** The 500 rule is a good starting point to prevent star trails. Divide 500 by the focal length of your lens to get the maximum shutter speed in seconds without noticeable trailing. For example, with a 24mm lens, your shutter speed should not exceed about 21 seconds.\n     - **White Balance:** Adjust to a setting appropriate for the night sky, such as tungsten or fluorescent, or use auto white balance and fine-tune later.\n\n5. **Focus on Infinity:**\n   - Autofocus might not work well in low-light conditions. Focus manually by turning the focus ring to infinity (\u221e), or use live view and zoom in on a bright star to manually focus.\n\n6. **Take Test Shots:**\n   - Take a few test shots to see if your settings are working. Review the images on your camera's LCD screen and make adjustments as necessary.\n\n7. **Shoot in RAW Format:**\n   - This gives you more flexibility in post-processing to adjust exposure, color, and contrast.\n\n8. **Be Patient and Experiment:**\n   - Photography is often about trial and error. Don't be afraid to experiment with different settings and compositions.\n\n9. **Post-Processing:**\n   - After shooting, you can enhance your images using software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop. Adjust exposure, contrast, and color to bring out the details in the stars.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be well on your way to capturing beautiful star photos.

For example, at 24mm, the max shutter speed would be around 20 seconds.\n\n### Techniques\n- **Focus**: Manually focus on infinity (\u221e) or use live view to manually focus on a bright star.\n- **Shoot in RAW**: This format provides better image quality and flexibility in post-processing.\n- **Bracketing**: Take multiple shots at different exposures to ensure you capture the full range of light.\n\n### Conditions\n- **Location**: Find a location away from city lights to minimize light pollution.\n- **Weather**: Clear skies with no moon are best for capturing the most stars.\n- **Time**: Stars are more visible after sunset and before sunrise, especially during the new moon phase.\n\n### Post-Processing\n- **Adjust Exposure**: Balance the exposure so that stars are visible without overexposing them.\n- **Noise Reduction**: Use tools in software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop to reduce noise.\n- **Color Correction**: Adjust colors to enhance the natural hues of the night sky.\n\nBy combining these elements, you'll be well on your way to taking breathtaking star photos.

The outfield is the area beyond the bases.\n\n### Teams\nEach team has nine players on the field at any given time. One team bats while the other pitches and fields.\n\n### Positions\n- Pitcher: Throws the ball towards home plate.\n- Catcher: Stands behind home plate, catches pitches and manages the defense.\n- First Base: Receives throws from the fielders when trying to get runners out.\n- Second Base: A middle infield position.\n- Third Base: Another infield position.\n- Shortstop: Also an infield position, between second and third base.\n- Left Field: An outfield position.\n- Center Field: An outfield position.\n- Right Field: An outfield position.\n\n### Gameplay Overview\n1. **Inning**: The game is divided into innings, typically nine in professional games. Each inning consists of two halves: the top half where the visiting team bats, and the bottom half where the home team bats.\n   \n2. **Pitching**: The pitcher throws the ball towards home plate. The batter tries to hit the ball.\n\n3. **Hitting**: If the batter hits the ball fairly (within the boundaries), they become a baserunner and must run to first base. They can continue running to subsequent bases if they can safely reach them before the defensive team throws the ball to the respective base.\n\n4. **Fielding**: The fielding team tries to catch the ball or throw it to another player who is covering a base to tag the runner out. A runner is tagged out when a defensive player touches them with the ball or the ball reaches the base before the runner does.\n\n5. **Scoring**: A run is scored when a player completes a circuit around all the bases and returns to home plate.\n\n6. **End of Inning**: Once three outs are made, the teams switch roles (the batting team goes to the field, and the fielding team comes to bat).\n\n7. **Winning**: The team with the most runs after the completion of the final inning wins the game.\n\n### Common Rules\n- A strike occurs when the batter swings and misses, fouls off a pitch (except bunts), or does not swing at a pitch that passes through the strike zone.\n- A ball is called if the pitcher throws four pitches outside the strike zone.\n- Three strikes result in a \"strikeout\" for the batter, and the batter is out.\n- Four balls result in a \"walk,\" allowing the batter to advance to first base.\n- Outs can also occur when a fielder catches a fly ball, when a runner is forced out at a base, or when a runner is tagged out.\n\nThis is a simplified explanation of baseball. The rules can vary slightly depending on the league and level of play. Enjoy the game!", "shortest_response": "Baseball is a popular sport played with two teams of nine players each. Here's a basic overview of how to play:\n\n1. **Field Setup**: The game is played on a diamond-shaped field with four bases: first, second, and third base, and home plate. There's also a pitcher's mound in the middle of the infield.\n\n2. **Teams**: Each team takes turns batting and fielding. When a team is batting, they try to score runs by hitting the ball and running around the bases. When they're fielding, they aim to get three outs to end their opponents' turn at bat.\n\n3. **Pitching and Batting**:\n   - A player from the pitching team throws (or pitches) the ball towards home plate.\n   - A batter from the opposing team tries to hit the ball with a bat.\n   \n4. **Running Bases**: If the batter hits the ball into fair territory, they run to first base. They can continue to run to subsequent bases if they feel it's safe or if the ball is hit far enough that they can reach another base before the ball is returned.\n\n5. **Outs**:\n   - A batter is out if they fail to hit the ball into fair territory after three strikes (strikes are called when the ball passes through the strike zone without being hit).\n   - A batter is also out if a fielder catches the ball in the air.\n   - A runner can be tagged out by a fielder with the ball or forced out if a fielder touches a base before the runner reaches it.\n\n6. **Scoring**: A run is scored when a player successfully touches all four bases in order (home plate, first base, second base, third base, and back to home plate).\n\n7. **Innings**: A full game consists of nine innings. In each inning, both teams have one turn to bat and one turn to field. The team with the most runs at the end of the ninth inning wins.\n\n8. **Special Rules**: There are many special rules regarding bunting, stealing bases, and other strategic plays that add complexity to the game.\n\nBaseball requires skill, strategy, and teamwork.

Military space forces were organized under several different Air Force major commands until they were unified when Air Force Space Command was established on 1 September 1982.

Here are some steps and tips to help you achieve this:\n\n1. **Choose Evergreen Plants**: Start by selecting plants that retain their foliage throughout the year. This includes conifers like pine, spruce, and fir trees, as well as broadleaf evergreens such as holly, boxwood, and laurel. Consider the local climate and soil conditions when choosing plants.\n\n2. **Plant Diversity**: Incorporate a variety of evergreens in terms of height, shape, and texture to add interest and depth to your garden. Include ground covers, shrubs, and trees to create layers.\n\n3. **Sunlight Requirements**: Pay attention to the sunlight requirements of each plant. Some evergreens thrive in full sun, while others prefer partial shade. Make sure to place plants in areas where they will receive appropriate light.\n\n4. **Soil Preparation**: Evergreens generally prefer well-drained soil. If your soil is clay-heavy or poorly drained, consider amending it with organic matter like compost or peat moss. Ensure the soil pH is suitable for the plants you choose; most evergreens do well in slightly acidic to neutral soil.\n\n5. **Watering**: While established evergreens are usually quite drought-tolerant, newly planted ones require regular watering until they become established. Once established, they need less frequent watering but still benefit from deep watering during dry spells.\n\n6. **Pruning**: Regular pruning can help maintain the health and shape of your evergreens. Prune after the spring growth flush to encourage dense growth. Be careful not to prune too heavily, especially in late summer or fall, as this can reduce winter hardiness.\n\n7. **Mulching**: Apply a layer of mulch around the base of your evergreens to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. Organic mulches like bark chips or wood shavings are ideal.\n\n8. **Fertilizing**: Evergreens benefit from a slow-release fertilizer applied in early spring. Follow the instructions on the fertilizer package to avoid over-fertilization, which can lead to excessive growth that may be more susceptible to damage.\n\n9. **Pest and Disease Management**: Keep an eye out for common pests and diseases that can affect evergreens, such as spider mites, aphids, and fungal infections. Early detection and treatment are key to maintaining healthy plants.\n\n10. **Winter Protection**: In colder climates, some evergreens may require additional protection against harsh winter conditions. This could include wrapping young trees or using burlap screens to protect from wind and salt spray.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create a beautiful, year-round green oasis in your garden.", "shortest_response": "Creating an evergreen garden involves selecting plants that retain their green color year-round, even in the coldest months.

Some evergreens thrive in warmer climates, while others are more cold-hardy.\n\n3. **Plan Your Garden Layout**: Design your garden with a mix of heights and textures. Use taller evergreens as privacy screens or windbreaks, and shorter varieties for borders or topiaries.\n\n4. **Soil Preparation**: Ensure the soil is well-draining and nutrient-rich. Amend the soil if necessary with compost or other organic matter to improve its quality.\n\n5. **Water Regularly**: Newly planted evergreens need regular watering until they are established.

The second largest cause of natural avalanches is metamorphic changes in the snowpack such as melting due to solar radiation. Other natural causes include rain, earthquakes, rockfall and icefall. Artificial triggers of avalanches include skiers, snowmobiles, and controlled explosive work. Contrary to popular belief, avalanches are not triggered by loud sound; the pressure from sound is orders of magnitude too small to trigger an avalanche.\n\nAvalanche initiation can start at a point with only a small amount of snow moving initially; this is typical of wet snow avalanches or avalanches in dry unconsolidated snow. However, if the snow has sintered into a stiff slab overlying a weak layer then fractures can propagate very rapidly, so that a large volume of snow, that may be thousands of cubic metres, can start moving almost simultaneously.\n\nA snowpack will fail when the load exceeds the strength. The load is straightforward; it is the weight of the snow. However, the strength of the snowpack is much more difficult to determine and is extremely heterogeneous. It varies in detail with properties of the snow grains, size, density, morphology, temperature, water content; and the properties of the bonds between the grains. These properties may all metamorphose in time according to the local humidity, water vapour flux, temperature and heat flux. The top of the snowpack is also extensively influenced by incoming radiation and the local air flow. One of the aims of avalanche research is to develop and validate computer models that can describe the evolution of the seasonal snowpack over time. A complicating factor is the complex interaction of terrain and weather, which causes significant spatial and temporal variability of the depths, crystal forms, and layering of the seasonal snowpack.", "longest_response": "The most common causes of avalanches, listed in descending order of likelihood, are:\n\n1. **Snowfall and Erosion During Storms**: This is the primary cause of avalanches. As new snow accumulates on existing snow layers, it increases the load on the snowpack. If this new layer is unstable or if it erodes an underlying stable layer, it can trigger an avalanche. This process is particularly dangerous during heavy snowfall events where the rate of accumulation outpaces the natural stabilization processes.\n\n2. **Metamorphic Changes in the Snowpack**: Over time, the physical properties of the snow change due to factors like temperature variations, solar radiation, and humidity. These changes can weaken the snowpack, making it more susceptible to failure. For instance, wet snow avalanches often occur when warming temperatures cause the snow to become saturated with water, reducing its cohesion.\n\n3. **Rain**: Rain can quickly add weight to the snowpack and can also cause rapid melting, leading to a loss of cohesion among snow grains. This can destabilize the snowpack, especially if the rain penetrates through a weak layer.\n\n4. **Earthquakes**: Seismic activity can directly cause the displacement of large volumes of snow, triggering avalanches. While less frequent than other causes, the impact can be severe due to the sudden and widespread nature of the disturbance.\n\n5. **Rockfall and Icefall**: Falling rocks or ice chunks can impact the snowpack, causing localized disturbances that can lead to avalanches. These are typically secondary triggers but can be significant in certain mountainous regions.\n\n6. **Artificial Triggers**: Human activities such as skiing, snowmobiling, and controlled explosive work can disturb the snowpack and potentially trigger avalanches, especially in areas where the snowpack is already unstable.\n\nWhile sound is often cited as a potential trigger for avalanches, scientific evidence shows that the pressure from sound waves is far too insignificant to cause an avalanche. The mechanisms described above involve more substantial physical forces and conditions that significantly alter the stability of the snowpack.", "shortest_response": "The most common causes of avalanches, in descending order of likelihood, are:\n\n1. **Natural Snowfall During Storms**: This is the most frequent cause. Avalanches often occur during or just after heavy snowstorms when the new snow adds significant weight to existing snow layers, potentially exceeding the structural integrity of the snowpack.\n\n2. **Metamorphic Changes in the Snowpack**: Natural processes like warming temperatures or solar radiation can cause melting and refreezing within the snowpack, weakening its structure and leading to avalanches, especially in wet snow conditions.\n\n3. **Rain**: Rain can add substantial weight to the snowpack and melt the underlying snow, creating a weaker layer that is more susceptible to failure.\n\n4. **Earthquakes**: Seismic activity can trigger avalanches by shaking the mountain slopes and destabilizing the snowpack.\n\n5. **Rockfall and Icefall**: Falling rocks or chunks of ice can impact the snowpack, causing localized instability and triggering avalanches.\n\n6. **Artificial Triggers**: Human activities such as skiing, snowmobiling, and controlled explosive work can also trigger avalanches, particularly in areas where the snowpack is already unstable.\n\nIt's important to note that while loud sounds do not typically trigger avalanches due to their insufficient pressure, these factors can contribute to overall instability in the snowpack.

Here are several effective methods:\n\n1. **Mechanical Tenderization**: This involves physically breaking down the muscle fibers in the beef. Common techniques include pounding the meat with a mallet on a cutting board or using a meat tenderizer tool. Another method is slicing the meat against the grain (cutting across the muscle fibers), which reduces the length of the muscle fibers and makes them less tough.\n\n2. **Acidic Marination**: Using acidic ingredients like lemon juice, lime juice, vinegar, or buttermilk can help break down proteins in the meat. The acid denatures the proteins, causing them to unwind and become softer. Just be careful not to marinate for too long, as this can make the meat mushy.\n\n3. **Enzymatic Marination**: Pineapple, papaya, kiwi, and ginger contain enzymes that can break down the protein structure of the meat. Papain from papayas and bromelain from pineapples are particularly effective at tenderizing meat.\n\n4. **Salt (Sodium Chloride) Tenderization**: Salting the meat for an extended period can also work wonders. Salt draws moisture out of the meat initially, but then it gets reabsorbed along with the salt, effectively tenderizing the meat. This process is known as osmotic tenderization.\n\n5. **Heat Tenderization**: Cooking the meat slowly over low heat can also help tenderize it. Slow cooking allows the connective tissues in the meat to break down, turning tough cuts into something more palatable. Braising, stewing, and slow roasting are all examples of this technique.\n\n6. **Hydrolysis with Enzymes**: Commercial products containing enzymes such as papain or bromelain can be used to tenderize meat. These products are often sold as marinades or tenderizers and can be very effective.\n\n7. **Using Carbonation**: Some people use carbonated beverages like cola to tenderize meat, though the effectiveness of this method can vary. The acidity in the cola may help tenderize the meat somewhat, but it's generally less reliable than other methods.\n\nEach of these methods can be used alone or in combination with others to achieve the desired level of tenderness. Always consider the type of cut and the intended preparation method when choosing how to tenderize your beef.", "shortest_response": "Tenderizing beef can make it more enjoyable and easier to chew. Here are several effective methods:\n\n1. **Mechanical Tenderization**: This involves physically breaking down the muscle fibers of the meat. Common techniques include pounding the beef with a meat mallet, using a tenderizing hammer, or even slicing the meat against the grain into thin strips.\n\n2. **Marinating**: Many marinades contain acidic ingredients like vinegar, lemon juice, or yogurt that help break down proteins in the meat. Additionally, enzymes from fruits like papaya or pineapple (which contain bromelain) can also be used to tenderize beef. Marinating beef for at least an hour can start to soften the meat, but longer periods (up to 24 hours) can yield better results.\n\n3. **Using Chemical Tenderizers**: There are commercial products available specifically designed to tenderize meat. These often contain enzymes and acids that work similarly to marinating.\n\n4. **Cooking Method**: Choosing the right cooking method can also affect tenderness. Slow-cooking methods such as braising or stewing can break down tough cuts of meat over time, making them much more tender. Conversely, quick-cooking methods like grilling or pan-searing should be done carefully to avoid overcooking, which can lead to toughness.\n\n5. **Resting the Meat**: After cooking, allowing the meat to rest for a few minutes before cutting into it helps redistribute the juices back into the meat, making it juicier and more tender.\n\nEach method has its own benefits, and combining them can often produce the best results depending on the cut of beef and your specific recipe needs.", "input_size": 38, "output_sizes": [459, 334, 430, 410, 375, 355, 357, 430, 379, 492], "output_mean": 402.1, "output_std": 48.06, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 361.5, "p50": 394.5, "p75": 430.0, "p99": 489.03}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "open_qa", "gen_time": 19.202}, {"sample_id": "07e8ff95ef185875", "prompt_id": "8b31b1677804394b", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Given the reference text below, what is Air Jordan?\nContext: Air Jordan is a line of basketball shoes and athletic apparel produced by American corporation Nike, Inc.

Here are some common techniques:\n\n1. **Butt Joint**: This is one of the simplest joints where you simply attach two pieces of wood end-to-end or edge-to-edge with glue and nails or screws. It's not very strong but can work well for less demanding projects.\n\n2. **Dovetail Joint**: This joint is known for its strength and resistance to being pulled apart. It's made by cutting interlocking wedge-shaped tails and pins on adjoining pieces of wood. This is more complex and requires precise cutting.\n\n3. **Mortise and Tenon Joint**: In this joint, one piece of wood (the tenon) fits into a hole (mortise) cut into another piece of wood. This joint is strong and commonly used for furniture legs and frames.\n\n4. **Dowel Joint**: Similar to a butt joint but reinforced with dowels. Holes are drilled through both pieces of wood, and dowels are inserted and glued to provide additional strength.\n\n5. **Pocket Screws**: This method involves driving screws into pre-drilled holes from the underside of one board into the other. The screw heads sit below the surface of the wood, often requiring a pocket hole jig for accurate drilling.\n\n6. **Biscuit Joint**: A biscuit joint uses thin, football-shaped pieces of wood (biscuits) that fit into slots cut in the edges of two boards. When glued, they help align the boards and add strength.\n\n7. **Lap Joint**: In this joint, part of one board overlaps the other. Both edge-to-edge lap joints and end-to-end lap joints exist. They can be glued or fastened with nails or screws.\n\n8. **Rabbet Joint**: This joint involves cutting a groove along the edge of one piece of wood so that the other piece can fit into it. It\u2019s useful for attaching sides to a cabinet back or drawer bottom.\n\n### Tools Needed:\n- Saw (hand saw, circular saw, or table saw)\n- Drill\n- Chisels\n- Router (for some joints like dovetails or rabbets)\n- Clamps\n- Glue\n- Sandpaper\n\n### Steps for Joining Wood:\n1. **Prepare the Pieces**: Ensure the wood is cut to the correct size and shape. Sand any rough edges.\n2. **Mark the Joints**: If necessary, mark the locations for cuts or holes.\n3. **Cut the Joints**: Use appropriate tools to cut the joints accurately.\n4. **Assemble**: Apply wood glue to the surfaces to be joined. Align the pieces and secure them with clamps or fasteners as needed.\n5. **Allow Drying Time**: Give the glue sufficient time to dry completely.\n6. **Clean Up and Finishing**: Remove clamps and clean up excess glue. Finish the piece according to your design needs.\n\nEach joint has its own advantages and is suitable for different types of projects.

Here are some common methods:\n\n1. **Dowels**: Doweling involves drilling holes into both pieces of wood and inserting dowel rods to connect them. This method provides a strong joint and is relatively easy to execute.\n\n2. **Screws and Bolts**: Screws and bolts are straightforward and effective for joining wood. They provide a secure connection but may not look as aesthetically pleasing if exposed. Use wood screws or carriage bolts with washers for best results.\n\n3. **Nails and Brads**: Nails and brads (small nails) can be used for temporary or decorative joints. Brad nails are often used in modern furniture construction for their minimal visibility and quick application.\n\n4. **Glue**: Wood glue is an excellent adhesive that can create a strong bond between pieces of wood. It's particularly useful when combined with other mechanical fasteners like dowels or biscuits.\n\n5. **Biscuit Joinery**: Biscuit joinery uses oval-shaped wooden biscuits that fit into slots cut into the edges of the wood pieces. This method is great for edge-to-edge joints and can enhance the structural integrity and aesthetics of your project.\n\n6. **Mortise and Tenon Joints**: These are traditional joints where one piece of wood has a square hole (mortise) and another piece has a corresponding projection (tenon). This method requires more skill and tools but offers a very strong and attractive joint.\n\n7. **Dado and Rabbet Joints**: A dado joint involves cutting a slot across the grain of one board, while a rabbet joint cuts along the edge of a board. These joints are useful for joining sides to shelves or backs to cabinets.\n\n8. **Butt Joints**: These are simple joints where two pieces of wood are joined at right angles by being butted together and secured with screws, nails, or glue. While they are easy to make, they are not as strong as some other types of joints unless reinforced.\n\nEach of these methods has its own advantages and is suitable for different applications.

For example, Joey leaves the contents of his bank account \"to my employees.\" If Joey then fires some of old employees and hires new ones, the new employees will inherit the contents of the bank account under this provision.\n    The testator devises a general type of property, and then changes the specific items of property within that category.

Joey drives a 1974 AMC Gremlin at the time of the testamentary instrument, but later sells the Gremlin and purchases a 2016 Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coup\u00e9 with suicide doors and teak paneling.

Over the next few years, Joey continues to teach and regularly enrolls new students while also retiring some older ones. Under the doctrine of acts of independent significance, Joey's actions of enrolling and retiring students are considered acts of independent significance because they reflect his ongoing involvement in teaching and do not appear to be made solely to alter the disposition of his property as per his will. Therefore, the collection of rare books would be left to the students he currently teaches at the time of his death.\n\n2. **Changing Specific Items Within a General Category of Property**: In another scenario, Joey's will stipulates, \"I leave my residence to my sister, Mary.\" Initially, Joey owns a modest house in the suburbs. However, several years later, due to a significant inheritance, Joey decides to sell the house and purchase a luxurious villa on the coast.

Therefore, the adopted child would also be entitled to a share of the house upon Joey's passing.\n\n2. **Change in Specific Property Within a Category**: In Joey's will, he specifies, \"I leave my collection of rare books to Ethan.\" Initially, Joey owns a collection of rare first editions. Over time, Joey decides to sell these first editions and instead acquires a collection of rare signed manuscripts.

For example, in Western culture, the snake is often associated with deceit and temptation, as seen in the biblical story of Adam and Eve.\n\n3. **Direct Experiences**: Negative personal experiences with snakes, even if they were non-venomous or harmless, can lead to a fear of all snakes. Such experiences might include being bitten, seeing someone else get hurt, or simply having a close encounter that was frightening.\n\n4. **Media Representation**: Movies, television shows, and video games often depict snakes as dangerous creatures, which can reinforce fears and misconceptions about these animals. This portrayal can make snakes seem more threatening than they actually are in reality.\n\n5. **Generalization**: Humans have a tendency to generalize when it comes to perceived threats. If one encounters a venomous snake, this experience might lead to a generalized fear of all snakes, regardless of their actual danger level.\n\nUnderstanding and education about snakes can help mitigate such fears, as many species are not harmful to humans and play important roles in ecosystems.

There are numerous types of sorting algorithms, each with its own characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. Here are some common ones:\n\n1. **Bubble Sort**: This is one of the simplest comparison-based sorting algorithms. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\n2. **Selection Sort**: This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. It maintains two subarrays in a given array: the subarray which is already sorted and the remaining subarray which is unsorted.\n\n3. **Insertion Sort**: Similar to how you might sort a hand of playing cards, insertion sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.\n\n4. **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge operation is the key process that assumes that the two halves are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one.\n\n5. **Quick Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm, quicksort works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.\n\n6. **Heap Sort**: Based on a comparison of elements, this algorithm uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements. It can be seen as an improved selection sort: like that algorithm, it divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region.\n\n7. **Radix Sort**: Unlike comparison-based sorting algorithms, radix sort is not comparison-based. It sorts integers by processing individual digits. Because integers can represent strings of characters (e.g., names or dates) and specially formatted floating point numbers, radix sort is not limited to integers.\n\n8. **Bucket Sort**: This algorithm works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm.\n\n9. **Counting Sort**: This algorithm is efficient if the range of input data (k) is not significantly greater than the number of objects to be sorted. It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value, and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence.\n\nEach of these algorithms has different performance characteristics based on their best, average, and worst-case scenarios.

The process is recursively applied to the sub-arrays.\n\n6. **Heap Sort**: This algorithm uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements. It first builds a heap from the input data, then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and rebuilds the heap until all elements are sorted.\n\n7. **Radix Sort**: A non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping the keys by individual digits which share the same significant position and value.\n\n8. **Bucket Sort**: Works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sort algorithm.\n\n9. **Counting Sort**: An efficient algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers; that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm.

It contrasts with relative addressing (which uses offsets from a base address), indirect addressing (where the address itself is stored in another memory location), and indexed addressing (where an index is added to a base address).\n\n5. **Performance**: Directly using absolute addresses can improve performance because it eliminates the need for additional calculations to determine the actual memory location.\n\nUnderstanding absolute addresses is crucial for low-level programming and system development, where precise control over memory usage is necessary.", "shortest_response": "An absolute address in memory refers to a specific location in computer memory that is identified by a unique numerical value or label.

Their large, showy flowers are an adaptation for attracting pollinators.\n\n2. **Water Lilies**: Water lilies can be either wind-pollinated or insect-pollinated, depending on the species. Some species produce flowers that float on the water surface and may attract insects like beetles and flies, while others have flowers that remain submerged and are thought to be wind-pollinated. However, many aquatic plants are adapted for wind pollination due to their open water habitat.\n\n3. **Vallisneria** (Eelgrass): This plant is primarily wind-pollinated (anemophilous). It produces long, feathery flower stalks that release pollen into the water, which can then be carried by water currents or wind-like movements in the water to reach other plants.\n\n4. **Zostera** (Eelgrass): Like Vallisneria, Zostera is also wind-pollinated. Its flowers are very small and lack bright colors or scents typical of animal-pollinated flowers. Pollen is released into the water and can be dispersed by water currents, making it a prime example of aquatic wind pollination.\n\nIn summary:\n- **Magnolias**: Insect-pollinated (entomophilous)\n- **Water Lilies**: Can be insect-pollinated or wind-pollinated, but often considered wind-pollinated for aquatic species.\n- **Vallisneria**: Wind-pollinated (anemophilous)\n- **Zostera**: Wind-pollinated (anemophilous)", "shortest_response": "Certainly!

Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain this absence, ranging from the idea that advanced civilizations might be rare or short-lived, to the notion that they choose not to communicate with us. Here are some of the most prominent solutions:\n\n1. **Rare Earth Hypothesis**: This suggests that conditions suitable for life, particularly intelligent life, are exceptionally rare in the universe. The hypothesis argues that the specific combination of factors necessary for complex life to evolve on Earth (such as the presence of a large moon, a stable star, and a position within the habitable zone) may be unique.\n\n2. **The Great Filter**: This theory posits that there is some significant barrier or challenge that prevents civilizations from reaching the stage where they can expand into space or become detectable to us. If this filter is common in the development of intelligent life, it could explain why we do not see evidence of other civilizations. The filter could occur at various stages, from the emergence of life itself to the point of becoming a space-faring civilization.\n\n3. **Self-Destruction**: Another possibility is that technological civilizations tend to destroy themselves before they reach the point of becoming detectable to us. This could happen through warfare, environmental collapse, or some other form of self-destruction.\n\n4. **Technological Singularity**: Some suggest that once a civilization reaches a certain level of technological advancement, it may undergo a rapid transformation that makes it unrecognizable or undetectable to us. For example, advanced civilizations might develop technologies that allow them to exist in forms we cannot detect, such as virtual realities or advanced forms of communication that are beyond our current understanding.\n\n5. **Non-Interference Principle**: It\u2019s possible that other civilizations have chosen not to communicate with or interfere with younger civilizations like ours, adhering to a kind of cosmic protocol designed to protect the development of less advanced species.\n\n6. **Communication Technology Limitations**: Advanced civilizations might use forms of communication or technology that we haven't yet developed or recognized. This could include highly advanced forms of encryption, quantum communication, or even methods of signaling that are beyond our current technological capabilities.\n\n7. **Temporal Separation**: Civilizations might be separated by time rather than space. Given the age of the universe, it's possible that civilizations capable of communicating across interstellar distances have arisen and disappeared long before we had the technology to detect them.\n\n8. **Dormant or Hidden Civilizations**: There's also the possibility that civilizations capable of communicating with us have chosen to remain dormant or hidden, perhaps due to a desire for isolation or because they have found more interesting things to explore within their own universe.\n\nEach of these explanations has its merits and challenges, and the true resolution to Fermi's Paradox likely involves a combination of several factors.

Many theories attempt to address this paradox, and while there isn't a single consensus, several solutions are widely discussed:\n\n1. **Rare Earth Hypothesis**: This suggests that the emergence of intelligent life is extremely rare due to a long series of highly improbable events that led to human civilization on Earth. This could mean that the conditions necessary for complex life are so specific that they rarely occur.\n\n2. **The Great Filter**: This hypothesis proposes that at some point in the development of a civilization, there is a significant barrier (or filter) that prevents it from becoming detectable or spreading beyond its home planet. If the filter occurs early in the process, then we might see many young civilizations but none that have survived long enough to become advanced. If it happens later, we might be seeing the effects of civilizations that have passed the early stages but failed to overcome a later challenge.\n\n3. **Self-Destruction**: Another possibility is that civilizations tend to destroy themselves before they can spread to other star systems, perhaps through war, environmental collapse, or technological accidents.\n\n4. **They Are Here But We Don\u2019t Recognize Them**: This idea suggests that alien civilizations exist but are intentionally avoiding contact with us, possibly because they're observing us from a distance (as in the \"Zoo Hypothesis\") or because they communicate in ways we cannot yet understand.\n\n5. **Technological Singularity**: Advanced civilizations may have reached a point where their technology has progressed to such an extent that they no longer need to expand physically or make their presence known to others, or they might have transcended physical existence altogether.\n\n6. **Temporal Separation**: The time scales involved in interstellar travel might be so vast that civilizations rise and fall without ever encountering each other.\n\nEach of these hypotheses offers a different perspective on why we haven't found evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, and scientists continue to explore new ideas as our understanding of the universe and our technology evolve.", "input_size": 40, "output_sizes": [446, 469, 425, 490, 459, 492, 521, 530, 620, 542], "output_mean": 499.4, "output_std": 53.71, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 461.5, "p50": 491.0, "p75": 527.75, "p99": 612.98}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "creative_writing", "gen_time": 25.08789}, {"sample_id": "369046b3d0553e10", "prompt_id": "793ac11c1851f1dd", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Identify which animal is domesticated or wild: Dog, Asian Elephant", "longest_response": "The dog (Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated animal, while the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) can be found in both wild and semi-domesticated conditions.

In the first place, the romantics, particularly Victor Hugo. Later on, and in a decisive fashion, Dar\u00edo was influenced by the parnassians: Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, Catulle Mend\u00e8s, and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Heredia. Another decisive influence was the writer of prose and poetry and national hero of Cuba, Jose Mart\u00ed. The final defining element of Darianian aesthetic is his admiration towards the symbolists, especially Paul Verlaine. Recapitulating his own poetic trajectory in the initial poem of Cantos de vida y esperanza (1905) Dar\u00edo himself synthesized his main influences when he affirms that he was \"strong with Hugo and ambiguous with Verlaine\" (\"con Hugo fuerte y con Verlaine ambiguo\".)\n\nIn the section \"Palabras Liminares\" of Prosas Profanas (1896) he had already written a paragraph that reveals the importance of French culture in the development of his literary work:\n\nThe old Spaniard with a white beard points towards a series of illustrious portraits: \"This one\u2014he says\u2014is the great Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, one-handed genius; this one is Lope de Vega, this one is Garcilaso, this one Quintana.\" I ask him for the noble man Graci\u00e1n, for Teresa of \u00c1vila, for the brave G\u00f3ngora and the strongest of all, Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas. Then I say: \"Shakespeare! Dante! Hugo...! (and in my head: Verlaine...!)\"\nThen, when saying goodbye: \"-Old man, it is important to say: my wife is from my land; my mistress is from Paris.\"\n\nLos raros is an illustrative volume regarding literary tastes, which he published on the same year as Prosas profanas, and dedicated to briefly glossing some of the writers and intellectuals towards whom he felt profound admiration. Amongst those in the book we find Edgar Allan Poe, Villiers de l'Isle Adam, L\u00e9on Bloy, Paul Verlaine, Lautr\u00e9amont, Eug\u00e9nio de Castro and Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed (the latter being the only one mentioned who wrote their literary work in Spanish.) The predominance of French culture is more than evident. Dar\u00edo wrote: \"Modernism is nothing more than Spanish verse and prose passed through the fine sieve of the good French verse and the good French prose.\" Setting aside his initial stage, before Azul..., in which his poetry owes a great deal to the great names of 19th-century Spanish poetry, such as N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Arce and Campoamor, Dar\u00edo was a great admirer of B\u00e9cquer. Spanish themes are well represented in his work, already in Prosas profanas and, specially, after his second trip to Spain, in 1899. Conscious of contemporaneous Spanish decadence in politics and the arts (a preoccupation he shared with the so-called Generation of '98), he frequently was inspired by characters and elements of the past. Regarding authors in other languages, it is worth mentioning that he felt a profound admiration towards three writers from the United States: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Edgar Allan Poe and Walt Whitman.[citation needed]", "longest_response": "Based on the provided context, here are the names of the key influencers on Ruben Dario's poetry:\n\n1. **Victor Hugo** - Influenced Dario during his early romantic phase.\n2. **Th\u00e9ophile Gautier** - One of the Parnassian poets who significantly impacted Dario.\n3. **Catulle Mend\u00e8s** - Another Parnassian poet admired by Dario.\n4. **Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Heredia** - Also a notable Parnassian poet influencing Dario.\n5. **Paul Verlaine** - A symbolist poet whose style greatly influenced Dario's later works.\n6. **Jose Mart\u00ed** - A Cuban writer and national hero who played a decisive role in shaping Dario's literary path.\n7. **Edgar Allan Poe** - An American author whose work Dario admired.\n8. **Ralph Waldo Emerson** - An influential American writer Dario held in high regard.\n9. **Walt Whitman** - Another significant American poet admired by Dario.\n\nAdditionally, while not explicitly categorized under the same influence as the French poets but still notable for their impact, Dario also looked up to:\n- **Miguel de Cervantes**, **Lope de Vega**, **Garcilaso**, **Quintana**, **Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas**, and **B\u00e9cquer** (Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer) among others from Spanish literature.", "shortest_response": "Based on the provided context, here are the names of the key influencers on Ruben Dario's poetry:\n\n1.

The fibers at the fabric surface are squashed and frayed, and this condition hardens while drying the laundry in air, giving the laundry a harsh feel. Adding a liquid fabric softener to the final rinse (rinse-cycle softener) results in laundry that feels softer.", "longest_response": "Using fabric softener can significantly improve the comfort and appearance of your laundry for several reasons:\n\n1. **Softening Effect**: As you mentioned, machine washing can cause fibers to become compressed and frayed, leading to a rough texture. Fabric softeners contain chemicals like quaternary ammonium compounds that coat the fibers of fabrics, making them smoother and less prone to static cling, thus resulting in a softer feel.\n\n2. **Reducing Static Cling**: One of the primary benefits of fabric softener is its ability to reduce static electricity in clothes. This not only makes the clothes more comfortable to wear but also prevents them from sticking together or clinging to your body, which can be particularly noticeable with synthetic fabrics.\n\n3. **Enhanced Comfort**: Softened clothes are generally more pleasant to wear against the skin, especially for sensitive individuals. They can also make sheets and towels more comfortable and cozy.\n\n4. **Extended Life of Fabrics**: By reducing the friction between fibers, fabric softeners can help extend the life of your textiles. Less friction means less wear and tear over time, potentially saving you money in the long run by extending the lifespan of your clothing and household linens.\n\n5. **Improved Appearance**: While it might seem subtle, softened fabrics can appear more vibrant and clean.

This cycle can include methods like GET (to retrieve information), POST (to submit data to be processed to a specified resource), PUT (to send data to be stored as a specific resource), DELETE (to delete the specified resource), among others.\n\n3. **Stateless Protocol**: HTTP is stateless, meaning that the server does not store any data or context about the client between individual requests.

News coverage tends to focus more on these events, reinforcing the idea that sharks are a significant danger to humans.\n\n3. **Natural Instincts**: Sharks are apex predators in their environment, and humans may have an innate fear response to large predators. This could be part of an evolutionary survival mechanism that helps humans avoid dangerous situations.\n\n4. **Misunderstanding**: There is often a lack of understanding about shark behavior and biology. Many people don't realize that sharks generally do not target humans as prey. Most shark encounters with humans are cases of mistaken identity or curiosity rather than predatory intent.\n\n5. **Cultural Factors**: In certain cultures, sharks are associated with myths and legends that often depict them as evil or menacing creatures. These cultural narratives can contribute to a general fear or mistrust of sharks.\n\nIt's important to note that while fear of sharks is common, it's based more on perception than reality.

This leads to an overestimation of the risk posed by sharks.\n\n4. **Instinctive Fear**: Like many fears, there may also be an instinctual element to being afraid of sharks, especially if one has had a negative experience or knows someone who has been affected by a shark encounter.\n\nIt's important to note that while it is natural to feel some level of fear towards sharks, statistically, humans are much more likely to face danger from other sources than from sharks.

It often includes a mixture of some genuine scientific facts with exaggerated, unfounded, or outright false information. Pseudoscientific ideas can be difficult to distinguish from genuine science due to their superficial resemblance and the way they may appeal to common beliefs or emotions.\n\nThe demarcation between science and pseudoscience is crucial because it impacts various fields including healthcare, policy-making, and public understanding of science. Here are some key aspects of pseudoscience:\n\n1. **Lack of Empirical Evidence**: True scientific theories are supported by empirical evidence obtained through experiments and observations. Pseudoscientific claims, on the other hand, are often not testable or falsifiable, meaning they cannot be disproven by evidence.\n\n2. **Resistance to Refutation**: When faced with contradictory evidence, proponents of pseudoscience may modify their claims in ways that make them impossible to disprove, rather than revising or abandoning them based on new evidence.\n\n3. **Absence of Peer Review**: Scientific research undergoes rigorous peer review before publication to ensure accuracy and reliability. Pseudoscientific claims often bypass this process or are published in non-peer-reviewed journals or self-published works.\n\n4. **Appeal to Authority**: Pseudoscience often relies heavily on testimonials or appeals to authority figures who may not have expertise in the relevant field. Genuine science emphasizes the quality and relevance of the evidence itself over the credentials of those presenting it.\n\n5. **Misuse of Scientific Terminology**: Pseudoscientists might use technical jargon and complex language to give their claims an appearance of scientific legitimacy, even when the underlying concepts are flawed or unrelated to actual scientific principles.\n\n6. **Philosophical and Political Implications**: The distinction between science and pseudoscience is not just academic; it has significant societal impacts. For example, accepting pseudoscientific health claims can lead to harmful medical practices, while adopting pseudoscientific environmental policies can result in ineffective or counterproductive actions.\n\nAddressing pseudoscience is essential for promoting scientific literacy and critical thinking skills. Educators play a vital role in helping students understand how to evaluate scientific claims critically and recognize the characteristics of pseudoscience.

Scientific theories are characterized by their ability to make testable predictions, their falsifiability, and their openness to peer review and replication. In contrast, pseudoscientific claims often lack these characteristics and can sometimes be maintained despite contradictory evidence.\n\nExamples of pseudoscientific beliefs include creationism, astrology, homeopathy, and certain aspects of alternative medicine.

It is used for tool handles, pickaxe handles, bows, wheel spokes, carts, drumsticks, lacrosse stick handles, golf club shafts (sometimes still called hickory stick, even though made of steel or graphite), the bottoms of skis, walking sticks, and for punitive use as a switch (like hazel), and especially as a cane-like hickory stick in schools and use by parents. Paddles are often made from hickory. This property of hickory wood has left a trace in some Native American languages: in Ojibwe, hickory is called mitigwaabaak, a compound of mitigwaab \"bow\" and the final -aakw \"hardwood tree\".

Here\u2019s a breakdown to help you make an informed decision:\n\n1. **Weight Consideration**: Touring bindings are typically lighter than alpine bindings because they need to be carried uphill as well as downhill. Look for bindings that offer a good balance between weight and safety.\n\n2. **Type of Binding**:\n   - **Tech Bindings (Skin Baskets)**: These bindings are designed to allow for easy skinning (walking) up hills and quick transitions between climbing and descending. They usually feature heel pieces that can be detached for walking and re-attached for skiing. Examples include the Dynafit TLT Radical 3, G3 Ion, and Marker Kingpin.\n   - **AT (Alpine Touring) Bindings**: These bindings offer a more traditional step-in system but still allow for touring. They are generally heavier than tech bindings but provide more stability and control. Examples include the Black Diamond Helio and Voile Ultralight AT.\n\n3. **Release Values and Settings**: The release values should match your skier profile based on your weight and ability level. Typically, touring bindings have lower DIN settings compared to alpine bindings due to the nature of the terrain and the need for flexibility during skinning.\n\n4. **Compatibility with Boots**: Ensure that the bindings you choose are compatible with your boots. Tech bindings require specific boot soles (such as those from Dynafit or Salomon), while AT bindings work with standard alpine boot soles.\n\n5. **Ski Length and Width**: Consider the length and width of your skis when choosing bindings. Broader skis may require wider bindings for better performance and safety.\n\n6. **Brand Reputation and Reviews**: Research different brands and read reviews from other touring enthusiasts to get an idea of the reliability and performance of various models.\n\n7. **Budget**: While it\u2019s tempting to go for the most expensive option, consider what features are most important to you and whether the added cost is justified.\n\nUltimately, the best setup will depend on your specific needs and preferences.

This is crucial as you'll be carrying your skis while hiking up the mountain.\n\n2. **Heel Lift**: Touring bindings often feature a heel lift mechanism that allows the heel to rise when climbing, making it easier to ascend slopes. When descending, the heel locks down to provide better control and stability.\n\n3. **Release Mechanism**: Look for bindings with adjustable release settings to ensure safety. These should comply with ISO standards (ISO 9462) or similar international safety standards.\n\n4. **Compatibility**: Ensure that the bindings are compatible with your boots. Most touring bindings use a tech plate system at the toe, which requires specific boots designed for this type of binding.\n\n5. **Durability and Reliability**: Choose bindings made from high-quality materials that can withstand the rigors of both climbing and skiing. Durability is key since touring involves more wear and tear compared to downhill skiing alone.\n\nPopular touring bindings include models from brands like Dynafit, G3, Black Diamond, and Scarpa, each offering different features and price points.

That same year, Prime Minister George Grenville proposed direct taxes on the colonies to raise revenue, but he delayed action to see whether the colonies would propose some way to raise the revenue themselves.\n\nGrenville had asserted in 1762 that the whole revenue of the custom houses in America amounted to one or two thousand pounds sterling a year, and that the English exchequer was paying between seven and eight thousand pounds a year to collect. Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations that Parliament \"has never hitherto demanded of [the American colonies] anything which even approached to a just proportion to what was paid by their fellow subjects at home.\" Benjamin Franklin would later testify in Parliament in 1766 to the contrary, reporting that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He argued that local colonial governments had raised, outfitted, and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France in just the French and Indian War alone\u2014as many as Britain itself sent\u2014and spent many millions from American treasuries doing so.\n\nParliament finally passed the Stamp Act in March 1765, which imposed direct taxes on the colonies for the first time. All official documents, newspapers, almanacs, and pamphlets were required to have the stamps\u2014even decks of playing cards. The colonists did not object that the taxes were high; they were actually low. They objected to their lack of representation in the Parliament, which gave them no voice concerning legislation that affected them. The British were, however, reacting to an entirely different issue: at the conclusion of the recent war the Crown had to deal with approximately 1,500 politically well-connected British Army officers. The decision was made to keep them on active duty with full pay, but they\u2014and their commands\u2014also had to be stationed somewhere. Stationing a standing army in Great Britain during peacetime was politically unacceptable, so they determined to station them in America and have the Americans pay them through the new tax. The soldiers had no military mission however; they were not there to defend the colonies because there was no current threat to the colonies.\n\nThe Sons of Liberty formed shortly after the Act in 1765, and they used public demonstrations, boycotts, and threats of violence to ensure that the British tax laws were unenforceable. In Boston, the Sons of Liberty burned the records of the vice admiralty court and looted the home of chief justice Thomas Hutchinson. Several legislatures called for united action, and nine colonies sent delegates to the Stamp Act Congress in New York City in October. Moderates led by John Dickinson drew up a Declaration of Rights and Grievances stating that taxes passed without representation violated their rights as Englishmen, and colonists emphasized their determination by boycotting imports of British merchandise.\n\nThe Parliament at Westminster saw itself as the supreme lawmaking authority throughout the Empire and thus entitled to levy any tax without colonial approval or even consultation. They argued that the colonies were legally British corporations subordinate to the British Parliament, and they pointed to numerous instances where Parliament had made laws in the past that were binding on the colonies. Parliament insisted that the colonists effectively enjoyed a \"virtual representation\", as most British people did, since only a small minority of the British population elected representatives to Parliament. However, Americans such as James Otis maintained that there was no one in Parliament responsible specifically for any colonial constituency, so they were not \"virtually represented\" by anyone in Parliament at all.\n\nThe Rockingham government came to power in July 1765, and Parliament debated whether to repeal the stamp tax or to send an army to enforce it. Benjamin Franklin made the case for repeal, explaining that the colonies had spent heavily in manpower, money, and blood defending the empire in a series of wars against the French and indigenous people, and that further taxes to pay for those wars were unjust and might bring about a rebellion. Parliament agreed and repealed the tax on February 21, 1766, but they insisted in the Declaratory Act of March 1766 that they retained full power to make laws for the colonies \"in all cases whatsoever\". The repeal nonetheless caused widespread celebrations in the colonies.\n\n1767\u20131773: Townshend Acts and the Tea Act\nMain articles: Townshend Acts and Tea Act\nFurther information: Crisis of 1772, Massachusetts Circular Letter, Boston Massacre, and Boston Tea Party\n\nLetter III of John Dickinson's Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, published in the Pennsylvania Chronicle, December 1767\nIn 1767, the Parliament passed the Townshend Acts which placed duties on a number of staple goods, including paper, glass, and tea, and established a Board of Customs in Boston to more rigorously execute trade regulations. The new taxes were enacted on the belief that Americans only objected to internal taxes and not to external taxes such as custom duties. However, in his widely read pamphlet, Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, John Dickinson argued against the constitutionality of the acts because their purpose was to raise revenue and not to regulate trade. Colonists responded to the taxes by organizing new boycotts of British goods. These boycotts were less effective, however, as the goods taxed by the Townshend Acts were widely used.\n\nIn February 1768, the Assembly of Massachusetts Bay issued a circular letter to the other colonies urging them to coordinate resistance. The governor dissolved the assembly when it refused to rescind the letter. Meanwhile, a riot broke out in Boston in June 1768 over the seizure of the sloop Liberty, owned by John Hancock, for alleged smuggling. Customs officials were forced to flee, prompting the British to deploy troops to Boston. A Boston town meeting declared that no obedience was due to parliamentary laws and called for the convening of a convention. A convention assembled but only issued a mild protest before dissolving itself. In January 1769, Parliament responded to the unrest by reactivating the Treason Act 1543 which called for subjects outside the realm to face trials for treason in England. The governor of Massachusetts was instructed to collect evidence of said treason, and the threat caused widespread outrage, though it was not carried out.\n\nOn March 5, 1770, a large crowd gathered around a group of British soldiers on a Boston street. The crowd grew threatening, throwing snowballs, rocks, and debris at them. One soldier was clubbed and fell. There was no order to fire, but the soldiers panicked and fired into the crowd. They hit 11 people; three civilians died of wounds at the scene of the shooting, and two died shortly after the incident. The event quickly came to be called the Boston Massacre. The soldiers were tried and acquitted (defended by John Adams), but the widespread descriptions soon began to turn colonial sentiment against the British. This accelerated the downward spiral in the relationship between Britain and the Province of Massachusetts.\n\nA new ministry under Lord North came to power in 1770, and Parliament withdrew all taxes except the tax on tea, giving up its efforts to raise revenue while maintaining the right to tax. This temporarily resolved the crisis, and the boycott of British goods largely ceased, with only the more radical patriots such as Samuel Adams continuing to agitate.[citation needed]\n\n\nOn June 9, 1772, the Sons of Liberty burned HMS Gaspee, a British customs schooner in Narragansett Bay.\nIn June 1772, American patriots, including John Brown, burned a British warship that had been vigorously enforcing unpopular trade regulations, in what became known as the Gaspee Affair. The affair was investigated for possible treason, but no action was taken.\n\nIn 1772, it became known that the Crown intended to pay fixed salaries to the governors and judges in Massachusetts, which had been paid by local authorities. This would reduce the influence of colonial representatives over their government. Samuel Adams in Boston set about creating new Committees of Correspondence, which linked Patriots in all 13 colonies and eventually provided the framework for a rebel government. Virginia, the largest colony, set up its Committee of Correspondence in early 1773, on which Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson served.\n\nA total of about 7,000 to 8,000 Patriots served on Committees of Correspondence at the colonial and local levels, comprising most of the leadership in their communities. Loyalists were excluded. The committees became the leaders of the American resistance to British actions, and later largely determined the war effort at the state and local level. When the First Continental Congress decided to boycott British products, the colonial and local Committees took charge, examining merchant records and publishing the names of merchants who attempted to defy the boycott by importing British goods.\n\nIn 1773, private letters were published in which Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson claimed that the colonists could not enjoy all English liberties, and in which Lieutenant Governor Andrew Oliver called for the direct payment of colonial officials. The letters' contents were used as evidence of a systematic plot against American rights, and discredited Hutchinson in the eyes of the people; the colonial Assembly petitioned for his recall. Benjamin Franklin, postmaster general for the colonies, acknowledged that he leaked the letters, which led to him being berated by British officials and removed from his position.\n\n\nThe December 16, 1773 Boston Tea Party, led by Samuel Adams and Sons of Liberty, has become a mainstay of American patriotic lore.\nMeanwhile, Parliament passed the Tea Act lowering the price of taxed tea exported to the colonies, to help the British East India Company undersell smuggled untaxed Dutch tea. Special consignees were appointed to sell the tea to bypass colonial merchants. The act was opposed by those who resisted the taxes and also by smugglers who stood to lose business.[citation needed] In most instances, the consignees were forced by the Americans to resign and the tea was turned back, but Massachusetts governor Hutchinson refused to allow Boston merchants to give in to pressure. A town meeting in Boston determined that the tea would not be landed, and ignored a demand from the governor to disperse. On December 16, 1773, a group of men, led by Samuel Adams and dressed to evoke the appearance of indigenous people, boarded the ships of the East India Company and dumped \u00a310,000 worth of tea from their holds (approximately \u00a3636,000 in 2008) into Boston Harbor. Decades later, this event became known as the Boston Tea Party and remains a significant part of American patriotic lore.\n\n1774\u20131775: Intolerable Acts\nMain article: Intolerable Acts\nFurther information: Quebec Act and Continental Association\n\nA 1774 etching from The London Magazine depicts Prime Minister Lord North, author of the Boston Port Act, forcing the Intolerable Acts down the throat of America, whose arms are restrained by Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, and a tattered \"Boston Petition\" lays trampled on the ground beside her. Lord Sandwich pins down her feet and peers up her robes; behind them, Mother Britannia weeps while France and Spain look on.\nThe British government responded by passing several measures that came to be known as the Intolerable Acts, further darkening colonial opinion towards England. They consisted of four laws enacted by the British parliament. The first was the Massachusetts Government Act which altered the Massachusetts charter and restricted town meetings. The second act was the Administration of Justice", "longest_response": "Based on the passage provided, the key taxes and acts that led to the American Revolution include:\n\n1. **Sugar Act (1764)** - Decreased customs duties on sugar and molasses but enforced them more strictly. It aimed to generate revenue and enforce trade laws more rigorously.\n\n2. **Stamp Act (1765)** - Imposed direct taxes on the colonies for the first time, requiring all official documents, newspapers, almanacs, and even playing cards to be printed on stamped paper produced in London. This act was particularly controversial as it represented a form of direct taxation that the colonists felt they should not have to pay given their lack of representation in the British Parliament.\n\n3. **Declaratory Act (1766)** - Passed alongside the repeal of the Stamp Act, it affirmed Parliament's authority to legislate for the colonies \"in all cases whatsoever,\" essentially asserting that Parliament had the right to pass laws affecting the colonies, regardless of whether the colonists agreed or not.\n\n4. **Townshend Acts (1767)** - Placed duties on various goods imported into the colonies, such as paper, paint, lead, glass, and tea. While these were described as external taxes rather than internal ones like the Stamp Act, they still generated significant opposition among the colonists.\n\n5. **Tea Act (1773)** - Lowered the price of taxed tea exported to the colonies to help the British East India Company undersell smuggled Dutch tea. This act led directly to the Boston Tea Party in December 1773, where colonists dumped tea into Boston Harbor to protest the taxes and the monopoly granted to the East India Company.\n\n6. **Intolerable Acts (1774)** - Consisting of several laws enacted in response to the Boston Tea Party, including:\n   - The Massachusetts Government Act, which altered the Massachusetts charter and restricted town meetings.\n   - The Administration of Justice Act, which allowed royal officials charged with capital crimes to face trial in England instead of the colonies.\n   - The Boston Port Act, which closed the port of Boston until damages from the Tea Party were paid.\n   - The Quartering Act, which allowed royal governors to house British troops in occupied buildings without the consent of the property owners.\n\nThese acts and taxes were significant in escalating tensions between the colonies and Great Britain, leading to growing resistance movements and ultimately contributing to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.", "shortest_response": "The passage outlines several key taxes and acts that contributed to the tensions leading up to the American Revolution.

This act was particularly contentious as it was seen as a violation of the principle of \"no taxation without representation,\" since the colonists had no representation in the British Parliament.\n\n3. **Townshend Acts (1767)**: These acts placed duties on goods like paper, glass, and tea, and established a Board of Customs in Boston to enforce trade regulations. The intention was to raise revenue and assert Parliament's authority over the colonies. The colonists organized boycotts in response.\n\n4. **Tea Act (1773)**: This act allowed the British East India Company to sell tea directly to the colonies at a lower price, bypassing colonial merchants. This was intended to save the company from bankruptcy and enforce Parliament's right to tax the colonies. The act led to the Boston Tea Party, where colonists destroyed a shipment of tea to protest the taxes.\n\nThese acts, among others, increased colonial resentment toward British rule and contributed significantly to the revolutionary sentiments that led to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.", "input_size": 2529, "output_sizes": [365, 403, 347, 406, 435, 361, 502, 329, 380, 435], "output_mean": 396.3, "output_std": 48.74, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 362.0, "p50": 391.5, "p75": 427.75, "p99": 495.97}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "information_extraction", "gen_time": 48.55797}, {"sample_id": "54062a021943cf13", "prompt_id": "500b6580602e9d77", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "What is the Foresight discipline?", "longest_response": "\"Foresight\" as a discipline can be broadly defined as the systematic and intentional process of thinking about the future.

A significant number of historians have stated that Salamis is one of the most significant battles in human history (though the same is often stated of Marathon). In a more extreme form of this argument, some historians argue that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis, the ensuing conquest of Greece by the Persians would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as we know it. This view is based on the premise that much of modern Western society, such as philosophy, science, personal freedom and democracy are rooted in the legacy of Ancient Greece. Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the domination of much of modern history by Western Civilization, Persian domination of Greece might have changed the whole trajectory of human history. It is also worth mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential Athenian culture occurred only after the Persian wars were won.\n\nFrom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Salamis", "longest_response": "The Battle of Salamis, fought in 480 BC, is indeed considered one of the most significant battles in human history by many historians due to its profound impact on the course of Western civilization. The battle was a pivotal naval engagement between the Greek city-states and the Persian Empire, which sought to conquer and subjugate the Greek world.\n\nSeveral key factors contribute to why historians consider Salamis so significant:\n\n1. **Desperate Circumstances**: The battle took place under extremely challenging conditions for the Greeks. They were outnumbered and facing a formidable opponent in the form of the vast Persian fleet. The victory against such odds is seen as a testament to the ingenuity and bravery of the Greek forces.\n\n2. **Unlikely Odds**: Despite being heavily outnumbered, the Greek fleet managed to achieve a decisive victory. This outcome is often viewed as a classic example of how smaller, more united groups can triumph over larger, less cohesive ones.\n\n3. **Impact on Western Civilization**: Many historians argue that had the Greeks lost at Salamis, it could have led to the conquest of all of Greece by the Persian Empire. This hypothetical scenario suggests that the subsequent stifling of Greek culture and political systems could have altered the development of Western civilization significantly. Concepts such as democracy, philosophy, and scientific inquiry, which have their roots in ancient Greek thought, might not have flourished or evolved in the way they did.\n\n4. **Cultural Legacy**: Following the victory at Salamis, Athens experienced a period of unprecedented cultural and intellectual growth. This era, known as the Golden Age of Athens, saw the emergence of seminal figures like Pericles, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, who laid foundational ideas that continue to influence modern societies today.\n\n5. **Strategic Importance**: The victory at Salamis not only halted the immediate Persian advance but also boosted Greek morale and unity. It set the stage for further resistance and ultimately contributed to the defeat of the Persian forces in subsequent battles, notably the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC.\n\nIn summary, the Battle of Salamis is significant not just because of its immediate military outcome but also because of its far-reaching implications for the future direction of Western civilization. The preservation of Greek independence and culture following this battle allowed for the continuation and flourishing of ideas and practices that have profoundly shaped modern societies.", "shortest_response": "The Battle of Salamis, fought in 480 BCE, is indeed considered one of the most significant battles in human history by many historians. The primary reasons for this high regard include:\n\n1. **Preservation of Greek Independence**: The battle marked a crucial turning point in the Greco-Persian Wars, where the outnumbered Greek fleet managed to defeat the larger Persian navy. This victory significantly weakened the Persian Empire's position in Greece and preserved Greek independence.\n\n2. **Impact on Western Civilization**: Many historians argue that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis, it could have led to the conquest of all of Greece by the Persian Empire. This hypothetical scenario suggests that the subsequent stifling of Greek culture and development could have dramatically altered the course of Western civilization. Since much of modern Western society\u2014such as philosophy, science, personal freedoms, and democratic governance\u2014is rooted in the legacy of Ancient Greece, these historians posit that a Persian victory might have led to a very different trajectory for human history.\n\n3. **Cultural and Intellectual Legacy**: After the Greek victories over the Persians, including the Battle of Salamis, there was a flourishing of Athenian culture, which produced seminal works in literature, philosophy, and art that continue to influence modern thought and culture.\n\n4. **Strategic Importance**: The strategic location of Salamis allowed the Greeks to leverage their naval strengths against the Persians, who had numerical superiority but were less adept at maneuvering in confined waters. This tactical advantage underscored the importance of adaptability and innovation in warfare.\n\nIn summary, the Battle of Salamis is highly regarded not just for its immediate historical impact but also for its profound implications on the development of Western civilization and the cultural advancements that followed.", "input_size": 301, "output_sizes": [424, 367, 386, 417, 375, 467, 382, 355, 389, 481], "output_mean": 404.3, "output_std": 40.14, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 376.75, "p50": 387.5, "p75": 422.25, "p99": 479.74}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "closed_qa", "gen_time": 21.66885}, {"sample_id": "f68926c20f76c7ec", "prompt_id": "2ae3ab9d55255052", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Based on the reference text, provide a one sentence overview of Dogecoin\nContext: Dogecoin (/\u02c8do\u028a(d)\u0292k\u0254\u026an/ DOHJ-koyn or DOHZH-koyn, Abbreviation: DOGE; sign: \u00d0) is a cryptocurrency created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system as a \"joke\", making fun of the wild speculation in cryptocurrencies at the time.

She would stare out of her window as planes soared through the sky, imagining what it would be like to soar among the clouds. But despite her fascination, she had never actually boarded one herself. Her family had always preferred road trips or train journeys, finding them more comfortable and less stressful than flying.\n\nSo when Ella received an invitation from her aunt in New Zealand for her 25th birthday, she knew this was her chance. It was a long way to go, but she was determined. After weeks of preparation, the day finally arrived. Ella stood at the airport, her heart pounding with excitement and a little bit of fear. She clutched her boarding pass tightly, feeling like a child on Christmas morning.\n\nThe security check was a blur of beeps and buzzes, but soon enough, Ella found herself sitting in the departure lounge, sipping a small cup of coffee that tasted suspiciously of cardboard. As the minutes ticked by, she felt a mix of anticipation and dread. What if something went wrong? What if she couldn't handle the height? What if she got airsick?\n\nBut then the flight attendants began to call for passengers, and Ella took a deep breath. This was it. She walked towards the gate, her steps steady despite the butterflies in her stomach. As she boarded the plane, she looked around in awe at the rows of seats and the bustling activity of the crew. The engines roared to life, and soon the plane was taxiing down the runway, accelerating faster and faster until it lifted off into the air.\n\nElla gripped the armrests tightly, eyes fixed on the tiny world below. She could see the curvature of the Earth, the vast expanse of blue stretching out beneath her. It was beautiful, breathtaking. For a moment, all her fears melted away. She was flying, truly flying, and it was exhilarating.\n\nHours passed, and Ella's initial nervousness turned into a sense of peace. She watched the sun set over the ocean, its light painting streaks of gold and pink across the clouds. She talked to the passenger next to her, a friendly old man who shared stories of his own travels. By the time the plane began its descent, Ella felt like she had made a friend for life.\n\nAs the plane touched down, there was a collective sigh of relief from the passengers. Ella stepped off the plane, her legs wobbly but her heart full of joy. She had done it. She had flown.\n\nBut as she waited to collect her luggage, a young woman approached her, her face pale and drawn. \"Excuse me,\" she said softly, \"are you Ella?\"\n\nElla nodded, puzzled. \"Yes, I am. Do we know each other?\"\n\nThe woman hesitated, then said, \"I'm sorry to tell you this, but your aunt... she passed away last week. We thought you should know before you arrived.\"\n\nElla felt the ground drop out from under her. Her aunt, the reason for her trip, the person she was so excited to see, was gone. She had flown halfway around the world for a funeral instead of a celebration.\n\nIn that moment, the beauty of the flight, the thrill of the takeoff, all seemed hollow. Ella's first flight had ended not with triumph but with loss.

Ella woke up early, her heart racing with anticipation. She dressed carefully in her favorite outfit, packed her bag with care, and made sure she had all her documents ready. Her mother gave her a warm hug and wished her luck as she left for the airport.\n\nAt the airport, Ella was both thrilled and a little nervous. She watched as passengers boarded the plane, each one looking forward to their own destination. When it was her turn, she felt a mix of emotions\u2014excitement, fear, and a dash of homesickness. But she took a deep breath, straightened her shoulders, and walked onto the plane.\n\nThe flight was smooth and beautiful. As the plane ascended, Ella pressed her face against the window, watching the ground shrink beneath her. The view was breathtaking, and she couldn't help but feel small yet significant in this vast expanse of blue sky and white clouds.\n\nHours later, as the plane descended towards Charles de Gaulle Airport, Ella felt a mix of sadness and happiness. Sadness because she would be leaving her mother behind, and happiness because she was finally here, in the city of lights, to celebrate her friend's birthday.\n\nBut as soon as she stepped off the plane, her joy turned to confusion when she saw her friend waiting with somber faces. It wasn't until they led her to a quiet corner that she learned the devastating news\u2014her mother had passed away suddenly while she was in the air.\n\nIn that moment, the beauty of the sky and the promise of the trip faded into insignificance. Ella realized that no matter how far she traveled or how much she experienced, nothing could fill the void left by the loss of someone she loved.

It was co-directed by Jack Lee and Richard (Dick) Mason, and featured Reg Livermore (in his first film role) as one of the 'narrators'.\n\nOne of the regular duties of the CFU at this time was the production of short films that were purpose-made for overseas distribution and were intended to promote Australia as an attractive destination for migrants and tourists. From the Tropics to the Snow marked a significant break with the traditional style of such features, and is noted for its subversive and satirical approach to its subject.\n\nRather than using the stilted, authoritative single-voice narration that was typical of such 'promotion documentaries' at the time, Mason and Lee opted for a strikingly reflexive approach, using a lively (and frequently tongue-in-cheek) multi-voice narration, which is introduced through the dramatic device of a production planning meeting between the film's Producer-in-Chief (Alexander Archdale), the director (Alastair Smart) and the screenwriter (Livermore). This allowed the film to become an ironic critique of itself, humorously examining the mechanics of \"documentary\" film construction, and the competing pressures and choices that faced filmmakers when creating such films. It also gently parodied Lee and Mason's own situation as \"young turks\" charged with turning out what were in essence \"production-line\" propaganda films for a hidebound government department.\n\nThe film co-won the Australian Film Institute's Gold Medal for Best Film in 1965.", "longest_response": "Yes, \"From the Tropics to the Snow\" won an award.

This transition included going from hand production methods to machines; new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes; the increasing use of water power and steam power; the development of machine tools; and the rise of the mechanized factory system. Output greatly increased, and a result was an unprecedented rise in population and in the rate of population growth. The textile industry was the first to use modern production methods,\u200a and textiles became the dominant industry in terms of employment, value of output, and capital invested.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, and many of the technological and architectural innovations were of British origin. By the mid-18th century, Britain was the world's leading commercial nation, controlling a global trading empire with colonies in North America and the Caribbean. Britain had major military and political hegemony on the Indian subcontinent; particularly with the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal, through the activities of the East India Company. The development of trade and the rise of business were among the major causes of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in history. Comparable only to humanity's adoption of agriculture with respect to material advancement, the Industrial Revolution influenced in some way almost every aspect of daily life. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. Some economists have said the most important effect of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population in the Western world began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries. GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy, while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies. Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in human history since the domestication of animals and plants.\n\nThe precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and social changes.Eric Hobsbawm held that the Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s, while T. S. Ashton held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830.Rapid industrialisation first began in Britain, starting with mechanized textiles spinning in the 1780s, with high rates of growth in steam power and iron production occurring after 1800. Mechanized textile production spread from Great Britain to continental Europe and the United States in the early 19th century, with important centres of textiles, iron and coal emerging in Belgium and the United States and later textiles in France.\n\nAn economic recession occurred from the late 1830s to the early 1840s when the adoption of the Industrial Revolution's early innovations, such as mechanized spinning and weaving, slowed and their markets matured. Innovations developed late in the period, such as the increasing adoption of locomotives, steamboats and steamships, and hot blast iron smelting. New technologies such as the electrical telegraph, widely introduced in the 1840s and 1850s, were not powerful enough to drive high rates of growth. Rapid economic growth began to occur after 1870, springing from a new group of innovations in what has been called the Second Industrial Revolution. These innovations included new steel making processes, mass production, assembly lines, electrical grid systems, the large-scale manufacture of machine tools, and the use of increasingly advanced machinery in steam-powered factories", "longest_response": "The Industrial Revolution, spanning roughly from 1760 to 1840, marked a significant transformation in manufacturing processes primarily in Great Britain, continental Europe, and the United States. It involved a shift from manual labor to machine-based manufacturing, advancements in iron production, and the introduction of steam power. This period also saw the rise of the mechanized factory system and a substantial increase in productivity and output. Key industries like textiles were at the forefront of adopting these new methods, leading to unprecedented growth in population and economic activity. The revolution led to profound societal changes, including improvements in living standards, although the benefits were more pronounced in the late 19th and 20th centuries. The timeline and pace of these changes are still subjects of historical debate, but the overall impact on human progress is considered monumental, second only to the agricultural revolution in terms of its transformative effects.", "shortest_response": "The Industrial Revolution, spanning approximately from the mid-18th century to the mid-19th century, marked a significant transformation from manual labor to machine-based manufacturing.

Here are some popular ways to cook a steak:\n\n1. **Grilling**: This is one of the most common methods for cooking steaks. Preheat your grill to high heat. Place the steak on the grill and sear it for about 4-5 minutes per side for a medium-rare finish. Adjust the time based on the thickness of the steak and your desired doneness.\n\n2. **Pan-searing**: Heat a skillet over medium-high heat with a small amount of oil or butter. Once hot, place the steak in the pan and sear each side for about 3-5 minutes, depending on the thickness and desired doneness. For an extra layer of flavor, you can add garlic, herbs, or wine to the pan during cooking.\n\n3. **Broiling**: Preheat your oven's broiler. Place the steak on a rack in a baking dish and put it under the broiler. Cook for about 4-6 minutes per side, adjusting the distance from the heat source as needed. This method works well for thinner cuts of steak.\n\n4. **Sous-vide**: This method involves sealing the steak in a vacuum bag and cooking it in a water bath at a precise temperature. After cooking, the steak is often finished by searing it quickly in a hot pan or on a grill to get a nice crust. Sous-vide cooking ensures even cooking throughout the steak.\n\n5. **Oven-roasting**: Preheat your oven to a high temperature (around 400\u00b0F or 200\u00b0C). Sear the steak in a hot skillet first to create a crust, then transfer it to a roasting pan and finish it in the oven for about 10-15 minutes, again depending on the thickness and desired doneness.\n\n6. **Smoking**: Smoking adds a unique, smoky flavor to the steak. It requires a smoker or a modified grill setup. Smoke the steak for a longer period at a lower temperature, typically around 225\u00b0F (107\u00b0C), until it reaches your preferred internal temperature.\n\nEach method has its own nuances and can produce different flavors and textures, so you might want to experiment with them to find your favorite way to cook a steak!", "shortest_response": "Cooking a steak can be an enjoyable and delicious experience. Here are several methods you can use to cook a steak:\n\n1. **Grilling**: This is one of the most popular methods for cooking steaks.

Make sure your grill is hot before you place the steak on it.\n\n2. **Pan-Seared**: For indoor cooking, pan-searing is a great option. Use a cast-iron skillet or a heavy-bottomed pan over high heat with a small amount of oil. Sear the steak for a few minutes on each side until it reaches your desired level of doneness.\n\n3. **Oven Broiling**: This method is useful if you want to cook thicker cuts of steak. Preheat your oven's broiler, place the steak on a broiler pan, and put it under the broiler. Keep an eye on it as it cooks quickly.\n\n4. **Sous Vide**: This method involves cooking the steak in a vacuum-sealed bag at a precise temperature in a water bath. Once cooked to the desired temperature, the steak is often finished with a quick sear in a hot pan to get that crusty exterior.\n\n5. **Barbecue (Low and Slow)**: Cooking a steak low and slow over indirect heat can give it a tender texture and a rich flavor. This method works well for tougher cuts like flank steak.\n\n6. **Stovetop with Butter and Garlic**: For a simple yet flavorful approach, cook the steak in a pan on the stovetop and add butter and garlic towards the end of cooking.

Dependent communist governments were installed in the Eastern Bloc satellite states. After becoming the world's second nuclear power, the Soviet Union established the Warsaw Pact alliance, and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the Cold War, with the rivaling United States and NATO. After Stalin's death in 1953 and a short period of collective rule, the new leader Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin and launched the policy of de-Stalinization, releasing many political prisoners from the Gulag labor camps. The general easement of repressive policies became known later as the Khrushchev Thaw. At the same time, Cold War tensions reached its peak when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the United States Jupiter missiles in Turkey and Soviet missiles in Cuba.\n\nIn 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, thus starting the Space Age. Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit the Earth, aboard the Vostok 1 manned spacecraft on 12 April 1961. Following the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, another period of collective rule ensued, until Leonid Brezhnev became the leader. The era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was later designated as the Era of Stagnation. The 1965 Kosygin reform aimed for partial decentralisation of the Soviet economy. In 1979, after a communist-led revolution in Afghanistan, Soviet forces invaded the country, ultimately starting the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. In May 1988, the Soviets started to withdraw from Afghanistan, due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens.\n\nFrom 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in an attempt to end the period of economic stagnation and to democratise the government. This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements across the country. Prior to 1991, the Soviet economy was the world's second-largest, but during its final years, it went into a crisis.\n\nBy 1991, economic and political turmoil began to boil over as the Baltic states chose to secede from the Soviet Union. On 17 March, a referendum was held, in which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into a renewed federation. In June 1991, Boris Yeltsin became the first directly elected president in Russian history when he was elected president of the Russian SFSR. In August 1991, a coup d'\u00e9tat attempt by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led to the end of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. On 25 December 1991, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, along with contemporary Russia, fourteen other post-Soviet states emerged.", "longest_response": "The Soviets pulled out of their war in Afghanistan due to a combination of factors that included international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support among Soviet citizens. The Afghan conflict, also known as the Soviet-Afghan War, lasted from 1979 to 1989. During this period, the Soviet Union faced significant challenges:\n\n1. **International Opposition**: The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was met with widespread condemnation from the international community, particularly from Western countries like the United States. The U.S., along with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, provided financial, military, and diplomatic support to the mujahideen, the resistance fighters opposing the Soviet-backed Afghan government. This international backing bolstered the effectiveness of the mujahideen and increased the cost of the Soviet occupation both politically and militarily.\n\n2. **Persistent Guerrilla Warfare**: The Afghan mujahideen employed guerrilla tactics, making them highly effective against the Soviet army. These tactics included hit-and-run attacks, ambushes, and sabotage, which made it difficult for the Soviets to establish control over the country. The rugged terrain of Afghanistan further complicated Soviet efforts, as they were unfamiliar with the environment and struggled to adapt to the guerrilla warfare style.\n\n3. **Lack of Support Among Soviet Citizens**: As the war dragged on, it became increasingly unpopular within the Soviet Union. The high casualty rates and the perceived futility of the war effort led to growing domestic opposition.

This led to a significant overvaluation of many stocks, as prices rose far beyond their actual value.\n\n2. **Economic Disparities**: During the 1920s, there was a large gap between the rich and the poor. The majority of the wealth was concentrated among the upper class, while the lower and middle classes struggled. This disparity meant that a large portion of the population did not have the purchasing power to sustain economic growth.\n\n3. **Consumer Debt**: Many consumers were heavily in debt due to the widespread use of installment plans for purchasing goods. When people had to cut back on spending due to economic uncertainties or job losses, this further reduced demand and economic activity.\n\n4. **Agricultural Troubles**: Agricultural prices had been falling throughout the 1920s due to overproduction and decreased demand. Farmers, who made up a significant portion of the workforce, were facing financial difficulties, which affected overall economic stability.\n\n5. **Banking Practices**: Banks were often poorly regulated and many engaged in risky lending practices, including providing loans for speculative investments in the stock market. When the market crashed, many banks faced runs from depositors worried about losing their savings.\n\n6. **International Economic Conditions**: The U.S. economy was interconnected with the global economy, and issues abroad, such as the war debts and reparations from World War I, contributed to economic instability. Additionally, countries around the world were also struggling with their own economic issues, leading to a global economic downturn.\n\n7. **Lack of Regulation**: Prior to the crash, there was little regulation of the stock market. This lack of oversight allowed for fraudulent activities and manipulations that contributed to the speculative bubble.\n\n8. **Psychological Factors**: As the market reached its peak, there was a sense of euphoria and optimism among investors. However, when prices started to fall, panic set in, leading to a rapid sell-off of stocks.\n\nThese factors combined to create an unstable economic environment that ultimately culminated in the dramatic crash of the stock market in October 1929, followed by years of economic hardship known as the Great Depression.", "shortest_response": "The 1929 U.S. stock market crash, which marked the beginning of the Great Depression, was caused by a combination of factors:\n\n1. **Speculation and Over-Valued Stocks**: During the 1920s, many investors bought stocks on margin, meaning they borrowed money to buy more stocks in hopes of earning higher returns. This practice contributed to inflated stock prices that were not supported by the underlying value of the companies.\n\n2. **Economic Disparities**: There was a significant gap between the rich and the poor, with much of the economic growth benefiting the wealthy rather than the general population. This disparity limited overall consumer spending power.\n\n3. **Agricultural Decline**: The agricultural sector faced significant challenges due to overproduction and falling crop prices, which affected rural economies and reduced demand for industrial goods.\n\n4. **Credit Expansion**: Banks and financial institutions were lending excessively, contributing to an economic bubble. When this bubble burst, it led to widespread defaults and bank failures.\n\n5. **International Economic Conditions**: Post-World War I debts and reparations put pressure on European economies, limiting their ability to buy American goods and exacerbating global economic instability.\n\n6. **Lack of Regulation**: There was little government regulation of the stock market, allowing for practices that could lead to market instability.\n\n7. **Overproduction and Underconsumption**: Industrial production had outpaced consumption, leading to a surplus of goods that businesses struggled to sell, contributing to declining profits and layoffs.\n\n8. **Media and Public Sentiment**: Media reports and public sentiment played a role in amplifying fears and contributing to the panic selling that followed the initial downturn.\n\nThese factors combined to create a volatile environment that eventually culminated in the dramatic stock market crash of October 1929, leading to years of economic hardship known as the Great Depression.", "input_size": 47, "output_sizes": [377, 400, 486, 463, 409, 453, 436, 503, 483, 503], "output_mean": 451.3, "output_std": 42.27, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 415.75, "p50": 458.0, "p75": 485.25, "p99": 503.0}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "open_qa", "gen_time": 19.7833}, {"sample_id": "17a58fe0bf5a6730", "prompt_id": "2daf46e1f5c9211a", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Given this paragraph on French Revolution, what were the main causes\nContext: The French Revolution (French: R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise [\u0281ev\u0254lysj\u0254\u0303 f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b\u02d0z]) was a period of radical political and societal change in France that began with the Estates General of 1789 and ended with the formation of the French Consulate in November 1799. Many of its ideas are considered fundamental principles of liberal democracy, while the values and institutions it created remain central to French political discourse.\n\nIts causes are generally agreed to be a combination of social, political and economic factors, which the Ancien R\u00e9gime proved unable to manage. In May 1789, widespread social distress led to the convocation of the Estates General, which was converted into a National Assembly in June. Continuing unrest culminated in the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July, which led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, including the abolition of feudalism, the imposition of state control over the Catholic Church in France, and extension of the right to vote.", "longest_response": "The French Revolution, which began in 1789, was triggered by a complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors that the pre-revolutionary French monarchy, known as the Ancien R\u00e9gime, was unable to address effectively. Here are some of the main causes:\n\n1. **Social Inequality**: French society was divided into three estates, or classes. The First Estate comprised the clergy, the Second Estate included the nobility, and the Third Estate encompassed the vast majority of the population, including peasants, urban workers, and the bourgeoisie (middle class). The first two estates enjoyed significant privileges and exemptions from taxation, while the Third Estate bore the brunt of financial burdens. This inequality fueled resentment among the lower classes.\n\n2. **Financial Crisis**: By the late 18th century, France was facing severe financial difficulties due to costly wars (such as the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War) and lavish spending by the royal court at Versailles. These financial issues led to high taxes on the already impoverished peasantry and the middle class, exacerbating their dissatisfaction with the government.\n\n3. **Political Absolutism**: The French monarchy under Louis XVI was characterized by absolute rule, where the king held ultimate authority and often made decisions without consulting the broader populace. This lack of political representation and the centralized power structure contributed to a sense of alienation among the people.\n\n4. **Enlightenment Ideas**: The Enlightenment, a philosophical movement of the 18th century, emphasized reason, individualism, and skepticism towards traditional authority. Philosophers like Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Montesquieu criticized absolutism and advocated for democracy, equality, and constitutional governance. These ideas spread widely and inspired the revolutionary spirit among the French people.\n\n5. **Failure of Reform Efforts**: Attempts at reform, such as those initiated by King Louis XVI's minister, Charles Alexandre de Calonne, failed to address the underlying issues of inequality and financial mismanagement. Instead, these reforms often led to further discontent and calls for more radical changes.\n\n6. **Rise of Public Opinion**: With the advent of new media forms, such as pamphlets and newspapers, public opinion became a powerful force. The ability to disseminate revolutionary ideas quickly and widely helped mobilize support for the revolution and criticize the existing regime.\n\nThese factors combined to create an environment ripe for revolution, leading to the convocation of the Estates-General in 1789 and ultimately to the storming of the Bastille, marking the beginning of the French Revolution.", "shortest_response": "The main causes of the French Revolution can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Social Inequality**: The French society was divided into three estates. The First Estate comprised the clergy, the Second Estate included the nobility, and the Third Estate consisted of the common people, who were the majority but had the least power and wealth. This rigid class structure led to significant social discontent among the lower classes.\n\n2. **Economic Crisis**: France faced severe financial difficulties in the late 18th century due to extravagant spending by the monarchy, costly wars (including support for the American Revolution), and poor harvests leading to food shortages and rising prices. These conditions exacerbated the poverty of the Third Estate.\n\n3. **Political Unrest**: The absolute monarchy under Louis XVI was seen as inefficient and corrupt. The king's inability to implement effective reforms and his perceived indifference to the plight of the common people fueled resentment and demands for more representative governance.\n\n4. **Enlightenment Ideas**: Philosophers such as Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montesquieu promoted ideas about liberty, equality, and the rights of man, which challenged traditional structures of authority and inspired revolutionary thinking.\n\n5. **Failure of Reform Efforts**: Early attempts at reform, like those proposed by Turgot and Necker, failed to address the underlying issues effectively. The Estates-General convened in 1789 was intended to resolve the fiscal crisis but instead became a catalyst for broader calls for change.\n\n6. **Crisis of Legitimacy**: The monarchy's legitimacy was weakened by its failure to manage the country's crises effectively and by the influence of Enlightenment thinkers who questioned the divine right of kings.\n\nThese factors combined to create an environment ripe for revolution, leading to the dramatic events of the French Revolution.", "input_size": 256, "output_sizes": [372, 470, 524, 360, 405, 467, 415, 483, 431, 394], "output_mean": 432.1, "output_std": 49.98, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 396.75, "p50": 423.0, "p75": 469.25, "p99": 520.31}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "closed_qa", "gen_time": 23.31316}, {"sample_id": "8cae087fc447251e", "prompt_id": "f244eadc50946d5f", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Please write some key points on Booker prize from the given passage.\nContext: The 2022 Booker Prize was a literary award given for the best English novel of the year.

Here are five reasons why on-prem could be preferred over cloud solutions:\n\n1. **Data Security and Privacy**: On-premises systems offer greater control over data security. Since the data is stored within the organization's own facilities, it can be protected with physical security measures and customized security protocols that might not be as easily customizable in a cloud environment. This is particularly important for industries dealing with sensitive information such as healthcare, finance, and government.\n\n2. **Performance and Latency**: For applications requiring high performance and low latency, on-premises solutions can provide a significant advantage. Since data doesn\u2019t need to travel over the internet or through third-party networks, the speed of data processing can be faster, which is crucial for real-time applications like financial trading platforms or online gaming.\n\n3. **Compliance Requirements**: Certain regulations mandate that data must be stored within specific geographic regions or countries. For example, the European Union\u2019s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) requires that personal data of EU citizens be stored within the EU. In such cases, maintaining an on-premises data center can ensure compliance with these regulations more easily.\n\n4. **Cost Control**: While cloud services often promise cost savings through pay-as-you-go pricing models, the long-term costs can sometimes exceed those of on-premises solutions, especially if an organization needs to scale significantly or if data transfer fees become substantial. On-premises solutions allow for a fixed-cost environment where you know exactly what you're paying for, without unexpected spikes in usage costs.\n\n5. **Customization and Control**: On-premises solutions provide more flexibility for customization and integration with existing systems. Businesses can tailor their hardware and software environments precisely to their needs, ensuring optimal performance and efficiency. Additionally, they have full control over updates and maintenance schedules, allowing them to manage system downtime according to their own timelines rather than those dictated by a cloud service provider.\n\nThese advantages highlight why some organizations might prefer on-premises solutions over cloud-based ones, depending on their specific requirements and priorities.", "shortest_response": "While the cloud offers numerous advantages such as scalability and accessibility, there are scenarios where on-premises infrastructure can be preferable. Here are five reasons why on-prem might be considered better in certain situations:\n\n1. **Control and Security**: On-premises solutions allow for greater control over security measures, including physical access to servers and data centers. This can be crucial for organizations dealing with sensitive information that must comply with strict regulatory requirements.\n\n2. **Performance and Latency**: For applications requiring minimal latency and maximum performance, on-premises solutions can offer lower network latency compared to cloud services, especially if the cloud service involves cross-regional or international connections.\n\n3. **Customization**: On-premises infrastructure allows for more customization options without being constrained by the limitations of a shared environment. Organizations can tailor their hardware and software configurations precisely to meet specific needs.\n\n4. **Cost Predictability**: While cloud services often start with low upfront costs, they can lead to unpredictable expenses due to variable usage rates. On-premises solutions, while having higher initial setup costs, can provide more predictable long-term costs, especially for large-scale operations.\n\n5. **Data Sovereignty**: In some regions, data sovereignty laws require that data be stored within national borders.

The more you move around while you\u2019re saying your lines, the easier it will be to remember them when you\u2019re actually on stage.\n\n5. **Record Yourself**: Ask a grown-up to help you record yourself saying your lines. Then, listen to it over and over again. It\u2019s like having a little helper that reminds you how it should sound.\n\n6. **Practice Before Bed**: Right before you go to sleep, say your lines out loud.

By the end of the 3rd millennium BCE, it had evolved into a complex system capable of recording not only Sumerian but also other languages such as Akkadian, Eblaite, Elamite, Hittite, Luwian, and Urartian.\n\nThe script was primarily written on clay tablets, which could be easily inscribed with a stylus and baked hard in the sun or fire for preservation. These tablets served as records for trade, legal transactions, literature, and religious texts. Additionally, cuneiform was used for monumental inscriptions carved into stone or metal, although this was less common due to the laborious nature of carving compared to writing on clay.\n\nDeciphering cuneiform was a significant achievement in the field of archaeology and linguistics, accomplished in the 19th century by scholars like Henry Rawlinson and Georg Friedrich Grotefend.

It is the second longest-lived radioisotope of iodine, after iodine-129.\nIts half-life is 59.49 days and it decays by electron capture to an excited state of tellurium-125. This state is not the metastable 125mTe, but rather a lower energy state that decays immediately by gamma decay with a maximum energy of 35 keV. Some of the excess energy of the excited 125Te may be internally converted ejected electrons (also at 35 keV), or to x-rays (from electron bremsstrahlung), and also a total of 21 Auger electrons, which are produced at the low energies of 50 to 500 electron volts. Eventually, stable ground state 125Te is produced as the final decay product.\nIn medical applications, the internal conversion and Auger electrons cause little damage outside the cell which contains the isotope atom. The X-rays and gamma rays are of low enough energy to deliver a higher radiation dose selectively to nearby tissues, in \"permanent\" brachytherapy where the isotope capsules are left in place (125I competes with palladium-103 in such uses)\nBecause of its relatively long half-life and emission of low-energy photons which can be detected by gamma-counter crystal detectors, 125I is a preferred isotope for tagging antibodies in radioimmunoassay and other gamma-counting procedures involving proteins outside the body. The same properties of the isotope make it useful for brachytherapy, and for certain nuclear medicine scanning procedures, in which it is attached to proteins (albumin or fibrinogen), and where a half-life longer than that provided by 123I is required for diagnostic or lab tests lasting several days.\nIodine-125 can be used in scanning/imaging the thyroid, but iodine-123 is preferred for this purpose, due to better radiation penetration and shorter half-life (13 hours). 125I is useful for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) testing in the diagnosis or monitoring of patients with kidney disease.

The island was known by various names, including Temasek (meaning \"Sea Town\") in the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\n### Early Modern Period\nIn the late 14th century, Singapore was ruled by the Sultanate of Malacca, and later it came under the influence of the Sultanate of Johor. During this period, Singapore was a small trading port but did not hold significant political power.\n\n### British Colonization\nIn 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles, an official of the British East India Company, arrived in Singapore and signed a treaty with Sultan Hussein Shah of Johor, allowing the British to develop the island as a trading post. This marked the beginning of British colonial rule over Singapore, which would last until 1963.\n\nUnder British administration, Singapore grew rapidly as a free port, attracting immigrants from across Asia. The city became a key center for trade, finance, and commerce, serving as a crucial link between Europe and the East.\n\n### World War II and Post-War Period\nDuring World War II, Singapore fell to Japanese forces in February 1942 after a brief but intense battle. The Japanese occupation lasted until the end of the war in 1945. After the war, Singapore returned to British control, but there was growing demand for self-governance among the population.\n\n### Merger and Independence\nIn 1963, Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia along with Malaya, Sabah, and Sarawak. However, tensions arose due to ethnic and economic disparities, leading to Singapore's separation from Malaysia in 1965. On August 9, 1965, Singapore officially became an independent nation.\n\n### Rapid Development\nFollowing independence, Singapore faced numerous challenges, including high unemployment and a lack of natural resources. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who served from 1959 to 1990, the government embarked on ambitious economic and social development programs. These efforts transformed Singapore into a modern, industrialized nation with a highly skilled workforce and a robust economy.\n\nSingapore focused on developing its manufacturing sector, particularly in electronics and petrochemicals, while also fostering a strong service industry. The government implemented policies to ensure racial harmony and promote meritocracy, contributing to social stability and economic growth.\n\n### Contemporary Era\nToday, Singapore is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, with a highly developed market economy.

This can significantly lower watering needs, saving both time and resources.\n\n3. **Fall Preparation**: As plants begin to go dormant in fall, adding a layer of mulch can protect the roots of perennial plants from cold temperatures and freeze-thaw cycles. This is particularly beneficial for sensitive or newly planted specimens.\n\n4. **Winter Protection**: In colder climates, a thick layer of mulch can insulate the soil and protect plant roots from extreme cold. However, it's important not to apply it too early in autumn, as this could delay the hardening-off process of plants.\n\n5. **After Planting New Trees or Shrubs**: Applying mulch around newly planted trees and shrubs can help them establish more quickly by maintaining consistent soil moisture and temperature levels.\n\n6. **Around Perennials and Annuals**: Mulching around these plants can help suppress weeds and maintain soil moisture, reducing competition for nutrients and water.\n\n7. **In Flower Beds and Vegetable Gardens**: Mulching these areas can improve soil health over time as organic mulches decompose, providing nutrients to the soil.\n\n8. **Before and After Heavy Rainfall**: In regions with heavy rainfall, mulch can help prevent soil erosion and keep soil from splashing onto plants, potentially reducing the spread of diseases.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while mulch offers many benefits, it should be applied correctly to avoid issues like root rot due to excessive moisture or pest infestations. A general guideline is to apply a 2-3 inch layer of mulch, keeping it away from the base of plants to prevent rot and disease.", "shortest_response": "Mulching is an excellent practice for enhancing the health and appearance of your landscape. Here are some key times and reasons to use mulch:\n\n1. **Spring**: As plants start to grow in spring, applying a fresh layer of mulch can help suppress weeds, retain soil moisture, and regulate soil temperature.\n\n2. **Fall**: Applying mulch in the fall helps insulate plant roots from harsh winter temperatures and can protect plants from extreme cold and frost heaving. It's especially beneficial for newly planted trees and shrubs.\n\n3. **After Planting**: When you plant new trees, shrubs, or perennials, adding a layer of mulch around them can help establish their root systems by maintaining consistent soil moisture and temperature.\n\n4. **Before Extreme Weather Conditions**: If you expect particularly hot summers or cold winters, adding a layer of mulch can provide extra protection to your plants.\n\n5. **Regular Maintenance**: Even if there isn't a specific event or season, it\u2019s good practice to check your mulch regularly. Replenish as needed to maintain a 2-3 inch layer around plants, ensuring that it does not touch the base of the plant to prevent rot.\n\nUsing mulch at these times can significantly enhance the health and beauty of your garden while reducing maintenance efforts.

Why do other scholars and practitioners think that campaigns do matter?", "longest_response": "Scholars and political analysts often have differing views on the impact of campaign activities on the outcome of presidential elections. These differences arise from various theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence.\n\n### Scholars Who Think Campaigns Do Not Matter Much\n\n1. **Incumbency Advantage**: Some scholars argue that the incumbent president has a significant advantage over challengers due to factors like name recognition, access to media, and control over government resources. This advantage can make it difficult for challengers to overcome, regardless of their campaign efforts.\n\n2. **Economic Voting**: The economic conditions during an incumbent's term are seen as a more decisive factor in election outcomes than campaign activities. Voters tend to reward or punish incumbents based on the state of the economy, which is beyond the immediate influence of campaign strategies.\n\n3. **Partisan Affiliation**: Long-term trends in party affiliation and voter loyalty can overshadow the effects of campaign activities. If a large portion of voters identify strongly with one party, they may vote along party lines regardless of the campaign messages.\n\n4. **Media Skepticism**: Some scholars believe that modern media environments have made it harder for campaigns to significantly sway public opinion. With a diverse array of information sources and the rise of echo chambers, campaign messages might not reach or resonate with enough undecided voters to change the overall outcome.\n\n### Scholars and Practitioners Who Think Campaigns Do Matter\n\n1. **Swing Voters**: While many voters are partisan and will vote along party lines, there is still a segment of the electorate\u2014swing voters\u2014that can be influenced by campaign messages. Effective campaigning can persuade these voters to support a candidate.\n\n2. **Policy Platforms and Issue Focus**: Campaigns provide opportunities for candidates to articulate their policy platforms and address key issues that concern voters. A well-crafted message that resonates with voters' concerns can differentiate candidates and affect voting behavior.\n\n3. **Mobilization Efforts**: Campaigns play a crucial role in mobilizing supporters to actually go out and vote. This includes get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts, which can be particularly important in close races where turnout can make the difference between winning and losing.\n\n4. **Fundraising and Resource Allocation**: Campaigns also involve fundraising, which provides the resources necessary for effective advertising, staffing, and organizing. Candidates who raise more money are often better equipped to run a competitive campaign.\n\n5. **Media Strategy**: Campaigns can strategically use media to shape narratives and counter opponents' messages. In a highly mediated environment, how a campaign is portrayed in the media can influence voter perceptions.\n\n6. **Personal Charisma and Debate Performance**: Candidates' personal qualities, such as charisma and debate performance, can be highlighted through campaigns. These elements can sway undecided voters and energize a candidate's base.\n\nIn summary, while some scholars emphasize structural factors like economic conditions and party loyalty, others focus on the dynamic role of campaign strategies in shaping voter preferences and mobilizing support. Both perspectives contribute to a nuanced understanding of how presidential elections are won or lost.", "shortest_response": "Scholars who argue that presidential election campaigns do not matter much often base their views on several key points:\n\n1. **Economic Conditions**: Some scholars emphasize the importance of economic conditions, such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and inflation, in shaping voter preferences. These conditions are largely out of a candidate's control during the campaign period and can significantly influence how voters perceive the incumbent or the challenger.\n\n2. **Party Identification**: Another factor is party identification. Many voters have strong ties to a particular political party, and these affiliations can heavily influence their voting behavior. In many cases, party loyalty may be stronger than any persuasive effect a campaign might have.\n\n3. **Incumbency Advantage**: Incumbent presidents often benefit from structural advantages like name recognition, media access, and government resources. This advantage can overshadow the impact of campaign activities.\n\nOn the other hand, scholars and practitioners who believe that campaigns do matter highlight several reasons:\n\n1. **Media Coverage and Persuasion**: Campaigns provide opportunities for candidates to present their platforms, respond to criticisms, and shape public opinion through media coverage. Effective campaigning can sway undecided voters or mobilize supporters.\n\n2. **Voter Mobilization**: Campaigns are crucial for getting supporters to the polls. High-turnout elections can be decisive, especially if they involve significant mobilization efforts by one side over the other.\n\n3. **Policy Proposals and Debate Performance**: Debates and discussions of policy proposals can clarify differences between candidates and inform voters about specific issues. A strong performance in debates can boost a candidate's standing among undecided voters.\n\n4. **Fundraising and Organization**: The ability to raise funds and organize a robust campaign infrastructure can make a difference in reaching voters effectively and efficiently.\n\nIn summary, while some scholars focus on broader structural factors like economic conditions and party loyalty, others highlight the direct impact of campaign strategies, media presence, and voter engagement.

The yeast consumes the sugars and begins to produce carbon dioxide and ethanol.\n\n2. **Gas Production:** As the yeast metabolizes the sugars, it releases carbon dioxide gas bubbles. These bubbles get trapped within the dough's structure.\n\n3. **Gluten Network:** Flour contains proteins called glutenin and gliadin. When mixed with water and kneaded, these proteins form a stretchy network known as gluten. This network traps the carbon dioxide bubbles produced by the yeast, allowing the dough to expand.\n\n4. **Leavening:** As more and more carbon dioxide is produced, the dough continues to rise until it has doubled in size or more, depending on the recipe and conditions.\n\n5. **Proofing:** After the initial rise, the dough may be shaped and allowed to rise again before baking. This secondary rise is often referred to as proofing. It allows for further expansion and helps develop flavor and texture.\n\n6. **Baking:** When the bread is baked, the heat causes the gases to expand rapidly, giving the final product its airy texture. The heat also kills the yeast and sets the structure of the bread.\n\nIn addition to yeast, chemical leaveners like baking powder or baking soda can also be used to make bread rise, especially in quick breads where there isn't enough time for yeast to fully ferment the dough.

The battle lasted for five weeks from 16 December 1944 to 28 January 1945, towards the end of the war in Europe. It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region between Belgium and Luxembourg. It overlapped with the Alsace Offensive, subsequently the Colmar Pocket, another series of battles launched by the Germans in support of the Ardennes thrust.\n\nThe primary military objectives were to deny further use of the Belgian Port of Antwerp to the Allies and to split the Allied lines, which potentially could have allowed the Germans to encircle and destroy the four Allied forces. The Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, who since December 1941 had assumed direct command of the German army, believed that achieving these objectives would compel the Western Allies to accept a peace treaty in the Axis powers' favor. By this time, it was palpable to virtually the entire German leadership including Hitler himself that they had no realistic hope of repelling the imminent Soviet invasion of Germany unless the Wehrmacht was able to concentrate the entirety of its remaining forces on the Eastern Front, which in turn obviously required that hostilities on the Western and Italian Fronts be terminated. The Battle of the Bulge remains among the most important battles of the war, as it marked the last major offensive attempted by the Axis Powers on the Western front. After their defeat, Germany would retreat for the remainder of the war.\n\nThe Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December 1944, due to a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather. American forces bore the brunt of the attack. The Germans attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line, taking advantage of heavily overcast weather conditions that grounded the Allies' superior air forces. Fierce American resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive, around Elsenborn Ridge, and in the south, around Bastogne, blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success. Columns of armor and infantry that were supposed to advance along parallel routes found themselves on the same roads. This congestion, and terrain that favored the defenders, threw the German advance behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops.\n\nThe farthest west the offensive reached was the village of Foy-N\u00f4tre-Dame, south east of Dinant, being stopped by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division on 24 December 1944. Improved weather conditions from around 24 December permitted air attacks on German forces and supply lines, which sealed the failure of the offensive. On 26 December the lead element of Patton's U.S. Third Army reached Bastogne from the south, ending the siege. Although the offensive was effectively broken by 27 December, when the trapped units of 2nd Panzer Division made two break-out attempts with only partial success, the battle continued for another month before the front line was effectively restored to its position prior to the attack. In the wake of the defeat, many experienced German units were out of men and equipment, and the survivors retreated to the Siegfried Line.\n\nThe Germans' initial attack involved around 410,000 men; just over 1,400 tanks, tank destroyers, and assault guns; 2,600 artillery pieces; and over 1,000 combat aircraft, as well as large numbers of other armored fighting vehicles (AFVs). These were reinforced a couple of weeks later, bringing the offensive's total strength to around 450,000 troops, and 1,500 tanks and assault guns. Between 63,222 and 103,900 of these men were killed, missing, wounded in action, or captured. The battle severely depleted Germany's armored forces, which remained largely unreplaced throughout the remainder of the war. German Luftwaffe personnel, and later also Luftwaffe aircraft (in the concluding stages of the engagement) also sustained heavy losses.\n\nFrom among the Americans' peak strength of 610,000 troops there were 75,500 battle casualties, including about 8,400 killed. The \"Bulge\" was the largest and bloodiest single battle fought by the United States in World War II and the third-deadliest campaign in American history.", "longest_response": "The Battle of the Bulge is indeed a significant event in World War II history, characterized by several crucial points:\n\n1. **Timing and Location**: It took place from December 16, 1944, to January 28, 1945, in the Ardennes region between Belgium and Luxembourg, as part of the broader Western Front. The name \"Battle of the Bulge\" comes from the bulging shape on the map that resulted from the German offensive pushing into Allied territory.\n\n2. **German Strategy**: The main objectives were to split the Allied armies, capture the port of Antwerp, and force a political settlement favorable to Germany. Hitler hoped that a successful offensive would weaken the resolve of the Western Allies and allow Germany to focus entirely on the Eastern Front against the advancing Soviets.\n\n3. **Surprise Attack**: The Germans achieved complete surprise due to poor weather conditions that grounded Allied aircraft, leading to inadequate reconnaissance and intelligence gathering. Additionally, Allied commanders were more focused on their own planned offensive operations rather than anticipating a German counter-attack.\n\n4. **Allied Resistance**: Despite the initial shock, American forces, particularly at key locations such as Elsenborn Ridge and Bastogne, put up strong resistance, blocking critical roadways and disrupting German plans. The U.S. 2nd Armored Division played a crucial role in halting the German advance near Dinant.\n\n5. **Role of Air Power**: As weather improved, Allied air superiority became a decisive factor. The U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) and the Royal Air Force (RAF) provided critical support, bombing German positions and supply lines, which significantly hindered German mobility and supply capabilities.\n\n6. **Siege of Bastogne**: One of the most notable events was the siege of Bastogne, where U.S. troops under Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe successfully defended the town against multiple German assaults. Their stand was crucial in preventing the German advance from reaching its full potential.\n\n7. **Human Cost**: The battle was extremely costly in terms of human life. The Germans suffered between 63,222 and 103,900 casualties, while the Americans had approximately 75,500 battle casualties, including nearly 8,400 killed. It is considered one of the deadliest battles for American forces in the war.\n\n8. **Impact on German Forces**: The battle severely depleted Germany's armored and air power resources, which could not be fully replaced in the final months of the war. This marked a significant turning point, as the German forces never regained their previous strength or initiative.\n\n9. **Symbolic Significance**: For both sides, the Battle of the Bulge represented a pivotal moment. For the Allies, it underscored the resilience and determination of American soldiers and highlighted the effectiveness of combined arms warfare. For Germany, it signified the beginning of the end, as they could no longer mount a major offensive operation.\n\nIn summary, the Battle of the Bulge was a critical confrontation that showcased the complexities of modern warfare, the importance of logistics and air support, and the enduring spirit of soldiers on both sides of the conflict.", "shortest_response": "The Battle of the Bulge, a significant event during World War II, is notable for several key points:\n\n1. **Timing and Context**: Launched on December 16, 1944, this was the final major German offensive on the Western Front. It occurred at a time when the Allies were preparing their own offensive and the German High Command recognized the urgency of halting the advancing Allied forces to focus on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union.\n\n2. **German Strategy**: The objective was twofold: to cut off and isolate the Allies in the north from those in the south by capturing Antwerp, thus weakening the Allied position and possibly forcing them into negotiations. The operation aimed to split the Allied forces and create a bulge in their defensive line.\n\n3. **Surprise Attack**: The Germans achieved a significant level of surprise due to poor Allied intelligence, favorable weather conditions that grounded Allied air support, and a weakly defended sector of the Allied front.\n\n4. **Key Battles and Resistance**: Critical resistance came from the U.S. forces around Elsenborn Ridge and Bastogne. The latter saw a heroic defense by the 101st Airborne Division, which held out until relieved by General George S. Patton's Third Army.\n\n5. **Impact of Weather**: While initially aiding the German advance, worsening weather conditions later provided an opportunity for Allied air power to intervene decisively against German ground operations.\n\n6. **Outcome and Casualties**: Despite initial successes, the German offensive was ultimately halted and reversed. The battle resulted in significant losses for both sides but particularly for the Germans, who lost crucial armored units that were not replaced. For the Allies, it was the costliest battle in terms of casualties.\n\n7. **Historical Significance**: The Battle of the Bulge marked the last major German offensive of the war and demonstrated the resilience and adaptability of the Allied forces.

Through it all, she clung to her dreams, her passion for art, and her unwavering belief in the power of self-expression. She started small, selling her paintings at local markets, then online, slowly building a reputation and a community of supporters who believed in her as much as she believed in herself.\n\nBut Ava's journey was not just about professional success; it was about personal discovery. She explored the city, delving deep into its history, culture, and diversity. She met people from all walks of life, each one adding a unique thread to the tapestry of her experience. Through conversations, collaborations, and sometimes even conflicts, she began to unravel the layers of her identity, discovering facets of herself she never knew existed.\n\nThere were moments of doubt, of course. Times when the weight of expectations, both her own and those of others, felt suffocating. But Ava learned to listen to the voice within, the one that whispered encouragement and reminded her of her worth. She found solace in nature, in the parks and gardens of the city, where she could breathe deeply and reconnect with the essence of who she was beyond the labels and roles society imposed upon her.\n\nAs years passed, Ava transformed. Not just externally, but internally. She became more confident, more compassionate, and more connected to her true self. Her art reflected this journey, evolving from colorful abstractions to pieces that told stories of struggle, resilience, and hope. Her work resonated with people, touching hearts and inspiring minds across the nation.\n\nBut perhaps the greatest transformation was within. Ava realized that self-actualization wasn't about achieving some external goal or reaching a certain level of success. It was about embracing every part of oneself, the light and the shadow, the joy and the pain, and living authentically from that place of wholeness. She understood that her journey was far from over, that life was a continuous process of becoming, but she was no longer afraid of what lay ahead.\n\nIn the end, Ava's story is one of courage, creativity, and the unyielding pursuit of truth. It's a reminder that in the vast landscape of America, and indeed in the world at large, there is room for everyone to find their path, to express themselves freely, and to live a life that truly reflects who they are at their core.", "shortest_response": "In the sprawling landscape of dreams and aspirations that is America, I found myself as a young woman, navigating through the labyrinth of my own existence. The journey began on the shores of a distant land, where the air was thick with the promise of freedom and opportunity, yet the waters were cold and treacherous. My heart beat with the rhythm of a thousand hopes, each one a step towards self-discovery.\n\nThe first few years were a blur of adjustment\u2014learning new languages, adapting to new customs, and trying to find my place in a world that seemed both welcoming and daunting. I remember the nights spent under the glow of streetlights, poring over books and papers, my mind racing with thoughts of what I could become, who I wanted to be. Each page turned was a step forward, a whisper of the potential that lay within me.\n\nAs time passed, I began to see the threads of my identity weaving together, not just from the fabric of my past but also from the vibrant tapestry of experiences that America offered. I discovered passions I never knew I had, challenges that pushed me to grow, and people whose stories intertwined with mine, enriching my understanding of the human experience.\n\nBut it wasn't always smooth sailing. There were moments when the weight of expectations, both from within and without, felt suffocating. Moments when I questioned whether I was truly making a difference, if my voice mattered in this vast sea of voices. It was during these times that I learned the most profound lesson: true strength comes not from never faltering, but from rising again after every fall.\n\nThrough volunteer work in community centers, advocating for causes close to my heart, and pushing the boundaries of my professional capabilities, I started to carve out my own path. Each success, no matter how small, was a testament to my resilience and determination. And with each setback, I grew stronger, more compassionate, and more deeply connected to the world around me.\n\nSelf-actualization, I realized, isn\u2019t about reaching a final destination but about embracing the journey itself\u2014the continuous process of learning, evolving, and finding meaning in the tapestry of life. In America, I found not only a home but a mirror reflecting back the person I am becoming, day by day.\n\nAnd so, here I stand, a young woman who has traveled far and wide, not just across continents but through the depths of her soul.

Traditionally, triathlon is an individual sport and each athlete is competing against the course and the clock for the best time. As such, athletes are not allowed to receive assistance from anyone else outside the race, with the exception of race-sanctioned aid volunteers who distribute food and water on the course.\n\n\nTransition area (bicycles) of Hamburg Triathlon, 2002\nTriathlons are timed in five sequential sections:\n\nfrom the start of the swim to the beginning of the first transition (swim time);\nfrom the beginning of the first transition to the end of the first transition (T1 time);\nfrom the start of the cycling to the end of the cycling leg (cycling time);\nfrom the beginning of the second transition to the end of the second transition (T2 time);\nfinally from the start of the run to the end of the run, at which time the triathlon is completed.\nResults are usually posted on official websites and will show for each triathlete his/her swim time; cycle time (with transitions included); run time; and total time. Some races also post transition times separately.\n\nOther rules of triathlon vary from race to race and generally involve descriptions of allowable equipment (for example, wetsuits are allowed in USAT events in the swimming stage of some races when the water temperature is below 25.6 \u00b0C (78.1 \u00b0F)), and prohibitions against interference between athletes. Additionally, the use of flippers or other swim propulsion and flotation aids are illegal in triathlon and can result in disqualification.\n\nOne rule involving the cycle leg is that the competitor's helmet must be donned before the competitor mounts (or even takes possession of, in certain jurisdictions) the bike, and it must remain on until the competitor has dismounted; the competitor may not be required to wear the helmet when not on the bicycle (e.g. while repairing a mechanical problem). Failure to comply with this rule will result in disqualification. Additionally, while on the bike course, all bicycles shall be propelled only by human force and human power. Other than pushing a bicycle, any propulsive action brought on by use of the hands is prohibited. Should a competitor's bike malfunction they can proceed with the race as long as they are doing so with their bicycle in tow. There are also strict rules regarding the 'bike mount' line. Competitors may not begin riding their bicycle out of transition until they are over a clearly marked line. Mounting the bike prior to this may incur a penalty (example: a 15-second time penalty at the London 2012 Olympics was imposed on Jonathan Brownlee, a competitor from Great Britain, for mounting his bike too early.)\n\nOther time penalties can be incurred during the race for, among other things, drafting on the bike in a non-drafting race, improper passing, littering on course, and unsportsmanlike conduct.", "longest_response": "The traditional triathlon consists of three main disciplines: swimming, cycling, and running. These segments are interspersed with two transitions, known as T1 and T2, where athletes change from one discipline to another. Here\u2019s a breakdown of each section:\n\n1. **Swimming Segment**: This is the initial part of the triathlon, where athletes start with a swim. The distance varies based on the type of triathlon, but common distances include 750 meters for Olympic-distance triathlons. Athletes typically start in the water or from a beach or dock. Safety measures are put in place, such as lifeguards and safety boats, to ensure participants\u2019 safety. Wetsuits are often allowed in colder water conditions.\n\n2. **First Transition (T1)**: After completing the swim, athletes make their way to the transition area, which is a designated zone where bikes are parked. In T1, athletes transition from swim gear to cycling gear. This includes changing into cycling clothes, putting on a helmet, and getting their bike ready to ride. The efficiency and speed of this transition can significantly impact overall race performance.\n\n3. **Cycling Segment**: Following T1, athletes begin the cycling portion of the race. Distances vary widely depending on the event, ranging from 20 km for shorter triathlons to 180 km for Ironman-distance races. Cyclists must adhere to helmet regulations and maintain control of their bicycles throughout this segment. Drafting (riding closely behind another cyclist to reduce wind resistance) is generally prohibited unless specified otherwise for certain types of races.\n\n4. **Second Transition (T2)**: Upon finishing the cycling segment, athletes enter T2, transitioning from cycling gear to running gear. This involves changing shoes, removing helmets, and preparing for the final running segment. Efficient transitions here can also provide a competitive edge.\n\n5. **Running Segment**: The final part of the triathlon is the run, which concludes the event. Distances range from 5 km for sprint triathlons up to 42.2 km (a full marathon) for Ironman races. This segment tests athletes' endurance and mental fortitude as they push through to the finish line.\n\nEach of these segments is timed individually, and the total elapsed time is the sum of these segments plus the transition times. Results are typically posted on official websites, detailing each athlete's performance in each segment as well as their overall placement.\n\nRules and regulations are designed to ensure fairness and safety, covering everything from equipment standards to behavior on the course.

The speed and efficiency of this transition are crucial for overall performance.\n\n3. **Cycling Section**:\n   - Following T1, athletes transition onto their bikes and ride a designated route, which is usually on roads and can include various terrains and conditions. Cyclists must adhere to helmet regulations and cannot receive external assistance unless permitted by race officials.\n\n4. **Second Transition (T2)**:\n   - Upon completion of the cycling segment, athletes return to the transition area to switch from their biking gear to running gear. This involves removing helmets, shoes, and possibly other accessories and preparing for the run.\n\n5. **Running Section**:\n   - The final phase of the triathlon is the run, where athletes complete a set distance on foot. This segment often tests endurance and mental strength, as competitors have already expended significant energy in the swim and bike portions.\n\nEach of these segments is timed individually, and the cumulative time determines the winner.

Walking is generally slower than running. Typically, people walk at speeds up to about 5 km/h (3 mph), while running can range from about 6 km/h (3.7 mph) for a slow jog to much faster speeds for competitive runners.\n\n2. **Body Posture and Movement**:\n   - **Walking**: In walking, one foot is always in contact with the ground, which means it's a double-support phase. This continuous ground contact allows for a more controlled and stable movement.\n   - **Running**: Running involves periods where both feet are off the ground simultaneously, known as the flight phase. This makes running a more dynamic form of movement compared to walking.\n\n3. **Mechanics**:\n   - **Walking**: When you walk, your center of gravity moves up and down slightly with each step. The leg that is not supporting your weight swings forward in a relatively straight line.\n   - **Running**: During running, your center of gravity tends to move up and down more significantly, especially if you're running fast. Your legs act more like pendulums, swinging through a larger arc.\n\n4. **Energy Efficiency**:\n   - **Walking**: Walking is generally considered more energy-efficient at lower speeds because it doesn't require the same level of muscular effort as running.\n   - **Running**: At higher speeds, running becomes more efficient than walking because it minimizes the time spent in contact with the ground, reducing friction and air resistance.\n\nUnderstanding these differences can help in choosing the appropriate activity based on personal fitness goals, such as improving cardiovascular health, building endurance, or simply enjoying a leisurely pace.", "shortest_response": "Walking and running are both forms of bipedal locomotion but they differ in several aspects:\n\n1. **Speed**: The most obvious difference is speed.

Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\u200a\nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.", "longest_response": "Michael Faraday and Georg Ohm are two pivotal figures in the history of electricity and electromagnetism.\n\n**Michael Faraday (1791-1867):**\nFaraday is renowned for his contributions to the understanding of electromagnetism and electrochemistry.

The name white hydrogen distinguishes it from green hydrogen, which is produced from renewable energy sources, and from grey, brown or black hydrogen, which is obtained from fossil sources or from the electrolysis of water. Natural hydrogen may be renewable, non-polluting and allows for lower cost operation compared to industrial hydrogen. Natural hydrogen has been identified in many source rocks in areas beyond the sedimentary basins where oil companies typically operate.\n\nOrigin of natural hydrogen\nThere are several sources of natural hydrogen:\n\n- degassing of deep hydrogen from the Earth's crust and mantle;\n- reaction of water with ultrabasic rocks (serpentinisation);\n- contact of water with reducing agents in the Earth's mantle;\n- interaction of water with freshly exposed rock surfaces (weathering);\n- decomposition of hydroxyl ions in the structure of minerals;\n- Natural radiolysis of water;\n- decomposition of organic matter;\n- biological activity\n- Extraction\n- Natural hydrogen is extracted from wells, mixed with other gases such as nitrogen or helium.\n\nSeveral sources have been identified in France. Geologists Alain Prinzhofer and Eric Derville have demonstrated the existence of large reservoirs in a dozen countries, including Mali and the United States. However, their potential remains difficult to assess.\n\nNumerous emanations on the ocean floor have been identified but are difficult to exploit. The discovery of a significant emergence in Russia in 2008 suggests the possibility of extracting native hydrogen in geological environments.\n\nGeology\nNatural hydrogen is generated continuously from a variety of natural sources. There are many known hydrogen emergences on mid-ocean ridges. Another of the known reactions, serpentinisation, occurs under the sea floor (in the oceanic crust).\n\nDiagenetic origin (iron oxidation) in the sedimentary basins of cratons, notably in Russia.

The battle was marked by fierce close-quarters combat and direct assaults on civilians in air raids, with the battle epitomizing urban warfare.The Battle of Stalingrad was the deadliest battle to take place during the Second World War. Today, the Battle of Stalingrad is universally regarded as the turning point in the European Theatre of war, as it forced the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German High Command) to withdraw considerable military forces from other areas in occupied Europe to replace German losses on the Eastern Front, ending with the rout of the six field armies of Army Group B, including the destruction of Nazi Germany's 6th Army and an entire corps of its 4th Panzer Army. The victory at Stalingrad energized the Red Army and shifted the balance of power in the favour of the Soviets.", "longest_response": "The Battle of Stalingrad was indeed one of the most significant and brutal battles of World War II, marking a critical turning point in the conflict. Here are several reasons why it was so important:\n\n1. **Turning Point on the Eastern Front**: Before the Battle of Stalingrad, the German forces had been making steady advances into Soviet territory, capturing cities such as Kiev, Minsk, and Smolensk. However, the failure at Stalingrad marked a significant shift in momentum, with the German forces suffering heavy losses and being unable to recover their earlier successes.\n\n2. **Strategic Importance**: Stalingrad (now Volgograd) held immense strategic value due to its location on the Volga River, which was a crucial transport route and symbol of industrial might for the Soviet Union. Control over the city would have allowed Germany to cut off southern supply routes to the Caucasus oil fields, vital for both fueling the German war machine and denying resources to the Soviet Union.\n\n3. **Human Cost and Fierceness**: The battle is notorious for its brutality and high casualties. It involved intense urban warfare, with fighting often taking place within buildings, factories, and even sewers. Both sides suffered tremendous losses, with estimates ranging from 700,000 to over 2 million total casualties, making it one of the deadliest battles in human history.\n\n4. **Psychological Impact**: The battle had profound psychological effects on both the Axis and Allied powers. For the Soviet Union, the victory at Stalingrad was a significant morale booster, demonstrating their ability to withstand and counterattack against the seemingly unstoppable German advance. Conversely, the defeat marked a severe blow to German morale and prestige, leading to increased skepticism about the war effort among both soldiers and civilians.\n\n5. **Resource Drain for Germany**: The battle resulted in a massive drain of German resources and manpower. The loss of nearly 300,000 troops, along with equipment and supplies, severely weakened the German position on the Eastern Front. This resource strain forced the German High Command to divert resources from other fronts, weakening their overall war effort.\n\n6. **End of Blitzkrieg Effectiveness**: The prolonged nature of the battle and the heavy losses inflicted on the German forces demonstrated that the blitzkrieg tactics used successfully earlier in the war were no longer effective against determined defenders. This realization led to changes in German military strategy and tactics.\n\nIn summary, the Battle of Stalingrad was pivotal because it not only halted the German advance but also signaled the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany's ambitions in the Soviet Union. It shifted the balance of power decisively in favor of the Allies and set the stage for further Soviet offensives that would ultimately lead to the liberation of Eastern Europe and the fall of Nazi Germany.", "shortest_response": "The Battle of Stalingrad was one of the most significant battles in World War II for several reasons:\n\n1. **Turning Point**: It marked a critical turning point in the war on the Eastern Front and, by extension, in the entire European theater. Prior to Stalingrad, the Germans had been advancing relentlessly across the Soviet Union, but their defeat there ended this momentum.\n\n2. **Casualties and Losses**: The battle was one of the deadliest in history, with estimates of total casualties ranging from approximately 700,000 to over 2 million soldiers and civilians killed, wounded, or captured. This staggering number of casualties underscored the brutal nature of the conflict.\n\n3. **Strategic Importance**: Stalingrad was a major industrial city located on the banks of the Volga River, which served as a vital transportation route and symbol of Soviet resistance. Its capture would have allowed the Germans to control the southern oil fields and cut off Soviet access to the Caucasus region, severely weakening the Soviet war effort.\n\n4. **Impact on German Forces**: The loss of the German 6th Army and the destruction of much of the 4th Panzer Army significantly depleted German military resources. These units were among the best-trained and equipped in the German army, and their annihilation dealt a severe blow to German morale and capabilities.\n\n5. **Psychological Impact**: The victory at Stalingrad boosted Soviet morale and demonstrated to the world that the Soviet Union could withstand and defeat the seemingly invincible German Wehrmacht. It also showed the Allies that the Germans could be defeated, bolstering international support for the Soviet cause.\n\n6. **Shift in Power Dynamics**: Following the battle, the Soviets began a series of successful counteroffensives that gradually pushed the Germans back towards Berlin. This shift in momentum fundamentally altered the course of the war, setting the stage for the eventual Allied victory.\n\nIn summary, the Battle of Stalingrad was pivotal not only due to its scale and the sheer number of casualties but also because it represented a definitive shift in the balance of power between the Axis and Allied forces in Europe.", "input_size": 258, "output_sizes": [465, 447, 433, 455, 500, 482, 463, 444, 436, 570], "output_mean": 469.5, "output_std": 38.82, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 444.75, "p50": 459.0, "p75": 477.75, "p99": 563.7}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "summarization", "gen_time": 25.64651}, {"sample_id": "c393e939e6fee3ad", "prompt_id": "d11327133719331f", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Why are people migrating in the US from the NE and Mid-West to the South and SE?", "longest_response": "People are migrating from the Northeast (NE) and Midwest regions of the United States to the South and Southeast for a variety of reasons, often driven by economic opportunities, cost of living, climate, and lifestyle preferences.

Festivals like Chinese New Year, Hari Raya (Eid), Deepavali, and Christmas are celebrated with great enthusiasm, allowing for a rich tapestry of traditions and customs to be experienced firsthand.\n\n### Education\nEducation is highly valued in Singapore, and the education system is designed to be rigorous yet supportive. Schools emphasize academic excellence, but also encourage extracurricular activities such as sports, music, and community service. Students often find themselves participating in a variety of clubs and societies, which not only enrich their educational experience but also help them develop a sense of belonging and community.\n\n### Technology and Innovation\nBorn into a world where technology is increasingly integrated into daily life, growing up in Singapore means being surrounded by cutting-edge innovations.

The National Gallery Singapore, for example, showcases both local and international art, providing a platform for creative expression and appreciation of diverse artistic styles.\n\n### Sports and Fitness\nSports play a significant role in the lives of many young Singaporeans. Whether it's through school sports teams, community clubs, or national programs like the SportCares scheme, there are ample opportunities to stay active and healthy. Popular sports include soccer, badminton, and swimming, reflecting both traditional and contemporary interests.\n\n### Challenges and Balances\nWhile life in Singapore is generally comfortable and well-structured, there are challenges too. The cost of living can be high, and the competitive nature of society can sometimes put pressure on individuals to excel academically and professionally. However, there is also a strong emphasis on work-life balance, with policies promoting family-friendly environments and encouraging downtime.\n\n### Sense of Belonging\nDespite the fast pace and constant changes, there is a strong sense of belonging among Singaporeans. This is partly due to the shared values of respect for others, integrity, and a commitment to making Singapore a better place. Community spirit is evident in initiatives like neighborhood clean-ups, charity events, and volunteer work.\n\nIn summary, growing up in Singapore after 1985 is an experience marked by a blend of cultural richness, technological innovation, and a strong sense of community.

For someone who enjoys their time here, the city-state offers a vibrant mix of culture, education, and lifestyle that shapes a fulfilling childhood.\n\nOne of the first things that come to mind is the multicultural environment. Singapore is a melting pot of different cultures, with influences from Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Western traditions. Festivals like Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, Deepavali, and Christmas are celebrated with great enthusiasm, providing a rich tapestry of cultural experiences. Local festivals are not just about religious observances but also involve community gatherings, food fairs, and public displays, fostering a sense of unity and diversity among residents.\n\nEducation is another significant aspect of life in Singapore. The education system is highly regarded globally for its rigorous standards and emphasis on academic excellence.

While it can be challenging, there's a strong support network from family, teachers, and peers, which helps in navigating this journey. The focus on education is deeply ingrained in the society, reflecting the belief that knowledge is key to success.\n\nSingapore\u2019s green spaces and parks provide ample opportunities for outdoor activities and relaxation. From the lush Botanic Gardens to the serene MacRitchie Reservoir Park, these areas serve as popular spots for picnics, jogging, and cycling. The city\u2019s commitment to maintaining greenery amidst urban development is commendable and offers a respite from the hustle and bustle of city life.\n\nThe food scene in Singapore is another highlight. Street food hawker centers like Newton Food Centre and Tiong Bahru Market offer a wide array of dishes from all corners of the world, making it a paradise for food lovers. Enjoying a plate of chili crab or laksa is more than just a meal; it\u2019s an experience that connects one to the local flavors and heritage.\n\nLiving in Singapore also means embracing technology and innovation. As a leading tech hub, the city-state encourages the adoption of new technologies and supports startups.

It begins the observance of Allhallowtide, the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the faithful departed.\n\nOne theory holds that many Halloween traditions were influenced by Celtic harvest festivals, particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain, which are believed to have pagan roots. Some go further and suggest that Samhain may have been Christianized as All Hallow's Day, along with its eve, by the early Church. Other academics believe Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday, being the vigil of All Hallow's Day. Celebrated in Ireland and Scotland for centuries, Irish and Scottish immigrants took many Halloween customs to North America in the 19th century, and then through American influence Halloween had spread to other countries by the late 20th and early 21st century.\n\nPopular Halloween activities include trick-or-treating (or the related guising and souling), attending Halloween costume parties, carving pumpkins or turnips into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing, divination games, playing pranks, visiting haunted attractions, telling scary stories, and watching horror or Halloween-themed films. Some people practice the Christian religious observances of All Hallows' Eve, including attending church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead, although it is a secular celebration for others.

It operates based on the principle of controlling a large current with a small current, which allows it to act as an amplifier. Here's a simplified explanation of how a transistor amplifies a signal:\n\n### Basic Structure\nA typical bipolar junction transistor (BJT) consists of three layers of semiconductor material: the emitter (E), the base (B), and the collector (C). There are two types of BJTs: NPN and PNP, depending on the order of the layers.\n\n### Operation in Amplification Mode\n1. **Biasing**: To use a transistor for amplification, you need to bias it properly. This means applying voltages to the base-emitter and base-collector junctions so that they operate in the active region. In this region, the transistor can amplify signals.\n   \n2. **Base-Emitter Junction**: A small current flows from the emitter to the base when a small voltage is applied across the base-emitter junction. This current is called the base current (Ib).\n\n3. **Current Gain**: The key to amplification lies in the relationship between the base current and the collector current (Ic). In the active region, a small change in the base current results in a much larger change in the collector current. This ratio is known as the current gain (\u03b2), where Ic = \u03b2 * Ib.\n\n4. **Amplifying the Signal**: When a small alternating current (AC) signal is applied to the base, it modulates the base current. Due to the high current gain, this small change in base current causes a large change in the collector current. If this collector current is used to control a load (such as a speaker or another circuit element), the amplified version of the input signal appears at the output.\n\n5. **Output Signal**: The amplified signal is taken from the collector relative to the emitter (or sometimes the collector relative to ground, depending on the circuit configuration). The amplitude of the output signal is greater than that of the input signal due to the current amplification provided by the transistor.\n\n### Example Circuit\nIn a common emitter configuration, which is one of the most common configurations for amplifiers:\n- The input signal is applied to the base.\n- The output is taken from the collector, typically through a resistor that converts the current into a voltage.\n- The emitter is often grounded or connected to a fixed voltage through a resistor, which helps set the quiescent point (the operating point of the transistor when no signal is present).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe ability of a transistor to amplify a signal stems from its capacity to control a relatively large collector current using a smaller base current, effectively translating small changes in the input signal into larger changes in the output signal. This makes transistors invaluable components in a wide range of electronic devices, from audio amplifiers to radio transmitters.", "shortest_response": "A transistor amplifies a signal by controlling the flow of electrons between two terminals (the collector and the emitter) with a small input current or voltage applied to a third terminal (the base). This process allows a small change in the base current or voltage to result in a larger change in the collector current, effectively amplifying the input signal.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works in more detail:\n\n1. **Biasing**: To operate a transistor as an amplifier, it needs to be biased correctly. This means setting up a steady current through the transistor so that it operates in its active region where it can amplify signals.\n\n2. **Input Signal**: The input signal is applied to the base-emitter junction. If the input is a small alternating current (AC), it modulates the base current.\n\n3. **Current Amplification**: In the active region, a small change in the base current causes a much larger change in the collector current. This is because the transistor acts like a controlled switch, allowing a large current to flow from the collector to the emitter when a small current flows into the base.\n\n4. **Output Signal**: The amplified signal appears at the collector-emitter junction. Since the collector current is much larger than the base current, the output signal is an amplified version of the input signal.\n\n5. **Load Resistor**: Often, a load resistor is placed across the collector and emitter. As the collector current changes, the voltage drop across this resistor changes, which translates the amplified current into an amplified voltage.\n\nIn summary, a transistor amplifies a signal by using a small control signal (base current/voltage) to regulate a much larger current (collector current), thereby amplifying the input signal's strength.", "input_size": 37, "output_sizes": [596, 502, 484, 475, 563, 518, 345, 438, 396, 509], "output_mean": 482.6, "output_std": 70.8, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 447.25, "p50": 493.0, "p75": 515.75, "p99": 593.03}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 23.92201}, {"sample_id": "6ef550e230a3b10b", "prompt_id": "b321d0f41ca3912f", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Extract the names of persons and countries in two different lists separated by commas: \"Sunday\u2019s blast has echoes of the car bombing that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of influential ultra-nationalist philosopher Alexander Dugan in August 2022.

Some studies suggest that the first migrations could have taken place as early as 30,000 years ago, while others argue for a later date around 15,000 to 17,000 years ago, when the ice sheets covering much of North America had begun to recede and the land bridge was more passable.\n\nOnce in North America, these groups spread out across the continent, adapting to various environments and developing diverse cultures over thousands of years.

Here are some of the key reasons:\n\n1. **Economic Troubles**: The Soviet economy faced significant challenges, including inefficiency and stagnation. Despite its strength in heavy industry, the Soviet economy struggled with consumer goods production and technological innovation. Economic reforms initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev, such as Perestroika (restructuring) and Glasnost (openness), aimed to address these issues but often failed to deliver the expected results.\n\n2. **Political Reform and Loss of Control**: Gorbachev's policies of openness and restructuring also led to a loosening of control over the republics within the Soviet Union and an increase in political dissent. This created a situation where various ethnic groups and republics began to assert their independence more forcefully.\n\n3. **Nationalism and Ethnic Tensions**: As the central government weakened, nationalist movements in the republics gained momentum. These movements sought greater autonomy or outright independence from Moscow, leading to conflicts and secessionist sentiments that ultimately undermined the unity of the Soviet state.\n\n4. **Military Expenditures and Foreign Policy**: The arms race with the United States and the costly military interventions, most notably in Afghanistan, placed a heavy burden on the Soviet economy. These expenditures strained resources that could have otherwise been used for domestic development.\n\n5. **Ideological Challenges**: The rigid communist ideology faced challenges both internally and externally. Internally, it lost its appeal as people became disillusioned with the lack of freedom and economic prosperity promised by the system. Externally, the fall of communist regimes in Eastern Europe during 1989 further weakened the ideological foundation of the Soviet Union.\n\n6. **Leadership Changes**: The death of longtime leader Leonid Brezhnev in 1982 and the subsequent short tenures of Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko saw a period of leadership instability, which contributed to the weakening of the central authority. Gorbachev\u2019s attempts at reform were initially seen as a way to save the system, but they ultimately contributed to its unraveling.\n\n7. **The August Coup Attempt**: In 1991, a group of hardline Communist Party officials attempted a coup against Gorbachev, hoping to halt his reforms. Although the coup failed, it further destabilized the already fragile Soviet state and led to the arrest of many high-ranking officials who opposed reform.\n\nThese factors combined to create a situation where the Soviet Union could no longer maintain its status as a superpower. On December 26, 1991, the Soviet Union officially ceased to exist, replaced by the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), with Russia emerging as the largest and most powerful successor state.", "shortest_response": "The collapse of the Soviet Union was a complex process influenced by multiple factors over several decades. Here are some of the key reasons:\n\n1. **Economic Troubles**: The Soviet economy faced significant challenges due to inefficiencies in its centrally planned system.

These reforms inadvertently unleashed forces that they could not control, including increased political dissent and calls for greater autonomy or independence from the central government.\n\n3. **Nationalism and Ethnic Tensions**: As political freedoms increased, so did nationalist movements among the various republics within the USSR. These movements sought greater independence or even full secession from the Soviet Union, leading to ethnic conflicts and political instability.\n\n4. **Military Overreach**: The Soviet Union's involvement in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989 proved to be a costly endeavor both in terms of human lives and resources. This prolonged conflict further weakened the Soviet state.\n\n5. **External Pressures**: The Cold War placed immense pressure on the Soviet Union to compete with the United States in terms of military strength and technological advancement. This competition contributed significantly to economic strain.\n\n6. **Ideological Shifts**: The failure of the Soviet model to deliver prosperity comparable to that of the West led many people to lose faith in communism as an ideology. This ideological shift was critical in undermining the legitimacy of the Soviet state.\n\nThe culmination of these factors led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union on December 26, 1991, marking the end of the Cold War era and a significant geopolitical transformation of the world order.", "input_size": 36, "output_sizes": [572, 422, 385, 379, 566, 475, 557, 400, 451, 412], "output_mean": 461.9, "output_std": 72.8, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 403.0, "p50": 436.5, "p75": 536.5, "p99": 571.46}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "general_qa", "gen_time": 22.79941}, {"sample_id": "5006a6efaadac963", "prompt_id": "70225c15c2276953", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Classify each of these car manufacturers as either French, German, American, Japanese, or other: Lexus, Hyundai, Alfa Romeo, VW, Honda, GM, Citroen", "longest_response": "Here is the classification of each car manufacturer you listed:\n\n- **Lexus**: Japanese (Lexus is a luxury vehicle marque from Toyota Motor Corporation)\n- **Hyundai**: South Korean (Hyundai is a major automobile manufacturer based in Seoul, South Korea)\n- **Alfa Romeo**: Italian (Alfa Romeo is an Italian automobile manufacturer founded in Milan)\n- **VW (Volkswagen)**: German (Volkswagen is one of Germany's largest automakers and part of the Volkswagen Group)\n- **Honda**: Japanese (Honda is a Japanese multinational corporation primarily known for its motorcycles and automobiles)\n- **GM (General Motors)**: American (General Motors is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Detroit, Michigan)\n- **Citro\u00ebn**: French (Citro\u00ebn is a French automobile manufacturer founded in 1919)\n\nPlease note that Hyundai is not classified under any of the categories mentioned in your question (French, German, American, Japanese), so it would be categorized as \"other\" if strictly adhering to those options.", "shortest_response": "Here is the classification of each car manufacturer based on your request:\n\n- Lexus: Japanese (Lexus is a luxury vehicle division of Toyota)\n- Hyundai: South Korean (Hyundai is a major automaker from South Korea)\n- Alfa Romeo: Italian (Alfa Romeo is an Italian automobile manufacturer)\n- VW (Volkswagen): German (Volkswagen is one of Germany's largest automakers)\n- Honda: Japanese (Honda is a renowned Japanese automobile manufacturer)\n- GM (General Motors): American (General Motors is one of the largest American automakers)\n- Citro\u00ebn: French (Citro\u00ebn is a well-known French automobile manufacturer)", "input_size": 66, "output_sizes": [147, 169, 133, 143, 137, 177, 212, 136, 142, 162], "output_mean": 155.8, "output_std": 23.49, "output_percentiles": {"p25": 138.25, "p50": 145.0, "p75": 167.25, "p99": 208.85}, "top_k": 20, "top_p": 0.8, "temp": 0.7, "category": "classification", "gen_time": 7.76605}, {"sample_id": "6bbf2ba9b93ef9a5", "prompt_id": "878c2899c59dd8fd", "model": "Qwen--Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "dataset": "DollyDataset", "prompt_text": "Create a dialogue between two characters discussing the impact of social media on their lives.

It\u2019s scary how quickly false information can spread and influence people. But I think there are also ways social media can be used positively to combat that. For instance, many communities use it to share verified information and debunk myths.\n\n**Alex:** Yeah, and it\u2019s not just about personal connections or spreading news; social media plays a huge role in activism and awareness campaigns. Remember the #MeToo movement? It wouldn\u2019t have gained such widespread attention without platforms like Twitter and Facebook.\n\n**Jamie:** Right, and it\u2019s not just about large-scale movements.

It can really affect self-esteem and mental health.\n\n**Alex:** Yeah, it\u2019s definitely a concern. However, I think there\u2019s also a growing awareness around this issue. More and more people are sharing their struggles openly, which helps break down those unrealistic expectations. It\u2019s becoming a platform for support and real conversations too.\n\n**Jamie:** That\u2019s a good point.

Warm water is absorbed more quickly by the stems than cold water, helping the flowers stay hydrated longer.\n\n5. **Add Flower Food (Optional)**: If available, add flower food to the water. This contains nutrients and chemicals that help preserve the flowers. If you don't have flower food, you can use a solution of sugar and bleach instead to feed the flowers and inhibit bacterial growth.\n\n6. **Arrange the Flowers**: Start by putting the tallest flowers in the vase first, then fill in around them with shorter stems. Play around with the arrangement until you're satisfied with how it looks. Be gentle as you place each flower to avoid damaging the stems or petals.\n\n7. **Final Adjustments**: Once all the flowers are in the vase, make final adjustments to the height and angle of the stems to create a balanced look.

The most important factor in determining a yield curve is the currency in which the securities are denominated. The economic position of the countries and companies using each currency is a primary factor in determining the yield curve. Different institutions borrow money at different rates, depending on their creditworthiness.\n\nThe yield curves corresponding to the bonds issued by governments in their own currency are called the government bond yield curve (government curve). Banks with high credit ratings (Aa/AA or above) borrow money from each other at the LIBOR rates. These yield curves are typically a little higher than government curves. They are the most important and widely used in the financial markets, and are known variously as the LIBOR curve or the swap curve. The construction of the swap curve is described below.\n\nBesides the government curve and the LIBOR curve, there are corporate (company) curves. These are constructed from the yields of bonds issued by corporations. Since corporations have less creditworthiness than most governments and most large banks, these yields are typically higher. Corporate yield curves are often quoted in terms of a \"credit spread\" over the relevant swap curve. For instance the five-year yield curve point for Vodafone might be quoted as LIBOR +0.25%, where 0.25% (often written as 25 basis points or 25bps) is the credit spread.", "longest_response": "- **Government Bond Yield Curve (Government Curve):** This curve represents the yields of bonds issued by a government in its own currency. It reflects the cost of borrowing for the government and serves as a benchmark for other debt instruments within the same currency.\n  \n- **LIBOR Curve (Swap Curve):** This curve corresponds to the interbank lending rates, specifically the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), for banks with high credit ratings (Aa/AA or above). It is slightly higher than the government curve due to the lower risk associated with government borrowing compared to interbank loans. This curve is extensively used in financial markets for pricing and hedging derivatives.\n\n- **Corporate Yield Curve:** This curve is derived from the yields of bonds issued by corporations. Due to the lower creditworthiness of corporations compared to governments and large banks, these yields are typically higher. Corporate yield curves are often referenced relative to the swap curve using a \"credit spread,\" indicating the additional yield required by investors to compensate for the increased credit risk.", "shortest_response": "- **Government Bond Yield Curve (Government Curve)**: This curve represents the yields of bonds issued by governments in their own currency, reflecting the borrowing costs for sovereign entities.\n- **LIBOR Curve (Swap Curve)**: This curve is derived from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), indicating the interest rates at which major global banks lend to one another.
