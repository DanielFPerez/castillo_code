When they communicate with people, they do so to get what they need or want, such as food, affection, or play.\n\nCats use a range of communication methods such as vocal, visual, tactile and olfactory. Cats mostly meow to communicate with people, rarely with other animals. As such, the cats' communication methods have been significantly affected by domestication. Up to 21 different cat vocalizations have been studied. It is now evident that domestic cats meow more than feral cats.", "response": "Cat vocalizations have been categorized according to a range of characteristics. Originally suggested by Mildred Moelk, cat sounds are often divided into three main classes:\n\nsounds produced with the mouth closed (murmurs \u2013 purring, trilling)\nsounds produced when the mouth is first opened and then gradually closed (meowing, howling, yowling)\nsounds produced with the mouth held tensely open in the same position (growls, snarls, hisses, spits, chattering, and chirping).\nIn 1944, Moelk published the first phonetic study of cat sounds. She listened very carefully to her own cats and organized their sounds into 16 phonetic patterns divided into three main categories. She also used a phonetic alphabet to transcribe or write down the different sounds. She claimed that cats had six different forms of meows to represent friendliness, confidence, dissatisfaction, anger, fear and pain. Moelk classified eight other sounds involved in mating and fighting by listening to the animals in her yard and on the street.\n\nBrown et al. categorized vocal responses of cats according to the behavioral context: during separation of kittens from mother cats, during food deprivation, during pain, prior to or during threat or attack behavior, as in disputes over territory or food, during a painful or acutely stressful experience, as in routine prophylactic injections and during kitten deprivation. Less commonly recorded calls from mature cats included purring, conspecific greeting calls or murmurs, extended vocal dialogues between cats in separate cages, \"frustration\" calls during training or extinction of conditioned responses.\n\nMiller classified vocalizations into five categories according to the sound produced: the purr, chirr, call, meow and growl/snarl/hiss.\n\nOwens et al. categorized cat vocalizations based on their acoustic structures. There are three categories: tonal sounds, pulse sounds, and broadband sounds. Tonal sounds are further categorized into groups of harmonically structured sounds or regular tonal sounds. Pulse vocalizations are separated into pulse bursts and hybrid pulse bursts with tonal endings. Broadband sounds are separated into four groups: non-tonal broadband sounds, broadband sounds with tonal beginnings, broadband sounds with short tonal elements, and broadband sounds with long tonal endings.", "category": "information_extraction"}, {"instruction": "How did Draymond Green's minutes increase over time?", "context": "Green was selected with the 35th overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors.

In most cases multipurpose trees have a primary role; such as being part of a living fence, or a windbreak, or used in an ally cropping system. In addition to this they will have one or more secondary roles, most often supplying a family with food or firewood, or both.\n\nWhen a multipurpose tree is planted, a number of needs and functions can be fulfilled at once. They may be used as a windbreak, while also supplying a staple food for the owner. They may be used as fencepost in a living fence, while also being the main source of firewood for the owner.

This is split into a base case and a recursive case. The base case is given by the fact that the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, so fib(0)=0 and fib(1)=1. The recursive case is given by the fact that the nth Fibonacci number f_n can be written as the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers, so f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}.

He married a relative of Gaius Marius, the dictator of Rome at the time and furthered his political connections.

Caesar borrowed heavily and organized lavish games so that the people of Rome would know him. Unlike other patricians, Caesar had grown up in the Subura where, at the time, the plebeians lived and knew the importance and power that could be garnered from the love of the people.\n\nThrough multiple appointments, Caesar displayed his military genius and was eventually elected Consul. He formed an alliance with two other leading figures of the time: Pompey (a decorated general) and Crassus (richest man in Rome) known now as the \"First Triumvirate\". \n\nAfter his consulship, Caesar become Governor of Gaul and eventually won a lot of territory for Rome.

The proposal for the conference included this assertion: \"every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\".The participants included Ray Solomonoff, Oliver Selfridge, Trenchard More, Arthur Samuel, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon, all of whom would create important programs during the first decades of AI research. At the workshop Newell and Simon debuted the \"Logic Theorist\" and McCarthy persuaded the attendees to accept \"Artificial Intelligence\" as the name of the field. The 1956 Dartmouth workshop was the moment that AI gained its name, its mission, its first success and its major players, and is widely considered the birth of AI. The term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was chosen by McCarthy to avoid associations with cybernetics and connections with the influential cyberneticist Norbert Wiener.\n\nThe programs developed in the years after the Dartmouth Workshop were, to most people, simply \"astonishing\" computers were solving algebra word problems, proving theorems in geometry and learning to speak English. Few at the time would have believed that such \"intelligent\" behavior by machines was possible at all. Researchers expressed an intense optimism in private and in print, predicting that a fully intelligent machine would be built in less than 20 years. Government agencies like DARPA poured money into the new field.\n\nIn the 1970s, AI was subject to critiques and financial setbacks. AI researchers had failed to appreciate the difficulty of the problems they faced. Their tremendous optimism had raised expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding for AI disappeared. At the same time, the field of connectionism (or neural nets) was shut down almost completely for 10 years by Marvin Minsky's devastating criticism of perceptrons. Despite the difficulties with public perception of AI in the late 70s, new ideas were explored in logic programming, commonsense reasoning and many other areas.\n\nIn the 1980s a form of AI program called \"expert systems\" was adopted by corporations around the world and knowledge became the focus of mainstream AI research. In those same years, the Japanese government aggressively funded AI with its fifth generation computer project. Another encouraging event in the early 1980s was the revival of connectionism in the work of John Hopfield and David Rumelhart. Once again, AI had achieved success.\n\nThe business community's fascination with AI rose and fell in the 1980s in the classic pattern of an economic bubble. The collapse was due to the failure of commercial vendors to develop a wide variety of workable solutions. As dozens of companies failed, the perception was that the technology was not viable. However, the field continued to make advances despite the criticism. Numerous researchers, including robotics developers Rodney Brooks and Hans Moravec, argued for an entirely new approach to artificial intelligence.\n\nThe field of AI, now more than a half a century old, finally achieved some of its oldest goals. It began to be used successfully throughout the technology industry, although somewhat behind the scenes. Some of the success was due to increasing computer power and some was achieved by focusing on specific isolated problems and pursuing them with the highest standards of scientific accountability. Still, the reputation of AI, in the business world at least, was less than pristine. Inside the field there was little agreement on the reasons for AI's failure to fulfill the dream of human level intelligence that had captured the imagination of the world in the 1960s. Together, all these factors helped to fragment AI into competing subfields focused on particular problems or approaches, sometimes even under new names that disguised the tarnished pedigree of \"artificial intelligence\". AI was both more cautious and more successful than it had ever been.\n\nIn the first decades of the 21st century, access to large amounts of data (known as \"big data\"), cheaper and faster computers and advanced machine learning techniques were successfully applied to many problems throughout the economy. In fact, McKinsey Global Institute estimated in their famous paper \"Big data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity\" that \"by 2009, nearly all sectors in the US economy had at least an average of 200 terabytes of stored data\".\n\nBy 2016, the market for AI-related products, hardware, and software reached more than 8 billion dollars, and the New York Times reported that interest in AI had reached a \"frenzy\". The applications of big data began to reach into other fields as well, such as training models in ecology and for various applications in economics.

Audiophiles typically seek out gear capable of performing well in many or all of these areas, and it is often these elevated expectations that drive an audiophile\u2019s willingness to spend more. However, there are elements of subjectivity at play, as well as physiological differences, that can lead to variations in interpretation of what sounds \u201caccurate\u201d or \u201cengaging.\u201d Therefore, even if it is generally true that most expensive audio equipment objectively performs better than their lesser priced counterparts, individual preference and anatomy can cause differences in expectations or hearing that can lead to different perceptions of sonic performance, even with high-end audio gear.\n \nThe Erlkonig is an In-Ear Monitor made by German producer, Vision Ears.

While non-audiophiles will likely scoff at its price and be indifferent to the Erlkonig\u2019s specifications, many audiophiles will salivate at the chance for even a single listen. Even though many deep-pocketed audiophiles could justifiably purchase the Erlkonig, there are plenty of audiophiles and non-audiophiles who do not enjoy the IEM\u2019s sound.

Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.\u200a If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.", "response": "In engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC).

Conversely, stepping in the direction of the gradient will lead to a local maximum of that function; the procedure is then known as gradient ascent.\n\nGradient descent is generally attributed to Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who first suggested it in 1847.

Its convergence properties for non-linear optimization problems were first studied by Haskell Curry in 1944, with the method becoming increasingly well-studied and used in the following decades.", "response": "In mathematics,  gradient descent (also often called steepest descent) is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function.

The Canadian brigantine Dei Gratia found her in a dishevelled but seaworthy condition under partial sail and with her lifeboat missing. The last entry in her log was dated ten days earlier. She had left New York City for Genoa on November 7 and was still amply provisioned when found. Her cargo of alcohol was intact, and the captain's and crew's personal belongings were undisturbed. None of those who had been on board were ever seen or heard from again.\n\nMary Celeste was built in Spencer's Island, Nova Scotia, and launched under British registration as Amazon in 1861. She was transferred to American ownership and registration in 1868, when she acquired her new name. Thereafter she sailed uneventfully until her 1872 voyage. At the salvage hearings in Gibraltar following her recovery, the court's officers considered various possibilities of foul play, including mutiny by Mary Celeste's crew, piracy by the Dei Gratia crew or others, and conspiracy to carry out insurance or salvage fraud. No convincing evidence supported these theories, but unresolved suspicions led to a relatively low salvage award.\n\nThe inconclusive nature of the hearings fostered continued speculation as to the nature of the mystery, and the story has repeatedly been complicated by false detail and fantasy. Hypotheses that have been advanced include the effects on the crew of alcohol fumes rising from the cargo, submarine earthquakes, waterspouts, attack by a giant squid, and paranormal intervention.\n\nAfter the Gibraltar hearings, Mary Celeste continued in service under new owners. In 1885, her captain deliberately wrecked her off the coast of Haiti as part of an attempted insurance fraud. The story of her 1872 abandonment has been recounted and dramatized many times in documentaries, novels, plays, and films, and the name of the ship has become a byword for unexplained desertion. In 1884, Arthur Conan Doyle wrote \"J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement\", a short story based on the mystery, but spelled the vessel's name as Marie Celeste.

In all but a few situations the excavation is undertaken by a specialist floating plant, known as a dredger.\n\nDredging is carried out in many different locations and for many different purposes, but the main objectives are usually to recover material of value or use, or to create a greater depth of water. Dredges have been classified as suction or mechanical. Dredging systems can either be shore-based, brought to a location based on barges, or built into purpose built vessels.\n\nDredging has significant environmental impacts: it can disturb marine sediments, leading to both short- and long-term water pollution, destroy important seabed ecosystems, and can release legacy human-sourced toxins captured in the sediment. These environmental impacts can significantly hurt marine wildlife populations, contaminate sources of drinking water and interrupt economic activities such as fishing.", "response": "A dredger is a specialist floating plant used to do excavation of material from a water environment.

The Krebs cycle is used by organisms that respire (as opposed to organisms that ferment) to generate energy, either by anaerobic respiration or aerobic respiration. In addition, the cycle provides precursors of certain amino acids, as well as the reducing agent NADH, that are used in numerous other reactions. Its central importance to many biochemical pathways suggests that it was one of the earliest components of metabolism and may have originated abiogenically. Even though it is branded as a 'cycle', it is not necessary for metabolites to follow only one specific route; at least three alternative segments of the citric acid cycle have been recognized.\n\nThe name of this metabolic pathway is derived from the citric acid (a tricarboxylic acid, often called citrate, as the ionized form predominates at biological pH) that is consumed and then regenerated by this sequence of reactions to complete the cycle. The cycle consumes acetate (in the form of acetyl-CoA) and water, reduces NAD+ to NADH, releasing carbon dioxide. The NADH generated by the citric acid cycle is fed into the oxidative phosphorylation (electron transport) pathway. The net result of these two closely linked pathways is the oxidation of nutrients to produce usable chemical energy in the form of ATP.\n\nIn eukaryotic cells, the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion. In prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, which lack mitochondria, the citric acid cycle reaction sequence is performed in the cytosol with the proton gradient for ATP production being across the cell's surface (plasma membrane) rather than the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.\n\nFor each pyruvate molecule (from glycolysis), the overall yield of energy-containing compounds from the citric acid cycle is three NADH, one FADH2, and one GTP.", "response": "The citric acid cycle is used by organisms to generate energy.

What makes them round? Does there exist another shape?", "context": "", "response": "Not all planets and moons are round. There is some variety in their shapes depending on their masses, and curiously looking worlds might even exist, unlike anything we know from our system.\n\nEverything within a planet or a moon is under the influence of gravity in such a way that bits of it would move to the center if they could. Under ideal conditions, it would acquire a spherical shape. For objects made of something other than liquids, it varies at what point they become round. It is generally assumed that they mostly become spheres around 400 kilometers/248 miles in diameter when made from icy material commonly found in our Solar System. Still, if something is made from something more rigid, it needs to be larger in diameter than that - around 750 km/466 miles. At a sufficient mass, even rock becomes fluid-like. The moon of Mars Deimos is only 12.6 km/7.8 miles across and is not spherical, and there are many other small moons of other planets that don\u2019t have a round shape.\n\nThis, however, is not all. Astronomical objects spin, giving them the flattened shape of a sphere the faster their rotation if they are massive enough. On top of it, they can have moons. This causes a bulge to form at the position of their orbiting body around them. In the case of Earth, our Moon causes tides via this process. Also, our Sun gives our planet tides. Elsewhere in the Universe, there could be planets with massive moons or two similarly massive planets, called double planets, orbiting their common center of mass, the barycenter, at a close distance, which can cause even stronger bulging. Their shape would be affected this way more visibly.\n\nFinally, a bizarre, toroidal planet, shown above, can be stable from what we know from physics, at least for a while. As I mentioned earlier, even rigid rock behaves like a fluid at large masses. An adequate rotation speed can counterbalance the strength of gravity with centrifugal acceleration, and a torus-shaped planet could exist. A possible scenario for such a world to come to be would be if two sufficiently fast rotating planets collided and formed a doughnut of vaporized rock, a so-called synestia.\n\nWe currently think that the events that would lead to the formation of a world of this shape are so unlikely that there might not be a single toroidal planet in the Visible Universe, but we were quite a few times surprised by what we discovered during our exploration of Cosmos.

Because slavery ended over 150 years ago, \u201cmost institutions don\u2019t have good enough records to trace the actual descendants of slaves\u201d (Jones). The potential inaccuracy in identifying descendants could lead to overspending on reparations, potential accusations of fraud, and countless other complaints.\n\tResponsibility also plays a large role in determining if or how to distribute monetary reparations. While plantation owners are notoriously considered slave owners, \u201cthe Catholic Church was among the largest institutional slaveholders in the Americas\u201d (Jones). Other large corporations which took advantage of the American slave system include both insurance and railroad companies: \u201cInsurance companies sold policies on the lives of enslaved people (for their owners\u2019 profit, of course) or underwrote slaving voyages. Railroads used slave labor and profited from transporting cotton or rice produced by enslaved plantation workers\u201d (Jones). Given that both religious and industrial groups also had a rather large influence on the American slave system, the responsibility of the government to repay the descendants of slaves seems unreasonable. \nTo be able to pay the descendants of slaves, the government would also have to spend an excessive amount of money. Payment for slave labor requires adding up 24 hours, 365 days, for 246 years, plus inflation, the overall amount estimated to be upwards of $10 trillion. Even in smaller amounts \u201cseeding each account with $25,000 would cost the government $100 billion a year, equal to \u2018about 2% of federal expenditures now\u2019\u201d (Huddleston). Is that amount worth it? During his testimony, Beckett argued that money reparations are meaningless. Throwing money at a problem won\u2019t solve it: it won\u2019t end racism and it will cause the economy to plummet deeper in debt, creating more issues than it solves (Beckett). Not only would these reparations be a waste of taxpayer money, but it is understood that \u201cthe majority of Americans were not slave owners and even in the South, only one in five owned slaves,\u201d more convincingly, \u201cmany Americans today have no connection to slavery at all since they immigrated here after 1865\u201d (Source G). \nArguments could be made for the imbalance of reparations, as minorities such as Native American tribes have been given land and monetary reparations by the U.S. government. While these minorities have received reparations, these reparations directly to the victims. A table of previous reparations payments made to minorities/racially targeted groups that span from 1952-1990. The most recent and largest payment was in 1990, from the US government to Japanese American citizens, of $1.2 billion (about $20,000 each) in response to the Japanese encampments during World War II (Source D). While these payments were made to these minority groups, all these reparations were ordered while the original victims of the injustices were still alive, not over 150 years after the fact.\nThe complete dismissal of reparations, however, should not be administered. Focusing our attention on better ways to repay the descendants of slaves would be generally beneficial to the country, as Nathalie argued that descendants have no wealth. Given that a major source of wealth is inheritance, the lack of black property ownership means a less distinctive inheritance among black families for future generations (Nathalie). While reparations can be spent in the communities of descendants and underfunded black families, this affects people who may not be descendants, not specific to victims: \u201cRecipients of reparations should be \u2018the direct victims of the injustice or their immediate families\u2019\u201d (Source G). Despite this, former President Barack Obama stated that \u201cthe best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed,\u201d and that those reparations could potentially \u201ctake the form of government programs to help struggling people of all races\u201d (Source E). During her testimony, Michelle agreed, claiming that using reparations as a way of creating better schools and jobs for people who are struggling is a more beneficial way to use these monetary reparations (Michelle). Overall, the U.S. government, rather than distributing payments to individuals or communities, should focus on funding underprivileged or discriminated communities of traditionally black descendants, as this approach would create more opportunities and equality for discriminated black communities.", "category": "creative_writing"}, {"instruction": "Based on the provided information, when will we achieve AGI?", "context": "An artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a hypothetical intelligent agent which can understand or learn any intellectual task that human beings or other animals can.

If it's been in any accidents that may have impacted it's chassis at all. Later on when we're examining the car we may find evidence of damage or repair work, and it's good to know if the seller is lying to cover up any issues before we start negotiating price with them. Pulling the carfax can also be a good way to check if the seller is lying since it often contains detailed information about repair that has been performed to the car. If you notice that the seller is lying either after pulling the carfax or after inspecting the body, it's best not to purchase the car.\n\n* Ask the owner if they have any maintenance records. If they do, that not only means that the car has received the proper care but it also illustrates that the buyer is the kind of person that is very organized and likes to keep their processions in good condition, which is super important. That's the kind of person you want to be buying a car from. Also note that if the owner has been taking the car to the dealership or to an independent shop it's very easy to obtain these service records using the VIN number either online or by calling the mechanic directly.\n\n* Cars having a timing belt needs to be replaced every 70,000-100,000 miles. You can easily check if the car you're planning on purchasing has a timing belt or timing chain. Typically timing chains do not need to be replaced for the life of the car, so finding a car with a timing chain means that you have to worry less about this aspect. Depending on the car replacing the timing belt can be from 1,000 to 6,000 dollars so it's a pretty significant expense that you should take into account.\n\n* Ask how frequently the owner has been changing the oil. In most cases changing it every 3,000 to 6,000 or every year (whichever comes first) is ideal. Many owner manuals mention that you can go over this mileage. In some cases manuals mention oil change intervals of 10,000 or 20,000 miles. Personally, I would not consider a car that has its oil replaced this infrequently. In many cases, these longer intervals are an attempt by the manufacturer's marketing department  to make the car more appealing to buyers if it requires less maintenance. Also ask if they've been using synthetic oil. Typically synthetic oil doesn't break down over time so longer intervals might be ok.\n\n* Ask when was the last time brake pads and rotors have been replaced. Typically brake pads need to be replaced every 50000-100000 miles. Brake rotors can be trickier because whether or not needs replacing depends on its thickness, however if during the test drive you notice vibration when braking, it's likely due to the brake rotors. If the owner hasn't replaced the brakes recently there might be a good opportunity for negotiating the price.\n\n* If the car is a manual ask if the clutch has been replaced. This is a wear item and the time to replace it depends on the usage (cars driven in cities with a lot of stop and go traffic will need a replacement more frequently than cars driving long distances on the freeway).\n\n* For automatics ask when was the last time the transmission fluid was changed. Typically this needs to be replaced every 50-60k miles. Again many service manuals mention that the transmission fluid does not need to be replaced at all, but that's arguably again due to marketing reasons.\n\n* Examine the tires and note how much tread is on the tires. If you were to imagine putting a penny into the tire's tread, a new tire would take up 1/3 - 1/2 of the penny. Also tires need to be replaced every 5 years. The tire sidewall has a 4 digit number which shows the week and year it was manufactured, so it's easy to check if it's due for a replacement. Lastly check if the tires (especially the front) are worn evenly. If the interior part is more worn compared to the exterior, they might indicate suspension or alignment issues. So these issues will need to be addressed and the tires will need to be replaced to fix that problem.\n\n* Ask for and look for any interior problems, bulbs, gauges, AC, power windows not working, stuff like that.\n\n* Check for rust in the wheel wells and rocker panels. Stand back from the car and look for any slight differences in color between it's exterior panels that may indicate they were replaced, also look for dents. The best and easiest indication that a car was repaired or in an accident is if the gaps between body panels is uneven. A good way to identify body panel issues is by running your finger across a body panel, if you feel that one part of the body is lower than the other or if that gap is not consistent, this might mean that the car has been in an accident.\n\n* Look for any signs of fluids, greasy stains on metal, anything that would indicate that it's leaked something. Oil leaks would look dark and greasy. Battery leaks look white and powdery. Coolant leaks look dark and smell sweet. Look at the bottom of the hood, if there are any leak stains there too. Also looks underneath the engine for any greasy spots, because fluids always drip down.\n\n* Do some parts on the car look newer/cleaner than others? A new radiator could mean that the car was recently in a frontal collision.\n\n* Listen to the engine. Does it sound like it's keeping a constant RPM? You may hear some ticking caused by piston slapping or poorly lubricated valves. These are signs that the engine is old, but isn't that big of a deal. Grinding noises are very bad and expensive to fix. Older engines can be pretty noisy until they warm up which is normal.\n\n* Ask the owner to rev the engine while you look at it. Does the engine hop violently when it's revved? This might mean that the engine mounts might need to be replaced.\n\n* Again, ask the owner to rev the engine, this time look at the exhaust. If any blue smoke comes out, or (if it's a warm day outside) any dense white smoke comes out it may indicate that the engine is burning oil, and unless you like adding oil to your engine as often as you fill up your gas tank, it'll be expensive to fix.\n\nTime to take it for a test drive!\n\n* Look at the gauge cluster, is the check engine light on? Keep an eye on the temperature gauge during your trip, does it fluctuate at all? A good car's temperature stays constant during it's trip.\n\n* Take some sharp turns at speed and listen to any thumping or squeeking noises that may come from the suspension or drive train.\n\n* Does the steering wheel shake at all? (when driving it could mean bad alignment or bad steering, when braking it could mean warped rotors)\n\n* Make sure you take the car in and out of all it's gears.\n\n* Listen for funny noises, rattles, squeeks, clanks, vibrations, etc. It's inevitable that older cars will have some interior panels rattle.\n\n* Accelerate hard and brake hard. If the car has ABS does it activate or do you feel that the wheels stop moving?\n\n* Go over some speed bumps, or go on a bumpy road. The car shouldn't be bouncy when recovering from a bump, and neither should it feel like riding over a bump in a shopping cart. It should absorb the bump in a firm but smooth manner.\n\n* After driving for a while, pull over to the side of the road and turn off the car. Pop the hood and look at the coolant resevoir (DON'T OPEN IT!!!) and check if the fluid inside is bubbling or boiling. If it is then the headgasket is blown.\n\n* Remember when we asked the owner when they changed their oil? New oil should look like honey, old oil should have the same color as dark coffee (dark coffee color is a good thing). If the oil is brown or any other funky colors or smells funny something might be wrong with the engine.\n\n* Once you let the car rest for a few minutes check the oil level by using the dipstick if it's not all the way to full, it might be burning or leaking oil.", "category": "creative_writing"}, {"instruction": "Based on this paragraph, what is the diameter of a 10 F Foley catheter in mm?", "context": "The relative size of a Foley catheter is described using French units (F).

The adult-figured doll was exactly what Handler had in mind, so she purchased three of them. She gave one to her daughter and took the others back to Mattel. The Lilli doll was based on a popular character appearing in a comic strip drawn by Reinhard Beuthin for the newspaper Bild. Lilli was a blonde bombshell, a working girl who knew what she wanted and was not above using men to get it.

Cox's running mate on the Democratic Party's ticket in the 1920 United States presidential election, but Cox was defeated by Republican Warren G. Harding. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted a paralytic illness that permanently paralyzed his legs. He returned to public office by winning the 1928 New York gubernatorial election. He served as governor of New York from 1929 to 1933, promoting programs to combat the Great Depression besetting the United States at the time. In the 1932 presidential election, Roosevelt defeated Republican incumbent president Herbert Hoover in a landslide.\n\nDuring his first 100 days as president, Roosevelt spearheaded unprecedented federal legislation and issued a profusion of executive orders that instituted the New Deal. He created numerous programs to provide relief to the unemployed and farmers while seeking economic recovery with the National Recovery Administration and other programs. He also instituted major regulatory reforms related to finance, communications, and labor, and presided over the end of Prohibition. In 1936, Roosevelt won a landslide reelection with the economy having improved rapidly from 1933, but the economy relapsed into a deep recession in 1937 and 1938. Later, Roosevelt unsuccessfully sought passage of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937. The conservative coalition formed in 1937 to block the implementation of further New Deal programs and reforms. He ran successfully for reelection in 1940, becoming the only American president to serve for more than two terms.\n\nWith World War II looming after 1938 in addition to the Japanese invasion of China and the aggression of Nazi Germany, Roosevelt gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China as well as the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union while the United States remained officially neutral. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, he obtained a declaration of war on Japan the next day, and a few days later, on Germany and Italy. He worked closely with other national leaders in leading the Allies against the Axis powers. Roosevelt supervised the mobilization of the American economy to support the war effort and implemented a Europe first strategy. He also initiated the development of the world's first atomic bomb and worked with the other Allied leaders to lay the groundwork for the United Nations and other post-war institutions. He won reelection in 1944 but with his physical health seriously and steadily declining during the war years, he died in 1945.

Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), was a landmark decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that U.S. state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools are unconstitutional, even if the segregated schools are otherwise equal in quality. The decision partially overruled the Court's 1896 decision Plessy v. Ferguson, which had held that racial segregation laws did not violate the U.S. Constitution as long as the facilities for each race were equal in quality, a doctrine that had come to be known as \"separate but equal\".[note 1] The Court's decision in Brown paved the way for integration and was a major victory of the civil rights movement, and a model for many future impact litigation cases.\n\nThe underlying case began in 1951 when the public school system in Topeka, Kansas, refused to enroll local black resident Oliver Brown's daughter at the elementary school closest to their home, instead requiring her to ride a bus to a segregated black school farther away. The Browns and twelve other local black families in similar situations filed a class-action lawsuit in U.S. federal court against the Topeka Board of Education, alleging that its segregation policy was unconstitutional. A special three-judge court of the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas rendered a verdict against the Browns, relying on the precedent of Plessy v. Ferguson and its \"separate but equal\" doctrine. The Browns, represented by NAACP chief counsel Thurgood Marshall, then appealed the ruling directly to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn May 1954, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous 9\u20130 decision in favor of the Browns. The Court ruled that \"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal\", and therefore laws that impose them violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. However, the decision's 14 pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools, and the Court's second decision in Brown II (349 U.S. 294 (1955)) only ordered states to desegregate \"with all deliberate speed\".\n\nIn the Southern United States, especially the \"Deep South\", where racial segregation was deeply entrenched, the reaction to Brown among most white people was \"noisy and stubborn\". Many Southern governmental and political leaders embraced a plan known as \"Massive Resistance\", created by Virginia Senator Harry F. Byrd, in order to frustrate attempts to force them to de-segregate their school systems. Four years later, in the case of Cooper v.

The Tagore family was at the forefront of the Bengal renaissance. They hosted the publication of literary magazines; theatre and recitals of Bengali and Western classical music featured there regularly. Tagore's father invited several professional Dhrupad musicians to stay in the house and teach Indian classical music to the children. Tagore's oldest brother Dwijendranath was a philosopher and poet. Another brother, Satyendranath, was the first Indian appointed to the elite and formerly all-European Indian Civil Service. Yet another brother, Jyotirindranath, was a musician, composer, and playwright. His sister Swarnakumari became a novelist. Jyotirindranath's wife Kadambari Devi, slightly older than Tagore, was a dear friend and powerful influence.

In lead climbing the rope begins at the bottom attached to the climber as well as the belayer. The climber must then bring the rope from the bottom of the route to the top by clipping into a series of quick draws that are generally placed 10-15 feet apart. If a person were to fall while lead climbing, they would be caught by the last quick draw they clipped into. When top rope climbing, the rope is already at the top of the route. This means the climber must tie into one side of the rope while their belayer must clip into the other side of the rope. As the climber ascends higher up the route the belayer must take out the slack of the rope as opposed to lead climbing where the belayer would be giving slack. When a person falls in top rope climbing they will only fall a short distance as the rope is already clipped in above them at the top of the route, so how far they fall will be determined by how much slack the belayer has not taken in.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "What is a 4x4?", "context": "", "response": "A 4x4 is a type of vehicle with four wheel drive.

The trio were early employees of PayPal, which left them enriched after the company was bought by eBay. Hurley had studied design at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\n\nAccording to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party \"was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible\".\n\nKarim said the inspiration for YouTube first came from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, when Janet Jackson's breast was briefly exposed by Justin Timberlake during the halftime show. Karim could not easily find video clips of the incident and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami online, which led to the idea of a video-sharing site. Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not. They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a $100 reward. Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, with the site's founders deciding to accept uploads of any video.\n\n\nThe YouTube logo used from its launch until 2007; it returned in 2008 before being removed again in 2010. Another version of this logo without the \"Broadcast Yourself\" slogan was used until 2011.\nYouTube began as a venture capital\u2013funded technology startup. Between November 2005 and April 2006, the company raised money from various investors, with Sequoia Capital, $11.5 million, and Artis Capital Management, $8 million, being the largest two. YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California. In February 2005, the company activated www.youtube.com. The first video was uploaded April 23, 2005. Titled Me at the zoo, it shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the site. In May, the company launched a public beta and by November, a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million total views. The site launched officially on December 15, 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day. Clips at the time were limited to 100 megabytes, as little as 30 seconds of footage.\n\nYouTube was not the first video-sharing site on the Internet; Vimeo was launched in November 2004, though that site remained a side project of its developers from CollegeHumor at the time and did not grow much, either. The week of YouTube's launch, NBC-Universal's Saturday Night Live ran a skit \"Lazy Sunday\" by The Lonely Island. Besides helping to bolster ratings and long-term viewership for Saturday Night Live, \"Lazy Sunday\"'s status as an early viral video helped establish YouTube as an important website. Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than five million collective views by February 2006 before they were removed when NBCUniversal requested it two months later based on copyright concerns. Despite eventually being taken down, these duplicate uploads of the skit helped popularize YouTube's reach and led to the upload of more third-party content. The site grew rapidly; in July 2006, the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day.\n\nThe choice of the name www.youtube.com led to problems for a similarly named website, www.utube.com. That site's owner, Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment, filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November 2006 after being regularly overloaded by people looking for YouTube.

In the context of databases, a sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID properties (which can be perceived as a single logical operation on the data) is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction.\n\nIn 1983, Andreas Reuter and Theo H\u00e4rder coined the acronym ACID, building on earlier work by Jim Gray who named atomicity, consistency, and durability, but not isolation, when characterizing the transaction concept. These four properties are the major guarantees of the transaction paradigm, which has influenced many aspects of development in database systems.\n\nAccording to Gray and Reuter, the IBM Information Management System supported ACID transactions as early as 1973 (although the acronym was created later).\n\nAtomicity\nMain article: Atomicity (database systems)\nTransactions are often composed of multiple statements. Atomicity guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single \"unit\", which either succeeds completely or fails completely: if any of the statements constituting a transaction fails to complete, the entire transaction fails and the database is left unchanged. An atomic system must guarantee atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures, errors, and crashes. A guarantee of atomicity prevents updates to the database from occurring only partially, which can cause greater problems than rejecting the whole series outright. As a consequence, the transaction cannot be observed to be in progress by another database client. At one moment in time, it has not yet happened, and at the next, it has already occurred in whole (or nothing happened if the transaction was canceled in progress).\n\nConsistency\nMain article: Consistency (database systems)\nConsistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one consistent state to another, preserving database invariants: any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This prevents database corruption by an illegal transaction. Referential integrity guarantees the primary key\u2013foreign key relationship.\n\nIsolation\nMain article: Isolation (database systems)\nTransactions are often executed concurrently (e.g., multiple transactions reading and writing to a table at the same time). Isolation ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially. Isolation is the main goal of concurrency control; depending on the isolation level used, the effects of an incomplete transaction might not be visible to other transactions.\n\nDurability\nMain article: Durability (database systems)\nDurability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure (e.g., power outage or crash). This usually means that completed transactions (or their effects) are recorded in non-volatile memory.", "response": "ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.\nAtomicity means that actions occur either entirely or not at all; there is no partial write or situation where only part of an action was completed. For a database, this means that if data was written in a single transaction, that transaction either completes entirely or fails completely with no data left behind in a partial or corrupt state.\nConsistency means that transactions take the state from one valid state to another valid state, with no way to enter an invalid state.\nIsolation means that multiple readers/writers to the same database do not interfere with each other and can proceed without worrying about the effects of another action occurring.\nDurability means that state is preserved across failures and shutdowns, e.g. that state is persisted to permanent storage.", "category": "summarization"}, {"instruction": "Should we all use Qubes OS for most daily task that involve the internet?", "context": "Qubes implements a Security by Isolation approach.

The process of joining the alliance is governed by Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which allows for the invitation of \"other European States\" only and by subsequent agreements. Countries wishing to join must meet certain requirements and complete a multi-step process involving political dialog and military integration. The accession process is overseen by the North Atlantic Council, NATO's governing body. NATO was formed in 1949 with twelve founding members and has added new members nine times. The first additions were Greece and Turkey in 1952. In May 1955, West Germany joined NATO, which was one of the conditions agreed to as part of the end of the country's occupation by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, prompting the Soviet Union to form their own collective security alliance (commonly called the Warsaw Pact) later that month. Following the end of the Franco regime, newly-democratic Spain chose to join NATO in 1982.\n\nIn 1990, the negotiators reached an agreement that a reunified Germany would be in NATO under West Germany's existing membership. The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 led many former Warsaw Pact and post-Soviet states to initiate discussions about joining NATO. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic became NATO members in 1999, amid much debate within NATO itself and Russian opposition. NATO then formalized the process of joining the organization with \"Membership Action Plans\", which aided the accession of seven Central and Eastern Europe countries shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Two countries on the Adriatic Sea\u2014Albania and Croatia\u2014joined on 1 April 2009 before the 2009 Strasbourg\u2013Kehl summit. The next member states to join NATO were Montenegro on 5 June 2017, North Macedonia on 27 March 2020 and Finland on 4 April 2023.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine prompted Finland and Sweden to apply for NATO membership in May 2022, and the ratification process for Sweden is in progress. Finland officially joined on 4 April 2023. Ukraine applied for NATO membership in September 2022 after Russia claimed to annex part of its territory.

Glyn was commenting on a report underscoring the dilemma of rocketing house prices outstripping what locals could pay, with the report warning that \"...traditional Welsh communities could die out...\" as a consequence.\n\nIn 2001 nearly a third of all purchases of properties in Gwynedd were by buyers from out of the county, with some communities reporting as many as a third of local homes used as holiday homes. Holiday home owners typically spend less than six months of the year in the local community.\n\nThe issue of locals being priced out of the local housing market is common to many rural communities throughout Britain, but in Wales the added dimension of language further complicates the issue, as many new residents do not learn the Welsh language.\n\nConcerned for the Welsh language under these pressures, Glyn said \"Once you have more than 50% of anybody living in a community that speaks a foreign language, then you lose your indigenous tongue almost immediately\". His comments attracted strong criticism of Plaid Cymru from other national parties.\n\nBy spring 2002 both the Snowdonia National Park (Welsh: Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri) and Pembrokeshire Coast National Park (Welsh: Parc Cenedlaethol Arfordir Penfro) authorities began limiting second home ownership within the parks, following the example set by Exmoor.

Coffee later spread to the Levant and Persia in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learnt of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies. Coffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee. By 1852, globally, Brazil became the largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several other major producers, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999.

The American form of separation of powers is associated with a system of checks and balances.\n\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment, philosophers such as Montesquieu advocated the principle in their writings, whereas others, such as Thomas Hobbes, strongly opposed it. Montesquieu was one of the foremost supporters of separating the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. His writings considerably influenced the Founding Fathers of the United States, such as Alexander Hamilton, who participated in the Constitutional Convention of 1787 which drafted the Constitution.\n\nSome U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. The president of Delaware was a member of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as vice presidents.

This is due partly to their early cultivation in the Middle Eastern region known as the Fertile Crescent, made up by parts of modern Iran, Iraq, southwest Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and northern Egypt. Drying or dehydration also happened to be the earliest form of food preservation: grapes, dates, and figs that fell from the tree or vine would dry in the hot sun. Early hunter-gatherers observed that these fallen fruit took on an edible form, and valued them for their stability as well as their concentrated sweetness. \nThe earliest recorded mention of dried fruits can be found in Mesopotamian tablets dating to about 1500 BC, which contain what are probably the oldest known written recipes. These clay slabs, written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylonia, were inscribed in cuneiform and tell of diets based on grains (barley, millet, wheat), vegetables and fruits such as dates, figs, apples, pomegranates, and grapes. These early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners. They included dried fruits in their breads for which they had more than 300 recipes, from simple barley bread for the workers to very elaborate, spiced cakes with honey for the palaces and temples.\nThe date palm was one of the first cultivated trees. It was domesticated in Mesopotamia more than 5,000 years ago. It grew abundantly in the Fertile Crescent and it was so productive (an average date palm produces 50 kg (100 lbs) of fruit a year for 60 years or more) that dates were the cheapest of staple foods. Because they were so valuable, they were well recorded in Assyrian and Babylonian monuments and temples. The villagers in Mesopotamia dried them and ate them as sweets. Whether fresh, soft-dried or hard-dried, they helped to give character to meat dishes and grain pies. They were valued by travelers for their energy and were recommended as stimulants against fatigue.\nFigs were also prized in early Mesopotamia, Palestine, Israel, and Egypt where their daily use was probably greater than or equal to that of dates. As well as appearing in wall paintings, many specimens have been found in Egyptian tombs as funerary offerings. In Greece and Crete, figs grew very readily and they were the staple of poor and rich alike, particularly in their dried form.\nGrape cultivation first began in Armenia and the eastern regions of the Mediterranean in the 4th century BC. Raisins were produced by drying grapes in the hot desert sun. Very quickly, viticulture and raisin production spread across northern Africa including Morocco and Tunisia. The Phoenicians and the Egyptians popularized the production of raisins, probably due to the perfect arid environment for sun drying. They put them in jars for storage and allotted them to the different temples by the thousands. They also added them to breads and various pastries, some made with honey, some with milk and eggs.\nFrom the Middle East, these fruits spread through Greece to Italy where they became a major part of the diet. Ancient Romans consumed raisins in spectacular quantities and at all levels of society, including them as a key part of their common meals, along with olives and fresh fruits. Raisined breads were common for breakfast and were consumed with their grains, beans, and cultured milks. Raisins were so valued that they transcended the food realm and became rewards for successful athletes, as well as premium barter currency.\nHaving dried fruits was essential in ancient Rome as these instructions for housekeepers around 100 BC tell: \"She must keep a supply of cooked food on hand for you and the servants. She must keep many hens and have plenty of eggs. She must have a large store of dried pears, sorbs, figs, raisins, sorbs in must, preserved pears and grapes and quinces. She must also keep preserved grapes in grape-pulp and in pots buried in the ground, as well as fresh Praenestine nuts kept in the same way, and Scantian quinces in jars, and other fruits that are usually preserved, as well as wild fruits. All these she must store away diligently every year.\"\nFigs were also extremely popular in Rome. Dried figs were added to bread and formed a major part of the winter food of country people. They were rubbed with spices such as cumin, anise and fennel seeds, or toasted sesame, wrapped in fig leaves and stored in jars. Today, major producing regions include Israel, Jerusalem, Gaza and many other Arabic countries. Dried figs are rich in vitamins, phosphorus and various other important minerals.\nPlums, apricots and peaches had their origins in Asia. They were domesticated in China in the 3rd millennium BC and spread to the Fertile Crescent where they were also very popular, fresh and dried alike. They arrived in Greece and Italy much later and were very expensive but valued in the preparation of gourmet dishes with port or stewed with honey and spices.", "response": "The date palm was one of the first cultivated trees.

Because they were so valuable, they were well recorded in Assyrian and Babylonian monuments and temples. The villagers in Mesopotamia dried them and ate them as sweets.

In 1984, a prequel, The Temple of Doom, was released, and in 1989, a sequel, The Last Crusade. A fourth film followed in 2008, titled The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A fifth and final film, titled The Dial of Destiny, is in production and is scheduled to be released in 2023. The series was created by George Lucas and stars Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. The first four films were directed by Steven Spielberg, who worked closely with Lucas during their production.\n\nIn 1992, the franchise expanded to a television series with The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, portraying the character in his childhood and youth, and including adventures with his parents.\n\nMarvel Comics began publishing The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones in 1983, and Dark Horse Comics gained the comic book rights to the character in 1991. Novelizations of the films have been published, as well as many novels with original adventures, including a series of German novels by Wolfgang Hohlbein, twelve novels set before the films published by Bantam Books, and a series set during the character's childhood inspired by the television show.\n\nNumerous Indiana Jones video games have been released since 1982.\n\nBackground\nDuring 1973, George Lucas wrote The Adventures of Indiana Smith. Like Star Wars, it was an opportunity to create a modern version of the movie serials of the 1930s and 1940s. Lucas discussed the concept with Philip Kaufman, who worked with him for several weeks and decided upon the Ark of the Covenant as the MacGuffin. The project was stalled when Clint Eastwood hired Kaufman to write The Outlaw Josey Wales. In May 1977, Lucas was in Maui, trying to escape the worldwide success of Star Wars. His friend and colleague Steven Spielberg was also there, on vacation from work on Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Spielberg told Lucas he was interested in making a James Bond film, but Lucas told him of an idea \"better than James Bond\", outlining the plot of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Spielberg loved it, calling it \"a James Bond film without the hardware\", and had the character's surname changed to Jones. Spielberg and Lucas made a deal with Paramount Pictures for five Indiana Jones films.\n\nSpielberg and Lucas aimed to make Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom much darker, because of their personal moods following their respective breakups and divorces. Lucas made the film a prequel as he did not want the Nazis to be the villains again. He had ideas regarding the Monkey King and a haunted castle, but eventually created the Sankara Stones, that would be used in the film. He hired Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz to write the script as he knew of their interest in Indian culture. The major scenes that were dropped from Raiders of the Lost Ark were included in this film: an escape using a giant rolling gong as a shield, a fall out of a plane in a raft, and a mine cart chase. For the third film, Spielberg revisited the Monkey King and haunted castle concepts, before Lucas suggested the Holy Grail. Spielberg had previously rejected this as too ethereal, but then devised a father-son story and decided that \"The Grail that everybody seeks could be a metaphor for a son seeking reconciliation with a father and a father seeking reconciliation with a son.\"\n\nFollowing the 1989 release of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Lucas let the series end as he felt he could not think of a good plot device to drive the next installment and chose instead to produce The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, which explored the character in his early years. Ford played Indiana in one episode, narrating his adventures in 1920 Chicago. When Lucas shot Ford's role in December 1992, he realized that the scene opened up the possibility of a film with an older Indiana set in the 1950s. The film could reflect a science fiction 1950s B-movie, with aliens as the plot device. Ford disliked the new angle, telling Lucas: \"No way am I being in a Steven Spielberg movie like that.\" Spielberg himself, who depicted aliens in Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, resisted it. Lucas devised a story, which Jeb Stuart turned into a script from October 1993 to May 1994. Lucas wanted Indiana to get married, which would allow Henry Jones Sr. to return, expressing concern over whether his son is happy with what he has accomplished. After learning that Joseph Stalin was interested in psychic warfare, Lucas decided to have Russians as the villains and the aliens to have psychic powers. Following Stuart's next draft, Lucas hired Last Crusade writer Jeffrey Boam to write the next three versions, the last of which was completed in March 1996. Three months later, Independence Day was released, and Spielberg told Lucas he would not make another alien invasion film (or at least not until War of the Worlds in 2005). Lucas decided to focus on the Star Wars prequels instead.\n\nIn 2000, Spielberg's son asked when the next Indiana Jones film would be released, which made him interested in reviving the project. The same year, Ford, Lucas, Spielberg, Frank Marshall, and Kathleen Kennedy met during the American Film Institute's tribute to Ford, and decided they wanted to enjoy the experience of making an Indiana Jones film again. Spielberg also found returning to the series a respite from his many dark films during this period. Spielberg and Lucas discussed the central idea of a B-movie involving aliens, and Lucas suggested using crystal skulls to ground the idea. Lucas found these artifacts as fascinating as the Ark, and had intended to feature them for a Young Indiana Jones episode before the show's cancellation. M. Night Shyamalan was hired to write for an intended 2002 shoot, but he was overwhelmed by the task, and claimed it was difficult to get Ford, Spielberg, and Lucas to focus. Stephen Gaghan and Tom Stoppard were also approached.\n\nFrank Darabont, who wrote various Young Indiana Jones episodes, was hired to write in May 2002. His script, titled Indiana Jones and the City of Gods, was set in the 1950s, with ex-Nazis pursuing Jones. Spielberg conceived the idea because of real-life figures such as Juan Per\u00f3n in Argentina, who allegedly protected Nazi war criminals. Darabont claimed Spielberg loved the script, but Lucas had issues with it, and decided to take over writing himself. Lucas and Spielberg acknowledged that the 1950s setting could not ignore the Cold War, and the Russians were more plausible villains. Spielberg decided he could not satirize the Nazis after directing Schindler's List, while Ford felt \"We plum wore the Nazis out.\" Darabont's main contribution was reintroducing Marion Ravenwood as Indiana's love interest, but he gave them a 13-year-old daughter, which Spielberg decided was too similar to The Lost World: Jurassic Park.\n\nJeff Nathanson met with Spielberg and Lucas in August 2004, and turned in the next drafts in October and November 2005, titled The Atomic Ants. David Koepp continued on from there, giving his script the subtitle Destroyer of Worlds, based on the J. Robert Oppenheimer quote. It was changed to Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, as Spielberg found this a more inviting title which actually named the plot device. Koepp wanted to depict the character of Mutt as a nerd, but Lucas refused, explaining he had to resemble Marlon Brando in The Wild One; \"he needs to be what Indiana Jones's father thought of  \u2013 the curse returns in the form of his own son \u2013 he's everything a father can't stand\". Koepp collaborated with Lawrence Kasdan on the film's \"love dialogue\".\n\nThe Walt Disney Company has owned the Indiana Jones intellectual property since its acquisition of Lucasfilm, the series' production company, in 2012, when Lucas sold it for $4 billion. Walt Disney Studios owns the distribution and marketing rights to future Indiana Jones films since 2013, with Paramount retaining the distribution rights to the first four films and receiving \"financial participation\" from any additional films. Disney will distribute the fifth film Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which will be directed by James Mangold and produced by Spielberg.\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark (1981)\nMain article: Raiders of the Lost Ark\nThe first film is set in 1936. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is hired by government agents to locate the Ark of the Covenant, the gold plated chest containing the stone tablets Moses used to inscribe the Ten Commandments before the Nazi Germans steal it for themselves. The Nazis have teams searching for religious artefacts, including the Ark, which is rumored to make an army that carries the Ark before it invincible. The Nazis are being helped by Indiana's arch-rival and French archaeologist Ren\u00e9 Belloq (Paul Freeman). With the help of his former lover and tough bar owner Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and his excavator friend Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), Indiana manages to recover the Ark in Egypt. The Nazis steal the Ark and capture Indiana and Marion. Belloq and the Nazis perform a ceremony to open the Ark, but when they do so, all they find inside is sand. Suddenly, spirits come out of the Ark and the Nazis are all killed by the Ark's wrath. Indiana and Marion, who survived by closing their eyes, manage to get the Ark to the United States, where it is stored in a secret government warehouse.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)\nMain article: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\nThe second film is a prequel set in 1935, a year before Raiders of the Lost Ark. Indiana escapes Chinese gangsters led by Lao Che with the help of singer/actress Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and his twelve-year-old sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan). The trio crash-land in India, where they come across a Punjabi village whose children have been kidnapped. The Thuggee cult led by Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) has also taken the holy Sankara Stones, which they will use to take over the world. Indiana manages to overcome Mola Ram's evil power, rescues the children and returns the stones to their rightful place, overcoming his own mercenary nature. The film has been noted as an outlier in the franchise, as it does not feature Indy's university or any antagonistic political entity, and is less focused on archaeology, being presented as a dark movie with gross-out elements, human sacrifice and torture.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)\nMain article: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\nThe third film is set in 1938. Indiana and his friend Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) are assigned by American businessman Walter Donovan (Julian Glover) to find the Holy Grail. They are teamed up with Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), following on from where Indiana's estranged father Henry (Sean Connery) left off before he disappeared. It transpires that Donovan and Elsa are in league with the Nazis, who captured Henry Jones in order to get Indiana to help them find the Grail. However, Indiana recovers his father's diary filled with his research, and manages to rescue him before finding the location of the Grail. Both Donovan and Elsa fall to the temptation of the Grail, while Indiana and Henry realize that their relationship with each other is more important than finding the relic.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)\nMain article: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\nThe fourth film is set in 1957, nineteen years after The Last Crusade. Indiana is having a quiet life teaching before being thrust into a new adventure. He races against agents of the Soviet Union, led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) for a crystal skull. His journey takes him across Nevada, Connecticut, Peru, and the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. Indiana is faced with betrayal by one of his best friends, Mac (Ray Winstone), is introduced to a greaser named Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), who turns out to be his son (his real name revealed to be Henry Jones III), and is reunited with, and eventually marries, Marion Ravenwood, who was the lead female character introduced in the first movie.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023)\nMain article: Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\nA fifth film, set in 1969, is scheduled for release on June 30, 2023.

Principal photography began in October 1973 and wrapped up in June 1974. The Godfather Part II premiered in New York City on December 12, 1974, and was released in the United States on December 20, 1974, receiving divided reviews from critics; its reputation, however, improved rapidly, and it soon became the subject of critical re-appraisal. It grossed $48 million in the United States and Canada and up to $93 million worldwide on a $13 million budget. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, and became the first sequel to win Best Picture. Its six Oscar wins also included Best Director for Coppola, Best Supporting Actor for De Niro and Best Adapted Screenplay for Coppola and Puzo. Pacino won Best Actor at the BAFTAs and was nominated at the Oscars.\n\nLike its predecessor, Part II remains a highly influential film, especially in the gangster genre. It is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, as well as the rare example of a sequel that may be superior to its predecessor. In 1997, the American Film Institute ranked it as the 32nd-greatest film in American film history and it retained this position 10 years later. It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1993, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".

His main accomplishments as a junior player came at Wimbledon in 1998 when he won both the boys' singles final over Irakli Labadze, and in doubles teamed with Olivier Rochus defeating the team of Micha\u00ebl Llodra and Andy Ram. In addition he reached the US Open Junior final in 1998, losing to David Nalbandian. Federer won four ITF junior singles tournaments in his career, including the prestigious Orange Bowl, where he defeated Guillermo Coria in the final. By the end of 1998 he attained the No. 1 junior world ranking and was awarded ITF junior World Champion. He ended his junior career at the end of 1998 with a high-ranking of No. 1 in singles and No. 7 in doubles (both attained on December 31, 1998) and a win\u2013loss record of 78\u201320 in singles and 36\u201321 in doubles.\n\nJunior Grand Slam results \u2013 Singles:\n\nAustralian Open: SF (1998)\nFrench Open: 1R (1998)\nWimbledon: W (1998)\nUS Open: F (1998)\n\nJunior Grand Slam results \u2013 Doubles:\n\nAustralian Open: SF (1998)\nFrench Open: 1R (1998)\nWimbledon: W (1998)\nUS Open: 1R (1998)\n\n1998\u20132002: Early professional career\nMain article: Roger Federer's early career\nFederer made his ATP debut at the 1998 Swiss Open Gstaad in his home country of Switzerland losing to Lucas Arnold Ker in the first round. Later that year, he won his first ATP match in Toulouse against Guillaume Raoux. He got a wildcard into the 1998 Swiss Indoors and lost in the first round to 4th seed and former world number 1 Andre Agassi. Federer finished his career as a 10-time champion of the tournament.\n\nFederer entered the top 100 ranking for the first time on 20 September 1999 and started at the 1999 Marseille Open defeating the reigning champion of the 1998 French Open, Spaniard Carlos Moy\u00e1. His first final came at the Marseille Open in 2000, where he lost to fellow Swiss Marc Rosset. Federer won the 2001 Hopman Cup representing Switzerland, along with world No. 1 Martina Hingis. The duo defeated the American pair of Monica Seles and Jan-Michael Gambill in the finals. Federer later said that his experience with Hingis \"definitely helped me to become the player I am today.\"\n\nFederer's first singles win was at the 2001 Milan Indoor tournament, where he defeated Julien Boutter in the final. Although he won his first title already in 1999 on the Challenger tour, winning the doubles event in Segovia, Spain with Dutchman Sander Groen, the final was played on Federer's 18th birthday. In 2001, Federer made his first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the French Open, losing to former world No. 2 and eventual finalist \u00c0lex Corretja. His run to the French quarterfinals launched him into the top 15 for the first time in his career.\n\nHis international breakthrough came at the 2001 Wimbledon Championships, when the 19-year-old Federer faced the four-time defending champion and all-time Grand Slam leader Pete Sampras. Federer beat the No. 1 seed in a five-set match to reach the quarterfinals. In the quarters he faced Englishman Tim Henman, eventually losing in a fourth-set tiebreaker.\n\nThe first final he reached at the Masters level came at the 2002 Miami Masters event, where he lost to former and future No. 1 Andre Agassi on hard court. Federer won his first Master Series event at the 2002 Hamburg Masters on clay, over Marat Safin; the victory put him in the top 10 for the first time. Federer made 10 singles finals between 1998 and 2002, of which he won four and lost six. He also made six finals in doubles. He finished 2001 with an ATP ranking of No. 13, and 2002 was the first year he was ranked within the top 10, finishing at No. 6.\n\n2003: Grand Slam breakthrough at Wimbledon\nMain article: 2003 Roger Federer tennis season\nIn 2003, Federer won his first Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon, beating Andy Roddick in the semifinals and Mark Philippoussis in the final. In August he had a chance to take over the No. 1 ranking for the first time from Andre Agassi if he made it to the Montreal final. However, he fell in the semifinals to Roddick, in a final-set tiebreaker, leaving him 120 points behind Agassi. This, coupled with early losses to David Nalbandian at Cincinnati and the US Open, denied Federer the chance to become No. 1 for the duration of the season.\n\nFederer won his first and only doubles Masters event in Miami with Max Mirnyi and made it to one singles Masters event in Rome on clay, which he lost. Federer made it to nine finals on the ATP Tour and won seven of them, including the 500 series events at Dubai and Vienna. Lastly, Federer won the year-end championships over Andre Agassi, finishing the year as world No. 2, narrowly behind Andy Roddick by only 160 points.\n\n2004: Imposing dominance\nMain article: 2004 Roger Federer tennis season\nDuring 2004 Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles and became the first person to do in one season so since Mats Wilander in 1988. His first major hard-court title came at the Australian Open over Marat Safin, making him the world No. 1 for the first time. He then won his second Wimbledon crown over Andy Roddick. At the US Open, Federer defeated the 2001 champion, Lleyton Hewitt, for his first title there.\n\nFederer won three ATP Masters events, one on clay in Hamburg, and the other two on hard surfaces at Indian Wells and in Canada. Federer took the ATP 500 series event at Dubai and wrapped up the year by winning the year-end championships for the second time. He also won his first tournament on home soil by capturing the Swiss Open in Gstaad. His 11 singles titles were the most of any player in two decades, and his record of 74\u20136 was the best since Ivan Lendl in 1986. He reached the year-end No. 1 ranking for the first time.\n\n2005: Consolidating dominance\nMain article: 2005 Roger Federer tennis season\nIn 2005, Federer failed to reach the finals of the first two Grand Slam tournaments, losing the Australian Open semifinal to eventual champion Safin after holding match points, and the French Open semifinal to eventual champion Rafael Nadal. However, Federer reestablished his dominance on grass, winning Wimbledon for a third time by defeating Andy Roddick. At the US Open, Federer defeated Andre Agassi in the latter's last major final.\n\nFederer also took four Masters wins: Indian Wells, Miami and Cincinnati on hard court, and Hamburg on clay. The win in Miami was particularly noteworthy as it was the first final contested between Federer and Nadal. Federer recovered from two sets and a break down to take the final in five sets. Furthermore, Federer won two ATP 500 series events at Rotterdam and Dubai. Federer lost the year-end championships to David Nalbandian in five sets while playing through a foot injury that sidelined him for almost the rest of the season after September. He maintained his position as No. 1 for the entire season.\n\nFederer won 11 singles titles, which ties his 2004 season. Federer's 81 match victories were the most since Pete Sampras in 1993, and his record of 81\u20134 (95.2%) remains the third-best winning percentage in the Open Era behind John McEnroe's 1984 and Jimmy Connors's 1974.\n\n2006: Career-best season\nMain article: 2006 Roger Federer tennis season\nThe 2006 season was statistically the best season of Federer's career. In November 2011, Stephen Tignor, chief editorial writer for Tennis.com, ranked Federer's 2006 season as statistically the second-best season of all time during the Open Era, behind Rod Laver's Grand Slam year of 1969.\n\n\nFederer hits a forehand at the 2006 US Open, where he became the first man in history to achieve the Wimbledon-US Open double for three consecutive seasons.\nFederer won 12 singles titles (the most of any player since Thomas Muster in 1995 and John McEnroe in 1984) and had a match record of 92\u20135 (the most wins since Ivan Lendl in 1982). Federer reached the finals in an astounding 16 of the 17 tournaments he entered during the season.\n\nIn 2006, Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles and reached the final of the other, with the only loss coming against Nadal in the French Open. This was Federer and Nadal's first meeting in a Grand Slam final. He was the first man to reach all four finals in a calendar year since Rod Laver in 1969. Federer defeated Nadal in the Wimbledon Championships final. In the Australian Open, Federer defeated Marcos Baghdatis, and at the US Open, Federer defeated 2003 champion Roddick. In addition, Federer reached six Masters finals, winning four on hard surfaces and losing two on clay to Nadal. Federer, however, consistently pushed Nadal to the limit on clay throughout the season taking him to fourth-set tiebreakers in Monte-Carlo and Paris, and a thrilling match in Rome that went to a deciding fifth-set tiebreaker.\n\nFederer won one ATP 500 series event in Tokyo and captured the year-end championships for the third time in his career, again finishing the year as world No. 1. Federer only lost to two players during 2006, to Nadal four times in finals, and to 19-year-old Andy Murray in the second round of the 2006 Cincinnati Masters, in what was Federer's only defeat before the final of a tournament that year. Federer finished the season on a 29-match winning streak, as well as winning 48 of his last 49 matches after the French Open.\n\nNear the end of the season he won his hometown tournament, the Swiss Indoors in Basel, Switzerland for the first time, having finished runner up in 2000 and 2001, and missing the tournament in 2004 and 2005 due to injuries.\n\n2007: Holding off young rivals\nMain article: 2007 Roger Federer tennis season\nIn 2007, Federer reached all four Grand Slam singles finals, winning three of them again. He won the Australian Open without dropping a set, beating Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez in the final. This made him the first man in the 21st century to accomplish the feat, as Bj\u00f6rn Borg at the 1980 French Open was the last to win a Grand Slam tournament without the loss of a set. Federer had entered the year on a huge winning streak and after capturing his fourth Dubai crown Federer's winning streak stood at 41 matches, the longest of his career and only five shy of the record. Federer entered Indian Wells as the three-time defending champion, but his streak ended in controversy. He was defeated by an Argentine, Guillermo Ca\u00f1as, who had failed a drug test for illegal doping.\n\n\nFederer was called \"Darth Federer\" by fans and commentators at the 2007 US Open.\nThis surprising first-round loss marked the first time he was defeated since August 2006, a period spanning over 7 months.\n\nDuring the clay season Federer's victory in the Hamburg Masters final was particularly impressive, as it snapped Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-era record. Federer turned the match around from a set down to sweep 12 of the final 14 games, including a final set bagel. At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer could become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in a repeat of the previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was undone by going 1/17 on break-point chances.\n\nAt Wimbledon Federer entered the tournament not only as the four-time defending champion, but also riding a 48-match winning streak on grass. Once again, he defeated Rafael Nadal for a second consecutive year in the final, this time in a thrilling five-set encounter that many analysts hailed as the greatest Wimbledon final since 1980. Victory at Wimbledon equaled him with Bj\u00f6rn Borg for the record of five consecutive championships at the All England Club.\n\nFederer reached the final in Montreal before playing a young and relatively unknown Serbian named Novak Djokovic. Djokovic proved his potential by beating the world No. 1 in a final-set tiebreaker upset. Federer rebounded in Cincinnati to capture his fifth title of the year. Federer entered the US Open as the three-time defending champion and faced Djokovic in the final. This time, Federer prevailed in a close straight-set match. Victory in New York moved him ahead of Laver and Borg for third on the all-time list of major championship victories. Throughout the tournament the American press nicknamed him Darth Federer for his all-black attire (which included tuxedo-striped shorts) and the tournament played \"The Imperial March\" from Star Wars when he was announced onto the court for each of his matches. He closed out the year with victories in Basel and the year-end championships in Shanghai.\n\nHe finished the season as the year-end No. 1 for the fourth year in a row, demonstrating his dominance, and during these four years he won 11 Grand Slam singles titles. After his phenomenal triple Grand Slam season yet again, Federer became the only player in history to win three majors in a year for three years (2004, 2006, 2007). It was the third consecutive season that Federer held the No. 1 ranking for all 52 weeks of the year.\n\n2008: Illness, Olympic Gold, and fifth US Open\nMain article: 2008 Roger Federer tennis season\nFederer's success in 2008 was severely hampered by a lingering bout of mononucleosis, which he suffered during the first half of the year. At the end of the year he suffered a back injury.\n\nIn 2008, Federer captured one Grand Slam, a singles title at the US Open over Andy Murray. Federer was defeated by Nadal in two Grand Slam finals, the French Open and Wimbledon, which was regarded as the best match of tennis history by many, when he was going for six straight wins to break Bj\u00f6rn Borg's record. He came back from two sets down to force a fifth set, where he fell just two points from the title. At the Australian Open Federer lost in the semifinals to eventual winner Djokovic, which ended his record of 10 consecutive finals. He lost twice in Masters finals on clay to Nadal, at Monte Carlo and Hamburg. Federer captured three titles playing in 250-level events at Estoril, Halle, and Basel.\n\nAt the Olympic Games Federer and Stan Wawrinka won the gold medal in doubles, after beating the Bryan brothers American team in the semifinals and the Swedish duo of Simon Aspelin and Thomas Johansson in the final. However, Federer could reach only the quarterfinals in the singles draw, bowing out to then No. 8 James Blake, ceding his No. 1 ranking to Nadal after being at the top for a record 237 consecutive weeks. He ended the year ranked No. 2.\n\nFederer entered the 2009 season with 13 Grand Slams, only one behind Pete Sampras' all-time record. The season began with a loss to Nadal in the final of the Australian Open in a hotly contested five-set match. Federer struggled following the defeat in Melbourne and entered the clay season without a title.\n\n\nFederer winning the 2009 French Open, and completing the career Grand Slam\nFederer's season turned around in the final Masters event of the clay season when he defeated Nadal on clay for only the second time to capture the Madrid Masters. Federer entered the French Open with few predicting him to win the elusive Parisian title having lost to Nadal in the final weekend for the past four seasons. After Nadal's unexpected defeat to Robin S\u00f6derling, Federer became the overwhelming favorite. In his next match, he came from two sets and break point down in the third set to defeat Tommy Haas in five sets. He also fought back from a two-sets-to-one deficit against a young Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro to win a five setter in the semifinals. In the final, he faced S\u00f6derling, and with straight sets victory, he finally captured the Coupe des Mousquetaires and career Grand Slam. This victory also tied him with Pete Sampras for the most Grand Slam singles titles.\n\nFederer turned his sights to the grass courts of Wimbledon, where he breezed his way up to the final. In the championship match he faced long-time rival Andy Roddick in what was their eighth and final meeting at a Grand Slam. Roddick pushed Federer into a record-setting fifth set, which Federer claimed 16\u201314 to win his 15th Grand Slam singles title, breaking the all-time record of Pete Sampras.\n\nFederer continued his summer run by winning his third title on the lightning-fast courts of the Cincinnati Masters, defeating Novak Djokovic in the final. At the US Open he defeated S\u00f6derling in the quarters and Djokovic, for the third consecutive year, in the semifinals. On the penultimate point of the Djokovic match he hit what many consider to be the greatest shot of his career, a tweener winner, to set up match points. Federer was defeated by del Potro in the final despite leading two sets to one and falling just two points from the title in the fourth set.\n\nThe 2009 season was perhaps the most historically relevant of Federer's career as he completed a career Grand Slam by winning his first French Open title and won a men's record fifteenth Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon, surpassing Pete Sampras's mark of fourteen. The Wimbledon final was also historic for being the longest Grand Slam final in terms of games played with Federer prevailing 16\u201314 in the fifth set.\n\nFederer finished the season as the year-end No. 1 for the fifth time in his career.\n\n2010: Fourth Australian Open\nMain article: 2010 Roger Federer tennis season\n\nFederer won a record 16th major at the 2010 Australian Open.\nFederer started the year with a win at the Australian Open, where he defeated Andy Murray in the final, extending the Grand Slam singles record to sixteen titles and matching Andre Agassi's record of four Australian Open titles. Since Wimbledon 2005 Federer had made 18 out of 19 finals in Grand Slam tournaments, a period of sustained excellence unparalleled in the Open Era. This tournament, however, marked the end of his dominance at the majors.\n\nAt the French Open, Federer won his 700th tour match and 150th tour match on clay. However, he failed to reach a Grand Slam semifinal for the first time since the 2004 French Open, losing to S\u00f6derling in the last 8 and relinquishing his No. 1 ranking, having been just one week away from equaling Pete Sampras's record of 286 weeks as world No. 1. In a huge upset at Wimbledon, Federer lost in the last 8 again to Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych and fell to No. 3 in the rankings for the first time in 6 years and 8 months.\n\nTowards the middle of July, Federer hired Pete Sampras' old coach Paul Annacone on a trial basis to put his tennis game and career back on track. At the 2010 US Open Federer reached the semifinals, where he lost a five-set match to Novak Djokovic after holding two match points. Federer made it to four Masters finals prevailing against Mardy Fish at the Cincinnati Masters.\n\nFederer finished the year in strong form, winning indoor titles at the Stockholm Open, Swiss Indoors, and the ATP Finals in London bringing his tally to 66 career titles. Federer won the year-end championships in London by beating rival Rafael Nadal for his fifth title at the event. He beat all contenders except Nadal in straight sets. It remains the only tournament in his career where Federer defeated all fellow members of the Big Four. In 2010 Federer finished in the top two for the eighth consecutive season.\n\n2011: Tour Finals title record\nMain article: 2011 Roger Federer tennis season\nThe year 2011 was a lean year for Federer, although great by most player's standards. He was defeated in straight sets in the semifinals of the 2011 Australian Open by eventual champion Novak Djokovic, marking the first time since July 2003 that he did not hold any of the four major titles. In the French Open semifinals, Federer ended Djokovic's undefeated streak of 43 consecutive wins with a four-set victory. Federer then lost in the final to Rafael Nadal. At Wimbledon Federer advanced to his 29th consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. It marked the first time in his career that he had lost a Grand Slam tournament match after winning the first two sets.\n\nAt the US Open Federer lost in the semifinals to Novak Djokovic in five sets. In a repeat of previous year's semifinal event, Federer again squandered two match points on his own serve before losing after winning first two sets for second consecutive time in the year. The loss meant that it was the first time since 2002 that Federer had not won any of the four grand slam titles.\n\nIn September 2011, in a South African poll, Federer was voted the second most trusted and respected person in the world next to Nelson Mandela.\n\nFederer finished the season successfully in the indoor season, winning his last three tournaments of the year at the Swiss Indoors, Paris Masters, and ATP Finals, forming a 16 match winning streak.

Instructional designers typically establish learning objectives in partnership with stakeholders, then write content based on the learning objectives. Usually, these learning objectives are skills-based and rely on an instructional designer's expertise to appropriately level the content and create activities based on task, skill and gap analysis. The content and activities created by an instructional designer is documented inside of a storyboard. The elearning developer then takes the storyboard and creates an interactive learning experience in software like Storyline 360 or Adobe Captivate. They carefully read the storyboard to understand where content belongs and how activities should be built.

Training camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate players (especially rookies), scout the team's strengths and weaknesses, prepare the players for the rigorous regular season and determine the 12-man active roster (and a 3-man inactive list) with which they will begin the regular season. Teams have the ability to assign players with less than two years of experience to the NBA G League. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held. Preseason matches are sometimes held in non-NBA cities, both in the United States and overseas. The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October.\n\nDuring the regular season, each team plays 82 games, 41 each home and away. A team faces opponents in its own division four times a year (16 games). Each team plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in its conference four times (24 games), and the remaining four teams three times (12 games). Finally, each team plays all the teams in the other conference twice apiece (30 games). This asymmetrical structure means the strength of schedule will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the NFL or MLB). Over five seasons, each team will have played 80 games against their division (20 games against each opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the road), 180 games against the rest of their conference (18 games against each opponent, 9 at home, 9 on the road), and 150 games against the other conference (10 games against each team, 5 at home, 5 on the road).\n\nThe NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules games on Christmas Day. The league has been playing games regularly on the holiday since 1947, though the first Christmas Day games were not televised until 1983\u201384. Games played on this day have featured some of the best teams and players. Christmas is also notable for NBA on television, as the holiday is when the first NBA games air on network television each season. Games played on this day have been some of the highest-rated games during a particular season.\n\nIn February, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual NBA All-Star Game. Fans vote throughout the United States, Canada, and on the Internet, and the top vote-getters in each conference are named captains. Fan votes determine the rest of the allstar starters. Coaches vote to choose the remaining 14 All-Stars. Then, the top vote-getters in each conference draft their own team from a player pool of allstars. The top vote-getter in the league earns first pick and so forth. The player with the best performance during the game is rewarded with a Game MVP award. Other attractions of the All-Star break include the Rising Stars Challenge (originally Rookie Challenge), where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play in a 5-on-5 basketball game, with the current format pitting U.S. players against those from the rest of the world; the Skills Challenge, where players compete to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the fastest time; the Three Point Contest, where players compete to score the highest number of three-point field goals in a given time; and the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, where players compete to dunk the ball in the most entertaining way according to the judges. These other attractions have varying names which include the names of the various sponsors who have paid for naming rights.\n\nShortly after the All-Star break is the trade deadline, which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in February) at 3 pm Eastern Time. After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for general managers.\n\nAround the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting begins for individual awards, as well as the selection of the honorary, league-wide, postseason teams. The Sixth Man of the Year Award is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started). The Rookie of the Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The Most Improved Player Award is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award is awarded to the league's best defender. The Coach of the Year Award is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The Most Valuable Player Award is given to the player deemed the most valuable for (his team) that season. Additionally, Sporting News awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) Executive of the Year Award to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise.\n\nThe postseason teams are the All-NBA Team, the All-Defensive Team, and the All-Rookie Team; each consists of five players. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team status being the most desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each position.

If one picks optimally (in terms of the achieved speedup) what is to be improved, then one will see monotonically decreasing improvements as one improves. If, however, one picks non-optimally, after improving a sub-optimal component and moving on to improve a more optimal component, one can see an increase in the return. Note that it is often rational to improve a system in an order that is \"non-optimal\" in this sense, given that some improvements are more difficult or require larger development time than others.\n\nAmdahl's law does represent the law of diminishing returns if one is considering what sort of return one gets by adding more processors to a machine, if one is running a fixed-size computation that will use all available processors to their capacity. Each new processor added to the system will add less usable power than the previous one. Each time one doubles the number of processors the speedup ratio will diminish, as the total throughput heads toward the limit of 1/(1 \u2212 p).\n\nThis analysis neglects other potential bottlenecks such as memory bandwidth and I/O bandwidth. If these resources do not scale with the number of processors, then merely adding processors provides even lower returns.\n\nAn implication of Amdahl's law is that to speed up real applications which have both serial and parallel portions, heterogeneous computing techniques are required. There are novel speedup and energy consumption models based on a more general representation of heterogeneity, referred to as the normal form heterogeneity, that support a wide range of heterogeneous many-core architectures. These modelling methods aim to predict system power efficiency and performance ranges, and facilitates research and development at the hardware and system software levels.", "response": "The law of diminishing returns represents a special case of the application of Amdahl's law.

Her genre-spanning discography, songwriting and artistic reinventions have received critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country artist to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.\n\nSwift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\n\nExiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021\u2014Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her 2022 album Midnights and single \"Anti-Hero\" broke all-time streaming records. Swift has directed music videos and films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and played supporting roles in others.\n\nHaving sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians in history. She is the most streamed woman on Spotify, and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards; and 92 Guinness World Records. Swift has been featured in rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100.

The first stage of PC boot loaders (FSBL, first-stage boot loader) located on fixed disks and removable drives must fit into the first 446 bytes of the Master boot record in order to leave room for the default 64-byte partition table with four partition entries and the two-byte boot signature, which the BIOS requires for a proper boot loader \u2014 or even less, when additional features like more than four partition entries (up to 16 with 16 bytes each), a disk signature (6 bytes), a disk timestamp (6 bytes), an Advanced Active Partition (18 bytes) or special multi-boot loaders have to be supported as well in some environments. In floppy and superfloppy volume boot records, up to 59 bytes are occupied for the extended BIOS parameter block on FAT12 and FAT16 volumes since DOS 4.0, whereas the FAT32 EBPB introduced with DOS 7.1 requires even 87 bytes, leaving only 423 bytes for the boot loader when assuming a sector size of 512 bytes. Microsoft boot sectors therefore traditionally imposed certain restrictions on the boot process, for example, the boot file had to be located at a fixed position in the root directory of the file system and stored as consecutive sectors,conditions taken care of by the SYS command and slightly relaxed in later versions of DOS.The boot loader was then able to load the first three sectors of the file into memory, which happened to contain another embedded boot loader able to load the remainder of the file into memory.When Microsoft added LBA and FAT32 support, they even switched to a boot loader reaching over two physical sectors and using 386 instructions for size reasons. At the same time other vendors managed to squeeze much more functionality into a single boot sector without relaxing the original constraints on only minimal available memory (32 KiB) and processor support (8088/8086). For example, DR-DOS boot sectors are able to locate the boot file in the FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 file system, and load it into memory as a whole via CHS or LBA, even if the file is not stored in a fixed location and in consecutive sectors.\n\nBIOS and UEFI not only load the operating system from a non-volatile device, they also initialize system hardware for operating system.\n\nExamples of first-stage bootloaders include BIOS, coreboot, Libreboot and Das U-Boot.", "response": "The first-stage bootloader (FSBL) is the first boot stage for the HPS.

How did the Spanish Empire treat its overseas territories?", "context": "", "response": "The Spanish Empire lasted for four centuries, from the arrival of Columbus in America in 1492 until the loss of its last overseas territories (Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines) in 1898. In its last period, towards the middle of the 19th century, a debate arose that, to this day, still raises blisters regarding the definition of these lands. A part of the population continues to consider that the lands that Spain conquered beyond the seas were colonies, while another part defines them as provinces. That is, like Valladolid, Barcelona or Guadalajara.\nIn the Royal Decree of Carlos V, promulgated in 1519, which was later included in the Compilation of Laws of the Indies, the following declaration of intent could already be read: \u00abThat the West Indies be always united to the Crown of Castile and that cannot be alienated. We order that, at no time, they can be separated by our royal crown of Castile, disunited or divided in whole or in part or in favor of any person.\u00bb\nThe Spanish laws always spoke of \"provinces\", \"kingdoms\", \"republics\", \"empires\" or \"territories of islands and mainland\". In other words, the term \"colony\" was never used in the legal field for the territories that had been incorporated into the Crown of Castile. It was incorporated later and only with a critical and propagandistic desire, the same as it is today when it is used. This is not an excuse to deny that in the Spanish overseas territories there were models of exploitation that could be considered colonial, such as the monopoly of the extraction of precious metals or certain types of commercial companies. One of the main proofs is that the overseas territories reproduced most of the institutions of the metropolis.\nBernardino Bravo Lira, winner of Chile's 2010 National History Award, noted an important difference:\n\"Politically, the Indies were incorporated into the Crown and not into the Kingdom of Castile. This means that they were not considered as simple land, without their own political personality and, therefore, susceptible to submission to a foreign power. They were considered as other kingdoms, similar to Castile and other Europeans, endowed with the same attributes as them. For this reason they were classified and organized under the form of State of the Indies and not colonies. The kingdoms of the Indies had all the elements that then made up a State: territory, population, nationality, institutions, government and their own legislation.\"\nThis means that, contrary to what most critical authors think, the territories conquered by Spain were never considered as colonies devoid of rights. Moreover, its inhabitants were considered, already with Queen Isabella of Castilla, vassals of the Crown like any other inhabitant of the Iberian Peninsula, once the conquest process was completed in the 16th century. That is why the Indies, which have been known as \"America\" \u200b\u200bsince the 17th century, owed allegiance only to the King, who governed through the institutions created for that purpose and which were governed by officials designated for that purpose.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "What is a good dad joke?", "context": "", "response": "What do you call an okay factory?

Bat will be made up of wood and ball can be either tennis ball or hard ball which is made up of leather. You need a wicket which is 3 sticks and 2 bails on top. One person throws the ball and other person try to protect his wickets with the bat. The length of the wicket is 22 yards. Batsman can hit the ball for runs. To make runs, there are two ways. First is to hit the boundary, which can fetch either 4 or 6 runs. Second way is to run between the wickets and make as many runs as you can. There are other ways to get runs as well, like if its a wide ball or no ball. For a team to win a match, they either have to make more runs then the other team or get them all out before they can make more runs then them. Most popular cricket format is T20, then One day internationals (ODI) and then Test matches. T20 is the shortest form and have 20 overs and 2 innings. ODI has 50 overs and 2 innings.

Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.

The engines were air-cooled until 1999, when Porsche started using water-cooled engines.\n\nIn April 2011, Porsche announced the third generation of the 997 GT3 RS with an enlarged 4.0-litre engine having a power output of 500 PS (368 kW; 493 hp). The naturally-aspirated 4.0-litre flat-six engine (the largest engine offered in a street-legal 911) was introduced with their 911 (997) GT3 RS 4.0, in 2011. The engine itself uses the crankshaft from the RSR with increased stroke dimensions (from 76.4 mm to 80.4 mm). This change increased the power output to 500 PS (368 kW; 493 hp) at 8,250 rpm and 460 N\u22c5m (339 lbf\u22c5ft) of torque at 5,750 rpm. giving it a power-to-weight ratio of 365 hp per ton. Only 600 cars were built. At 493 hp (368 kW), the engine is one of the most powerful six-cylinder naturally aspirated engines in any production car with a 123.25 hp (92 kW) per litre output.\n\nOther Porsche models that use flat-six engines are the 1970\u20131972 Porsche 914/6 (mid-engine), the 1986\u20131993 Porsche 959 (rear-engine), and the 1996\u20132021 Porsche Boxster/Cayman (mid-engine).\n\nThe Porsche 962 sports prototype also used a twin-turbocharged flat-six engine.\n\nThese engines have also been used by German tuning company RUF in various replica Porsche sports cars.", "response": "The most powerful flat six engine made by Porsche is the 997 GT3 RS 4.0.

Each point on the painting can be represented as a vector pointing from the center of the painting to that point. The linear transformation in this example is called a shear mapping. Points in the top half are moved to the right, and points in the bottom half are moved to the left, proportional to how far they are from the horizontal axis that goes through the middle of the painting. The vectors pointing to each point in the original image are therefore tilted right or left, and made longer or shorter by the transformation. Points along the horizontal axis do not move at all when this transformation is applied. Therefore, any vector that points directly to the right or left with no vertical component is an eigenvector of this transformation, because the mapping does not change its direction. Moreover, these eigenvectors all have an eigenvalue equal to one, because the mapping does not change their length either.", "response": "An eigenvector of a mapping is any vector that does not change direction when the mapping is applied to it.", "category": "summarization"}, {"instruction": "what book would you recommend for pregnant women?", "context": "", "response": "Pregnant women have a lot on their plate, including their own physical and mental health and preparation for childbirth and newborn care.

Humans are broadly characterized by their bipedalism and high intelligence. Humans' large brain and resulting cognitive skills have allowed them to thrive in a variety of environments and develop complex societies and civilizations. Humans are highly social and tend to live in complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. As such, social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, languages, and rituals, each of which bolsters human society. The desire to understand and influence phenomena has motivated humanity's development of science, technology, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other conceptual frameworks.\n\nAlthough some scientists equate the term \"humans\" with all members of the genus Homo, in common usage it generally refers to Homo sapiens, the only extant member. Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis or a similar species and migrating out of Africa, gradually replacing or interbreeding with local populations of archaic humans. For most of history, humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000\u201360,000 years ago. The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago (and separately in a few other places), saw the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement. As populations became larger and denser, forms of governance developed within and between communities, and a number of civilizations have risen and fallen. Humans have continued to expand, with a global population of over 8 billion as of 2022.\n\nGenes and the environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility, mental abilities, body size, and life span. Though humans vary in many traits (such as genetic predispositions and physical features), any two humans are at least 99% genetically similar. Humans are sexually dimorphic: generally, males have greater body strength and females have a higher body fat percentage. At puberty, humans develop secondary sexual characteristics. Females are capable of pregnancy, usually between puberty, at around 12 years old, and menopause, around the age of 50.\n\nHumans are omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material, and have used fire and other forms of heat to prepare and cook food since the time of Homo erectus. Humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food and three or four days without water. Humans are generally diurnal, sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day. Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death. Often, both the mother and the father provide care for their children, who are helpless at birth.\n\nHumans have a large, highly developed, and complex prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition. Humans are highly intelligent, capable of episodic memory, have flexible facial expressions, self-awareness, and a theory of mind. The human mind is capable of introspection, private thought, imagination, volition, and forming views on existence. This has allowed great technological advancements and complex tool development to be possible through complex reasoning and the transmission of knowledge to subsequent generations. Language, art, and trade are defining characteristics of humans. Long-distance trade routes might have led to cultural explosions and resource distribution that gave humans an advantage over other similar species.", "response": "Homo sapiens\nAnatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis or a similar species and migrating out of Africa, gradually replacing or interbreeding with local populations of archaic humans.

It was established by the 42nd U.S. Congress with the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872. Yellowstone was the first national park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world. The park is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially the Old Faithful geyser, one of its most popular. While it represents many types of biomes, the subalpine forest is the most abundant. It is part of the South Central Rockies forests ecoregion.\n\nWhile Native Americans have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years, aside from visits by mountain men during the early-to-mid-19th century, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. Management and control of the park originally fell under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the first Secretary of the Interior to supervise the park being Columbus Delano. However, the U.S. Army was eventually commissioned to oversee the management of Yellowstone for 30 years between 1886 and 1916. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the National Park Service, which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than a thousand archaeological sites.\n\nYellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468.4 sq mi (8,983 km2), comprising lakes, canyons, rivers, and mountain ranges. Yellowstone Lake is one of the largest high-elevation lakes in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest super volcano on the continent. The caldera is considered a dormant volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Well over half of the world's geysers and hydrothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone. In 1978, Yellowstone was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nHundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians have been documented, including several that are either endangered or threatened. The vast forests and grasslands also include unique species of plants. Yellowstone Park is the largest, and most famous megafauna location in the contiguous United States. Grizzly bears, cougars, wolves, and free-ranging herds of bison and elk live in this park. The Yellowstone Park bison herd is the oldest and largest public bison herd in the United States. Forest fires occur in the park each year; in the large forest fires of 1988, nearly one-third of the park was burnt. Yellowstone has numerous recreational opportunities, including hiking, camping, boating, fishing, and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either snow coaches or snowmobiles.", "response": "Generally considered to be the first national park in the world, Yellowstone National Park is significant in size, covering parts of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, and acts as the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystems.

Forests and grasslands dominate some areas of the park, while others offer the completely different experience of mountain ranges, lakes, and rolling prairies.  Some of the park's most unique features are the geysers and hydrothermal features.  In fact, Yellowstone is home to over half of the world's features like these.

Capa's brainchild, Magnum was a cooperative picture agency owned by its members. The team split photo assignments among the members. Rodger, who had quit Life in London after covering World War II, would cover Africa and the Middle East. Chim, who spoke a variety of European languages, would work in Europe. Cartier-Bresson would be assigned to India and China. Vandivert, who had also left Life, would work in America, and Capa would work anywhere that had an assignment. Maria Eisner managed the Paris office and Rita Vandivert, Vandivert's wife, managed the New York office and became Magnum's first president.\n\nCartier-Bresson achieved international recognition for his coverage of Gandhi's funeral in India in 1948 and the last stage of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. He covered the last six months of the Kuomintang administration and the first six months of the Maoist People's Republic. He also photographed the last surviving Imperial eunuchs in Beijing, as the city was being liberated by the communists. In Shanghai, he often worked in the company of photojournalist Sam Tata, whom Cartier-Bresson had previously befriended in Bombay. From China, he went on to Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), where he documented the gaining of independence from the Dutch. In 1950, Cartier-Bresson had traveled to the South India. He had visited Tiruvannamalai, a town in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu and photographed the last moments of Ramana Maharishi, Sri Ramana Ashram and its surroundings. A few days later he also visited and photographed Sri Aurobindo, Mother and Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry.\n\nMagnum's mission was to \"feel the pulse\" of the times and some of its first projects were People Live Everywhere, Youth of the World, Women of the World and The Child Generation. Magnum aimed to use photography in the service of humanity, and provided arresting, widely viewed images.\n\nThe Decisive Moment\n\n1952 US edition of Cartier-Bresson's 1952 book The Decisive Moment (Images \u00e0 la sauvette).\n\nPhotograph of Alberto Giacometti by Cartier-Bresson\nIn 1952, Cartier-Bresson published his book Images \u00e0 la sauvette, whose English-language edition was titled The Decisive Moment, although the French language title actually translates as \"images on the sly\" or \"hastily taken images\", Images \u00e0 la sauvette included a portfolio of 126 of his photos from the East and the West. The book's cover was drawn by Henri Matisse. For his 4,500-word philosophical preface, Cartier-Bresson took his keynote text from the 17th century Cardinal de Retz, \"Il n'y a rien dans ce monde qui n'ait un moment decisif\" (\"There is nothing in this world that does not have a decisive moment\"). Cartier-Bresson applied this to his photographic style. He said: \"Photographier: c'est dans un m\u00eame instant et en une fraction de seconde reconna\u00eetre un fait et l'organisation rigoureuse de formes per\u00e7ues visuellement qui expriment et signifient ce fait\" (\"To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as of a precise organization of forms which give that event its proper expression.\").\n\nBoth titles came from T\u00e9riade, the Greek-born French publisher whom Cartier-Bresson admired. He gave the book its French title, Images \u00e0 la Sauvette, loosely translated as \"images on the run\" or \"stolen images.\" Dick Simon of Simon & Schuster came up with the English title The Decisive Moment. Margot Shore, Magnum's Paris bureau chief, translated Cartier-Bresson's French preface into English.\n\n\"Photography is not like painting,\" Cartier-Bresson told the Washington Post in 1957. \"There is a creative fraction of a second when you are taking a picture. Your eye must see a composition or an expression that life itself offers you, and you must know with intuition when to click the camera. That is the moment the photographer is creative,\" he said. \"Oop! The Moment! Once you miss it, it is gone forever.\"\n\nThe photo Rue Mouffetard, Paris, taken in 1954, has since become a classic example of Cartier-Bresson's ability to capture a decisive moment.

The three biggest concerns revolve around:\n\n1. A short growing season\n2. Cooler summers\n3. Wetter than average summers\n\nHere are some solutions you can use to mitigate these challenges.\n\nDo deal with the short growing season, you need to get a headstart on growing by using starters. What this means is that instead of planting a seed in the ground in Springtime, you start a seed indoors in late winter, grow it into a small to medium plant, then transplant that \"starter\", into the ground when the temperature is warm enough. You can buy starters from Nurseries, or start your own at home. Nursery starters are easier, but by growing at home you can experiment with more rare varieties and gain experience in cultivating a plant from the seedling stage. If you grow your own it's important to slowly climatize the plant to outdoor weather leading up to the transplant date by moving it outside starting with a couple hours a day, increasing an hour or two per day over 2-3 weeks. By using starters you essentially extend the growing season by giving your plant a multi month head start. \n\nTomatoes mature best in warm to hot climates. The pacific northwest has cooler summers than many of the growing regions in the world. There is not a lot we can do to control mother nature, but there are one or two methods to help yourself here. Certain varieties of tomatoes do better in cooler summers - try and select these. If you're using starts from a local nursery they can guide you - starts from big national box stores might not be the best for your local Northwest climate. Another technique, if you are experiencing a cooler than normal Spring and start of Summer, is to build a \"hoop house\", using PVC pipe frame and a visqueen tarp. This will let light in and act as a mini-greenhouse, trapping heat around the plant. Keep in mind tomatoes need pollinators like bees to produce fruit, so once the plan t begins to flower you'll want to ensure pollination can occur.\n\nMoisture creates issues with Tomato plants as they are very susceptible to various types of fungus that grow on the leaves. Blight is one in particular common among tomatoes. The wet summers we sometimes have create conditions on the leaves conducive to fungal growth, they can also splash fungus onto the leaves from the soil. The easiest way to deal with these two issues is in proper pruning. As early as you can prune any lower sets of leaves that could possibly come into contact with the ground. Don't do this too soon as the plant needs some leaves to grow. There are many ways to prune a tomato that you can read about, but one common one in wet areas is called single stemming - in this technique you prune \"suckers\", which are the small offshoots that grow in between the main stem and the leaf stems. By pruning the suckers you prevent too much bushy growth, which will help the leaves dry out with airflow after a rain storm. The last issue related to water is that heavy late season rains will cause the fruits to swell with water and crack. There's not an easy solution here. If it's towards the end of the season and a rainstorm is coming in, this can be a good time to pick all your fruit, your green tomatoes can be used for green salsas. Some will resort to building a tarp structure above the plants to stop the rain, though this can require a bit more work and ingenuity, and you'll need another system to keep the plants watered.\n\nOverall, growing tomatoes in the Pacific Northwest is totally possible and very rewarding.

The Soviets perceived the Marshall Plan to be the foundation for an anti-Soviet alliance and pressured the Americans, British and French to back down. On 20 March 1948, the Soviet representative walked out of the meeting of the Allied Control Council, and on 31 March 1948, the United States Congress approved funding for the Marshall Plan.

Crate scooters preceded skateboards, having a wooden crate attached to the nose (front of the board), which formed rudimentary handlebars. The boxes turned into planks, similar to the skateboard decks of today.\n\nSkateboarding, as it exists today, was probably born sometime in the late 1940s, or early 1950s, when surfers in California wanted something to do when the waves were flat. This was called \"sidewalk surfing\" \u2013 a new wave of surfing on the sidewalk as the sport of surfing became highly popular. No one knows who made the first board; it seems that several people came up with similar ideas at around the same time. The first manufactured skateboards were ordered by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant to be used by surfers in their downtime. The shop owner, Bill Richard, made a deal with the Chicago Roller Skate Company to produce sets of skate wheels, which they attached to square wooden boards. Accordingly, skateboarding was originally denoted \"sidewalk surfing\" and early skaters emulated surfing style and maneuvers, and performed barefoot.\n\nBy the 1960s a small number of surfing manufacturers in Southern California such as Jack's, Kips', Hobie, Bing's and Makaha started building skateboards that resembled small surfboards, and assembled teams to promote their products. One of the earliest Skateboard exhibitions was sponsored by Makaha's founder, Larry Stevenson, in 1963 and held at the Pier Avenue Junior High School in Hermosa Beach, California. Some of these same teams of skateboarders were also featured on a television show called Surf's Up in 1964, hosted by Stan Richards, that helped promote skateboarding as something new and fun to do.\n\nAs the popularity of skateboarding began expanding, the first skateboarding magazine, The Quarterly Skateboarder was published in 1964. John Severson, who published the magazine, wrote in his first editorial:\n\nToday's skateboarders are founders in this sport\u2014they're pioneers\u2014they are the first. There is no history in Skateboarding\u2014its being made now\u2014by you. The sport is being molded and we believe that doing the right thing now will lead to a bright future for the sport. Already, there are storm clouds on the horizon with opponents of the sport talking about ban and restriction.\n\nThe magazine only lasted four issues, but resumed publication as Skateboarder in 1975. The first broadcast of an actual skateboarding competition was the 1965 National Skateboarding Championships, which were held in Anaheim, California and aired on ABC's Wide World of Sports. Because skateboarding was a new sport during this time, there were only two original disciplines during competitions: flatland freestyle and slalom downhill racing.\n\nAnimated cartoons of the time occasionally featured skateboard gags. Two Road Runner cartoons made in 1965, Shot and Bothered and Out and Out Rout, feature Wile E. Coyote riding a skateboard.\n\nOne of the earliest sponsored skateboarders, Patti McGee, was paid by Hobie and Vita Pak to travel around the country to do skateboarding exhibitions and to demonstrate skateboarding safety tips. McGee made the cover of Life magazine in 1965 and was featured on several popular television programs\u2014The Mike Douglas Show, What's My Line? and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\u2014which helped make skateboarding even more popular at the time. Some other well known surfer-style skateboarders of the time were Danny Bearer, Torger Johnson, Bruce Logan, Bill and Mark Richards, Woody Woodward, and Jim Fitzpatrick.\n\nThe growth of the sport during this period can also be seen in sales figures for Makaha, which quoted $4 million worth of board sales between 1963 and 1965. By 1966 a variety of sources began to claim that skateboarding was dangerous, resulting in shops being reluctant to sell them, and parents being reluctant to buy them. In 1966 sales had dropped significantly and Skateboarder Magazine had stopped publication. The popularity of skateboarding dropped and remained low until the early 1970s.", "response": "Sidewalk surfing, known today as skateboarding, originated in the late 1940s out of the desire of California surfers hoping to still ride when waves were flat.

First publicly disclosed by Google on January 12, 2010, in a blog post, the attacks began in mid-2009 and continued through December 2009.\n\nThe attack was aimed at dozens of other organizations, of which Adobe Systems, Akamai Technologies, Juniper Networks, and Rackspace have publicly confirmed that they were targeted. According to media reports, Yahoo, Symantec, Northrop Grumman, Morgan Stanley, and Dow Chemical were also among the targets.\n\nAs a result of the attack, Google stated in its blog that it plans to operate a completely uncensored version of its search engine in China \"within the law, if at all,\" and acknowledged that if this is not possible, it may leave China and close its Chinese offices. Official Chinese sources claimed this was part of a strategy developed by the U.S. government.\n\nThe attack was named \"Operation Aurora\" by Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of Threat Research at cybersecurity company McAfee. Research by McAfee Labs discovered that \"Aurora\" was part of the file path on the attacker's machine that was included in two of the malware binaries McAfee said were associated with the attack. \"We believe the name was the internal name the attacker(s) gave to this operation,\" McAfee Chief Technology Officer George Kurtz said in a blog post.\n\nAccording to McAfee, the primary goal of the attack was to gain access to and potentially modify source code repositories at these high-tech, security, and defense contractor companies. \"[The SCMs] were wide open,\" says Alperovitch. \"No one ever thought about securing them, yet these were the crown jewels of most of these companies in many ways\u2014much more valuable than any financial or personally identifiable data that they may have and spend so much time and effort protecting.\"\n\nHistory\n\nFlowers left outside Google China's headquarters after its announcement it might leave the country\nOn January 12, 2010, Google revealed on its blog that it had been the victim of a cyber attack. The company said the attack occurred in mid-December and originated from China. Google stated that over 20 other companies had been attacked; other sources have since cited that more than 34 organizations were targeted. As a result of the attack, Google said it was reviewing its business in China. On the same day, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a brief statement condemning the attacks and requesting a response from China.\n\nOn January 13, 2010, the news agency All Headline News reported that the United States Congress plans to investigate Google's allegations that the Chinese government used the company's service to spy on human rights activists.\n\nIn Beijing, visitors left flowers outside of Google's office. However, these were later removed, with a Chinese security guard stating that this was an \"illegal flower tribute\". The Chinese government has yet to issue a formal response, although an anonymous official stated that China was seeking more information on Google's intentions.\n\nAttackers involved\nFurther information: Cyberwarfare by China\nTechnical evidence including IP addresses, domain names, malware signatures, and other factors, show Elderwood was behind the Operation Aurora attack. The \"Elderwood\" group was named by Symantec (after a source-code variable used by the attackers), and is referred to as the \"Beijing Group\" by Dell Secureworks. The group obtained some of Google's source code, as well as access to information about Chinese activists. Elderwood also targeted numerous other companies in the shipping, aeronautics, arms, energy, manufacturing, engineering, electronics, financial, and software sectors.\n\nThe \"APT\" designation for the Chinese threat actors responsible for attacking Google is APT17.\n\nElderwood specializes in attacking and infiltrating second-tier defense industry suppliers that make electronic or mechanical components for top defense companies. Those firms then become a cyber \"stepping stone\" to gain access to top-tier defense contractors. One attack procedure used by Elderwood is to infect legitimate websites frequented by employees of the target company \u2013 a so-called \"water hole\" attack, just as lions stake out a watering hole for their prey. Elderwood infects these less-secure sites with malware that downloads to a computer that clicks on the site. After that, the group searches inside the network to which the infected computer is connected, finding and then downloading executives' e-mails and critical documents on company plans, decisions, acquisitions, and product designs.\n\nAttack analysis\nIn its blog posting, Google stated that some of its intellectual property had been stolen. It suggested that the attackers were interested in accessing Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents. According to the Financial Times, two accounts used by Ai Weiwei had been attacked, their contents read and copied; his bank accounts were investigated by state security agents who claimed he was under investigation for \"unspecified suspected crimes\". However, the attackers were only able to view details on two accounts and those details were limited to things such as the subject line and the accounts' creation date.\n\nSecurity experts immediately noted the sophistication of the attack. Two days after the attack became public, McAfee reported that the attackers had exploited purported zero-day vulnerabilities (unfixed and previously unknown to the target system developers) in Internet Explorer and dubbed the attack \"Operation Aurora\". A week after the report by McAfee, Microsoft issued a fix for the issue, and admitted that they had known about the security hole used since September. Additional vulnerabilities were found in Perforce, the source code revision software used by Google to manage their source code.\n\nVeriSign's iDefense Labs claimed that the attacks were perpetrated by \"agents of the Chinese state or proxies thereof\".\n\nAccording to a diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, a Chinese source reported that the Chinese Politburo directed the intrusion into Google's computer systems. The cable suggested that the attack was part of a coordinated campaign executed by \"government operatives, public security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the Chinese government.\" The report suggested that it was part of an ongoing campaign in which attackers have \"broken into American government computers and those of Western allies, the Dalai Lama and American businesses since 2002.\" According to The Guardian's reporting on the leak, the attacks were \"orchestrated by a senior member of the Politburo who typed his own name into the global version of the search engine and found articles criticising him personally.\"\n\nOnce a victim's system was compromised, a backdoor connection that masqueraded as an SSL connection made connections to command and control servers running in Illinois, Texas, and Taiwan, including machines that were running under stolen Rackspace customer accounts. The victim's machine then began exploring the protected corporate intranet that it was a part of, searching for other vulnerable systems as well as sources of intellectual property, specifically the contents of source code repositories.\n\nThe attacks were thought to have definitively ended on Jan 4 when the command and control servers were taken down, although it is not known at this point whether or not the attackers intentionally shut them down. However, the attacks were still occurring as of February 2010.\n\nResponse and aftermath\nThe German, Australian, and French governments publicly issued warnings to users of Internet Explorer after the attack, advising them to use alternative browsers at least until a fix for the security hole was made. The German, Australian, and French governments considered all versions of Internet Explorer vulnerable or potentially vulnerable.\n\nIn an advisory on January 14, 2010, Microsoft said that attackers targeting Google and other U.S. companies used software that exploits a hole in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8 on Windows 7, Vista, Windows XP, Server 2003, Server 2008 R2, as well as IE 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.\n\nThe Internet Explorer exploit code used in the attack has been released into the public domain, and has been incorporated into the Metasploit Framework penetration testing tool. A copy of the exploit was uploaded to Wepawet, a service for detecting and analyzing web-based malware operated by the computer security group at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \"The public release of the exploit code increases the possibility of widespread attacks using the Internet Explorer vulnerability,\" said George Kurtz, CTO of McAfee, of the attack. \"The now public computer code may help cybercriminals craft attacks that use the vulnerability to compromise Windows systems.\"\n\nSecurity company Websense said it identified \"limited public use\" of the unpatched IE vulnerability in drive-by attacks against users who strayed onto malicious Web sites. According to Websense, the attack code it spotted is the same as the exploit that went public last week.[clarification needed] \"Internet Explorer users currently face a real and present danger due to the public disclosure of the vulnerability and release of attack code, increasing the possibility of widespread attacks,\" said George Kurtz, chief technology officer of McAfee, in a blog update. Confirming this speculation, Websense Security Labs identified additional sites using the exploit on January 19.

The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth observers being in a rotating reference frame; this apparent motion caused many cultures to have mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model, which prevailed until astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus formulated his heliocentric model in the 16th century.\nAstronomically, sunrise occurs for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon. However, the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point:\nTwilight, the period in the morning during which the sky is brightening, but the Sun is not yet visible. The beginning of morning twilight is called astronomical dawn.\nThe period after the Sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen.\nThe timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and is also affected by the viewer's latitude and longitude, altitude, and time zone. These changes are driven by the axial tilt of Earth, daily rotation of the Earth, the planet's movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the Sun, and the Earth and Moon's paired revolutions around each other. The analemma can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise.\nIn late winter and spring, sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day, reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice; although the exact date varies by latitude. After this point, the time of sunrise gets later each day, reaching its latest sometime around the winter solstice. The offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis, and is described by the analemma, which can be used to predict the dates.\nVariations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position. Near the poles, the time-of-day variation is exaggerated, since the Sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly.\nAccounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of day relative to night. The sunrise equation, however, which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset, uses the Sun's physical center for calculation, neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc.", "response": "Although the Sun appears to \"rise\" from the horizon, it is actually the Earth's motion that causes the Sun to appear.

Achaya states that the earliest written mention of dosa appears in literature of present-day Tamil Nadu, in the 8th century, while the earliest mention of dosa in the Kannada literature appears a century later.\n\nIn popular tradition, the origin of the dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's association with Udupi restaurants. The Tamil dosai is softer and thicker. The thinner and crispier version of dosa was first made in present-day Karnataka. A recipe for dosa can be found in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.\n\nAfter the Independence of India, South Indian cuisine became gradually popular in the North.

They are a beautiful symbol of innocence. But have you noticed there are fewer and fewer every year? When I was a kid, you couldn\u2019t take a trip without getting some butterflies on the windshield of your car. So why are there so few and what does it mean?\n\nOne of the main reasons is the use of pesticides and herbicides. These chemicals are indiscriminate killers. And they knock the whole ecosystem out of balance. In my yard, I have seen how a little patience will put things back into balance. I had aphids, but slowly noticed aphid predators solving the problem. I had flies due to my chicken coop, but over a few weeks I saw Swallows and Phoebes move in to take advantage of the food source.\n\nThe other reason we see fewer butterflies is food for caterpillars. Most butterflies and moths (or butterflies of the night as I like to call them) need a particular plant to host their caterpillars. For Monarch butterflies, it is Milkweed (Asclepias), which is an unfortunate name for a beautiful plant. For Pipevine Swallowtails, it is Pipevine (Aristolochia). Without these plants, caterpillars have no source of food. And as cities and suburbs become paved over, there is no place for these once abundant plants to grow. As we look at our own yards, they contain beautiful plants that are imported from other places. But to a butterfly, our yards seem like deserts. Even plants like bottlebrush, which attract a lot of insects for nectar, provide no food for native baby insects. It\u2019s kind of like having a bar for the adults to drink at, but no food to nourish their children so they can grow to be adults too. \n\nBut Doug Tallamy, an entomologist from University of Delaware, says we can help. By putting some native plants in our yards, we can provide the food to bring back butterflies.\n\nAs we prepared to redo our garden from evergreen ornamentals, to an English cottage/cut flower garden, something happened. We saw Doug Tallamy speak on a CNPS Silicon Valley Zoom Meeting. And we realized we had to change our direction, and begin gardening with natives. \n\nAs we look at our garden, the key is that we are just beginning\u2026\nIt is a grand experiment to see what works where. And already the garden is talking to us. The blue eyed grass has jumped the paved walkway to another part of the garden! We expect more movement and magic in the future. Here are some of our thoughts on our garden.\n\nBlessings\u2026 Having a giant oak tree in our yard and creek behind us have certainly given us a leg up in terms of food and wildlife access to our yard.\n\nDownside\u2026 Lots of shade. Only two, maybe three spots in our garden that get good sun. So, we troll through Calscape looking for plants that will tolerate shade. (If you haven't met Calscape you are in for a treat. I hope you live in California though...).\n\nGoal\u2026 As Talamites, we believe in feeding the ecosystem, which starts with caterpillar farming. So how has that worked out? Well, we\u2019ve only seen one or two caterpillars so far. Sigh. It\u2019s all an experiment\u2026\n\nBiggest impact\u2026 Leaving the leaves the past year. We can already see the soil improving, and everytime we water we see lots of insects rising up out of the litter. So it is happening. Slowly\u2026\n\nSo we continue to replace non-natives with natives. Last weekend we took out Sarcococca and Pierris Japonicas and replaced them with Coffeeberry (Frangula Californica). This weekend we removed two maple trees and replaced them with Bush Anemone (Carpenteria Californica). And next weekend we are going to replace our box hedge with Coyote Brush (Baccharis pilularis). \n\nBesides the bugs, we've seen lots of other great wildlife in our yard. A new nest of baby squirrels is born in the tree every year. And this year we were surprised by 3 baby raccoons moving into the tree (it is largely hollow).\n\nThey are sweet shy and adorable.

By 1910, photographs had become the magazine's trademark and Grosvenor was constantly on the search for \"dynamical pictures\" as Graham Bell called them, particularly those that provided a sense of motion in a still image.

National Geographic photography quickly shifted to digital photography for both its printed magazine and its website. In subsequent years, the cover, while keeping its yellow border, shed its oak leaf trim and bare table of contents, to allow for a full page photograph taken for one of the month's articles. Issues of National Geographic are often kept by subscribers for years and re-sold at thrift stores as collectibles.

There are several ways of charging these batteries. The most common is a plug that provides either 30A or 50A of power, depending on the RV size. Most RVs also have generators, but generators are noisy and require either gas or diesel to run. Some RVs with lithium batteries (or more rarely, lead acid), have a second alternator installed that charges the batteries while driving. Finally, solar power is a popular option.

The content provider provides the content in a variety of formats - including film, tape, CD, DVD, hard disks and digital files.\n\nCapture\nIf the content provided by the content provider is not already in a digital format, it must first be converted to a digital format. In the case of film or tape, this is often called the \u201ccapture\u201d process in which hardware will play back the original medium and \u201ccapture\u201d its contents and convert it into a digital format. This captured file is often captured at the highest feasible quality as it is expected to undergo various processes that could degrade the quality. Therefore, the highest possible capture is always desired.\n\nCompression\nThe captured digital file is often extremely large, requiring a large amount of digital storage space and impossible to deliver to the consumer via broadband methods. Therefore, it must be compressed in a process called encoding or transcoding.\n\nIn this process, a codec is used to compress the captured digital file into a format which is small enough to be delivered to the end-user, usually via broadband methods. This encoding process entails consideration of many variables as to how the file is to be compressed. For audio, this usually consists of bit-rate and sample rate. Additional variables for video include resolution, frame rate and also has its own bit-rate that needs to be specified.\n\nThese variables are determined by how a particular file is to be consumed; download, streaming to a PC, streaming to a mobile device, etc.\n\nQuality, however, often becomes an issue at this stage and great care is taken to ensure the quality of the medium is of the highest possible quality for its intended deliver method. For example, a video encoded for streaming to mobile devices requires a much higher level of compression than would for a PC download, so the quality of the video will not be nearly as good.\n\nQuality Control\nQuality control is required to ensure that a file that has been encoded properly, with desired results and free of corruption. The degree to which a file is considered acceptable is based either on the discretion of the party charged with encoding the content, or a specific standard defined by the content owner for which the encoding party must comply.\n\nQuality control need not only take place at this juncture. Most companies dealing with the digital supply chain process will subject the media to scrutiny of the quality control process at various stages including: original capture, post-compression, post-ingest and post-publish, thus ensuring the media has not become corrupt or has not been degraded undesirably during any stage along the digital supply chain process.\n\nDigital Asset Management\nThe digital asset management system handles the metadata, content and their related assets such as album cover and movie poster art. It is often the digital asset management systems which also handles the publishing of the content itself to a digital storefront. Some digital asset management systems specifically built for the digital supply chain and the delivery of electronic media will track the progress of content as it goes through the digital supply chain. A good digital asset management system should also include reporting tools which can report back on the status of various aspects of the digital supply chain itself.\n\nMetadata Entry\nMetadata is the information that identifies and describes the contents of a medium. This information can include media-specific information such as: Title, artist(s), production company, seasonal/episodic description, original release date, etc. Metadata can also include business-related information such as: pricing and availability.\n\nDigital Rights Management\nAn important aspect of the digital supply chain is the process of encrypting the content so that it cannot be played back without the proper license which is often acquired via purchase of content or subscription. This reduces the possibility of media being pirated.\n\nIngest\nIngest is the stage in which the compressed file and metadata are put into the digital asset management system. It is not necessary for the metadata and the compressed media file to be ingested into the system at the same time, however, there will be a point in the process in which both have been ingested into the system and the metadata can reference the media file.\n\nContent Delivery Network\nWhen media files are ingested they are hosted and delivered from a content delivery network (CDN) capable of delivering the media to the end-user. The CDN should be able to support the expected number of consumers.\n\nMerchant/Storefront/Digital Retailer/Digital Service Provider\nThe content will ultimately display on a digital storefront where the consumer can view a catalog listing of the content and access the content via purchase, subscription or other method a merchant has elected to make the content available.", "response": "Content Provider, Capture, Compression, Quality Control, Digital Asset Management, Metadata, Entry, Digital Rights Management, Ingest, Content Delivery Network, Merchant/Storefront/Digital, Retailer/Digital Service Provider", "category": "information_extraction"}, {"instruction": "Think up some locations for me to ask my partner out", "context": "", "response": "- On a greek island \n- At Disney World \n- At their favorite pizza place \n- On a cruise ship \n- At the end of a hike \n- At the Burj Khalifa \n- On a private charter helicopter ride \n- At Times Square, NYC\n- At the Taj Mahal \n-  At a surprise party in their favorite place growing up \n- where you first met your partner \n- where you first confessed that you like each other \n- at your favorite date spot \n- at the northern lights in Norway", "category": "brainstorming"}, {"instruction": "What are the benefits of meditation?", "context": "", "response": "Meditation enhances focus, memory, and mood.

On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision that he would sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.\nUpon leaving the Cavaliers, James drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought that the prolonged wait for James's choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show. Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James's actions. Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey. Former NBA players, including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, were also critical of James, condemning him for joining with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship as \"the man\". James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision. As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, he quickly gained a reputation as one of America's most disliked athletes, which was a radical change from prior years.

Essentially nearly all numbers start with 0 when dialled in the UK. The leading 0 is omitted when calling from overseas and the prefix \"+44\" is added in its place. The second digit indicates what type of number it is. So called geographic numbers (those associated with an area code) start with 01or 02. Numbers starting with 03 are not associated with any area code but are charged at the same rates as numbers beginning with 01 or 02. Mobile numbers always start with 07. Numbers starting 09 are premium rate numbers which incur high charges for providing additional services.  Numbers starting with 080 are toll free. Other numbers starting with 08 are charged at special rates but not the very high rates for 09 numbers.\n\nSpecial numbers that do not start with 0 include 999 and 112 for emergencies, 101 for non emergency Police matters, 111 for contacting the National Health Service in a non emergency and directory enquiries services that start with 118.\n\nThe history of UK area codes (beginning 01 and 02) dates back to the times when individual telephone exchanges had their own one, two or three character Subscriber Trunk Dialing (STD) codes (e.g. B for Birmingham or AY6 for Aylesbury). in 1966 STD codes were converted to numbers using the number patterns on telephone dials (where 2=ABC, 3 = DEF etc.) so Birmingham became 021, Aylesbury became 0296. 01 was the code allocated to London. Area codes were between 2 and five characters long including the leading zero. Following the area code a local number of between 3 and 7 digits was added for each line to make the complete number either 9 or 10 digits long. Callers within the same area code could dial other lines with the same code by simply dialling the local number omitting the area code. In 1968 area codes beginning 00 were moved to free up 00 for other uses.\n\nBy the 1980s a number of factors meant that some areas, especially London, were running out of codes. Various measures were introduced including, in 1990,  the splitting of London into 071 (inner London) and 081 (outer London).\n\nThe 80s and 90s also saw the gradual introduction of \"non geographic\" numbers e.g. the toll free 0800 numbers and a number of patterns for emerging mobile services. Premium rate services were also launched using 0898.\n\nIn 1995 on so called \"phONEday\" a leading 1 was added after the zero. London numbers became either 0171 or 0181, Birmingham 0121, Aylesbury 01296 etc.\n\nThis established the pattern we see today allowing for some area codes to move to \"02\" codes over the next few years. In addition larger cities were allocated new codes beginning 011 e.g. 0113 for Leeds, 0117 for Bristol.\n\nIn 2000 the \"big number change\" saw London codes changed yet again = 0171 became 020 7 and 0181 became 020 8 allowing for new London numbers to be issued starting with 020 3 and 020 4 .

The fourth plane was similarly intended to hit a federal government building in D.C., but crashed in a field following a passenger revolt. The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people and instigated the global war on terror.\n\nThe first impact was that of American Airlines Flight 11. It was crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan at 8:46 a.m. Seventeen minutes later, at 9:03, the World Trade Center's South Tower was hit by United Airlines Flight 175. Both 110-story skyscrapers collapsed within an hour and forty-one minutes, bringing about the destruction of the remaining five structures in the WTC complex, as well as damaging or destroying various other buildings surrounding the towers. A third flight, American Airlines Flight 77, crashed into the Pentagon at 9:37 a.m., causing a partial collapse. The fourth and final flight, United Airlines Flight 93, flew in the direction of Washington, D.C. Alerted to the previous attacks, the plane's passengers attempted to gain control of the aircraft, but the hijackers ultimately crashed the plane in a field in Stonycreek Township, Pennsylvania, near Shanksville at 10:03 a.m. Investigators determined that Flight 93 target was either the United States Capitol or the White House.\n\nWithin hours of the attacks, the Central Intelligence Agency determined that al-Qaeda was responsible. The United States formally responded by launching the war on terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had not complied with U.S. demands to expel al-Qaeda from Afghanistan and extradite its leader, Osama bin Laden. The U.S.'s invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty\u2014its only usage to date\u2014called upon allies to fight al-Qaeda. As U.S. and NATO ground forces swept through Afghanistan, bin Laden fled to the White Mountains, where he narrowly avoided capture by U.S.-led forces. Although bin Laden initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he formally claimed responsibility for the attacks. Al-Qaeda's cited motivations included U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, and sanctions against Iraq. After evading capture for almost a decade, bin Laden was killed by the U.S. military on May 2, 2011. U.S. and NATO troops remained in Afghanistan until 2021.\n\nThe attacks resulted in 2,977 non-hijacker fatalities, an indeterminate number of injuries, and substantial long-term health consequences, in addition to at least $10 billion in infrastructure and property damage.

The destruction of the World Trade Center and its environs seriously harmed the New York City economy and induced global market shocks. Many other countries strengthened anti-terrorism legislation and expanded their powers of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

Founded on 14 September 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela), it has, since 1965, been headquartered in Vienna, Austria, although Austria is not an OPEC member state. As of September 2018, the 13 member countries accounted for an estimated 44 percent of global oil production and 81.5 percent of the world's proven oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by the so-called \"Seven Sisters\" grouping of multinational oil companies.\n\nThe formation of OPEC marked a turning point toward national sovereignty over natural resources, and OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil market and international relations. The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and in the revenue and wealth of OPEC, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. In the 1980s, OPEC began setting production targets for its member nations; generally, when the targets are reduced, oil prices increase. This has occurred most recently from the organization's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply.\n\nEconomists have characterized OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel that cooperates to reduce market competition, but one whose consultations are protected by the doctrine of state immunity under international law. In the 1960s and 1970s, OPEC successfully restructured the global oil production system so that decision-making authority and the vast majority of profits is in the hands of oil-producing countries. Since the 1980s, OPEC has had a limited impact on world oil supply and price stability, as there is frequent cheating by members on their commitments to one another, and as member commitments reflect what they would do even in the absence of OPEC.\n\nCurrent OPEC members are Algeria, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Meanwhile, Ecuador, Indonesia and Qatar are former OPEC members.

The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth observers being in a rotating reference frame; this apparent motion caused many cultures to have mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model, which prevailed until astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus formulated his heliocentric model in the 16th century.\nAstronomically, sunrise occurs for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon. However, the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point:\nTwilight, the period in the morning during which the sky is brightening, but the Sun is not yet visible. The beginning of morning twilight is called astronomical dawn.\nThe period after the Sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen.\nThe timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and is also affected by the viewer's latitude and longitude, altitude, and time zone. These changes are driven by the axial tilt of Earth, daily rotation of the Earth, the planet's movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the Sun, and the Earth and Moon's paired revolutions around each other. The analemma can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise.\nIn late winter and spring, sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day, reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice; although the exact date varies by latitude. After this point, the time of sunrise gets later each day, reaching its latest sometime around the winter solstice. The offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis, and is described by the analemma, which can be used to predict the dates.\nVariations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position. Near the poles, the time-of-day variation is exaggerated, since the Sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly.\nAccounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of day relative to night. The sunrise equation, however, which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset, uses the Sun's physical center for calculation, neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc.", "response": "In late winter and spring, sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day, reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice; although the exact date varies by latitude.

Severus was declared Caesar by the Senate, but Pescennius Niger was hostile when he declared himself emperor. This started the civil war between Niger and Severus; both gathered troops and fought throughout the territory of the empire. Due to this war, Severus allowed Clodius Albinus, whom he suspected of being a threat, to be co-Caesar so that Severus did not have to preoccupy himself with imperial governance.

By combining these \"omes\", scientists can analyze complex biological big data to find novel associations between biological entities, pinpoint relevant biomarkers and build elaborate markers of disease and physiology. In doing so, multiomics integrates diverse omics data to find a coherently matching geno-pheno-envirotype relationship or association. The OmicTools service lists more than 99 softwares related to multiomic data analysis, as well as more than 99 databases on the topic.\n\nSystems biology approaches are often based upon the use of panomic analysis data. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) defines panomics as referring to \"the interaction of all biological functions within a cell and with other body functions, combining data collected by targeted tests ... and global assays (such as genome sequencing) with other patient-specific information.\"\n\nSingle-cell multiomics\nA branch of the field of multiomics is the analysis of multilevel single-cell data, called single-cell multiomics. This approach gives us an unprecedent resolution to look at multilevel transitions in health and disease at the single cell level. An advantage in relation to bulk analysis is to mitigate confounding factors derived from cell to cell variation, allowing the uncovering of heterogeneous tissue architectures.\n\nMethods for parallel single-cell genomic and transcriptomic analysis can be based on simultaneous amplification or physical separation of RNA and genomic DNA. They allow insights that cannot be gathered solely from transcriptomic analysis, as RNA data do not contain non-coding genomic regions and information regarding copy-number variation, for example. An extension of this methodology is the integration of single-cell transcriptomes to single-cell methylomes, combining single-cell bisulfite sequencing to single cell RNA-Seq. Other techniques to query the epigenome, as single-cell ATAC-Seq and single-cell Hi-C also exist.\n\nA different, but related, challenge is the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic data. One approach to perform such measurement is to physically separate single-cell lysates in two, processing half for RNA, and half for proteins. The protein content of lysates can be measured by proximity extension assays (PEA), for example, which use DNA-barcoded antibodies. A different approach uses a combination of heavy-metal RNA probes and protein antibodies to adapt mass cytometry for multiomic analysis.\n\nMultiomics and machine learning\nIn parallel to the advances in highthroughput biology, machine learning applications to biomedical data analysis are flourishing. The integration of multi-omics data analysis and machine learning has led to the discovery of new biomarkers. For example, one of the methods of the mixOmics project implements a method based on sparse Partial Least Squares regression for selection of features (putative biomarkers).\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiomics", "response": "The analysis of multilevel single-cell data.

Its founders sought to bring salvation to the poor, destitute, and hungry by meeting both their \"physical and spiritual needs\". It is present in 133 countries, running charity shops, operating shelters for the homeless and disaster relief, and humanitarian aid to developing countries.\n\nThe theology of the Salvation Army is derived from Methodism, although it is distinctive in institution and practice. A distinctive characteristic of the Salvation Army is its use of titles derived from military ranks, such as \"lieutenant\" or \"major\". It does not celebrate the rites of Baptism and Holy Communion. However, the Army's doctrine is aligned with the Wesleyan\u2013Arminian tradition, particularly the holiness movement. The Army's purposes are \"the advancement of the Christian religion... of education, the relief of poverty, and other charitable objects beneficial to society or the community of mankind as a whole\".\n\nThe Army was founded in 1865 in London by one-time Methodist preacher William Booth and his wife Catherine as the East London Christian Mission, and can trace its origins to the Blind Beggar tavern. In 1878, Booth reorganised the mission, becoming its first General and introducing the military structure which has been retained as a matter of tradition. Its highest priority is its Christian principles. The current international leader of The Salvation Army and chief executive officer (CEO) is General Brian Peddle, who was elected by the High Council of The Salvation Army on 3 August 2018.\n\nIn 2011, Charity Watch rated the Salvation Army an \"A\u2212\" to an \"A\", indicating a high level of financial efficiency and organisational transparency.

In addition to community centres and disaster relief, the organisation does work in refugee camps, especially among displaced people in Africa. In the United Kingdom, the Salvation Army is no longer the largest nongovernmental provider of social services; however, it still provides a significant service to people in need.

Early belt-drive turntables were unsuitable for scratching since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear and tear and breakage, as the belt would break from backspinning or scratching. The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic), based in Osaka, Japan. It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests. In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable on the market, and the first in their influential Technics series of turntables.\n\nIn the 1970s, hip hop musicians and club DJs began to use this specialized turntable equipment to move the record back and forth, creating percussive sounds and effects\u2013\"scratching\"\u2013to entertain their dance floor audiences. Whereas the 1940s\u20131960s radio DJs had used back-cueing while listening to the sounds through their headphones, without the audience hearing, with scratching, the DJ intentionally lets the audience hear the sounds that are being created by manipulating the record on the turntable, by directing the output from the turntable to a sound reinforcement system so that the audience can hear the sounds. Scratching was developed by early hip hop DJs from New York City such as Grand Wizzard Theodore, who described scratching as, \"nothing but the back-cueing that you hear in your ear before you push it [the recorded sound] out to the crowd.\" He developed the technique when experimenting with the Technics SL-1200, a direct-drive turntable released by Matsushita in 1972 when he found that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter. Afrika Bambaataa made a similar discovery with the SL-1200 in the 1970s. The Technics SL-1200 went on to become the most widely used turntable for the next several decades.\n\nJamaican-born DJ Kool Herc, who immigrated to New York City, influenced the early development of scratching. Kool Herc developed break-beat DJing, where the breaks of funk songs\u2014being the most danceable part, often featuring percussion\u2014were isolated and repeated for the purpose of all-night dance parties. He was influenced by Jamaican dub music, and developed his turntable techniques using the Technics SL-1100, released in 1971, due to its strong motor, durability, and fidelity.\n\nAlthough previous artists such as writer and poet William S. Burroughs had experimented with the idea of manipulating a reel-to-reel tape manually to make sounds, as with his 1950s recording, \"Sound Piece\"), vinyl scratching as an element of hip hop pioneered the idea of making the sound an integral and rhythmic part of music instead of an uncontrolled noise. Scratching is related to \"scrubbing\" (in terms of audio editing and production) when the reels of an open reel-to-reel tape deck (typically 1/4 inch magnetic audiotape) are gently rotated back and forth while the playback head is live and amplified, to isolate a specific spot on the tape where an editing \"cut\" is to be made. In the 2010s, both scratching and scrubbing can be done on digital audio workstations (DAWs) which are equipped for these techniques.\n\n\nWhere It All Started\n\nDJ Sample of the song \"Where it All Started\"\nProblems playing this file? See media help.\nChristian Marclay was one of the earliest musicians to scratch outside hip hop. In the mid-1970s, Marclay used gramophone records and turntables as musical instruments to create sound collages. He developed his turntable sounds independently of hip hop DJs. Although he is little-known to mainstream audiences, Marclay has been described as \"the most influential turntable figure outside hip hop\" and the \"unwitting inventor of turntablism.\"\n\nIn 1981 Grandmaster Flash released the song \"The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel\" which is notable for its use of many DJ scratching techniques. It was the first commercial recording produced entirely using turntables. In 1982, Malcolm McLaren & the World's Famous Supreme Team released a single \"Buffalo Gals\", juxtaposing extensive scratching with calls from square dancing, and, in 1983, the EP, D'ya Like Scratchin'?, which is entirely focused on scratching. Another 1983 release to prominently feature scratching is Herbie Hancock's Grammy Award-winning single \"Rockit\". This song was also performed live at the 1984 Grammy Awards, and in the documentary film Scratch, the performance is cited by many 1980s-era DJs as their first exposure to scratching. The Street Sounds Electro compilation series which started in 1983 is also notable for early examples of scratching.

Unlike a sales tax imposed at the point of sale, a consumption tax could be structured to be progressive rather than regressive, by using a year end tax return to calculate 'net consumption' during a given tax year, with the return summing all sales of qualified investments and then subtracting all purchases of new qualified investments. The tax return then apply a progressive tax rate to the total net investment. Much of the complexity of the current tax code would be eliminated. There would no longer be a need for complex calculations relating to capital gains, based on the concept of 'tax basis' and other arcane notions. Complexities relating to tax beneficial retirement-related savings accounts would also become unnecessary. Investors would no longer be penalized for efficiency-driven portfolio rebalancing. Billionaires would not be taxed significantly if they live frugally, but they could be taxed at very high rates for substantial consumption. A billionaire who buys large yachts, multiple mega-mansions, etc. would pay high taxes. A billionaire who lives modestly would not. But the latter billionaire is keeping her money invested in the economy, providing resources that will further economic growth. Opponents of a consumption tax cite the fact that most consumption taxes are thought to be regressive. However, as perviously mentioned, the consumption tax could be structured to be progressive, and in fact could be structured to be even more progressive than the current income tax. The progressive rates could be based on wealth rather than the amount of annual consumption or income. It would even be possible to tax consumption at over 100% in the case of billionaires. For example, if someone had a net worth of over $10 billion, we could tax that person's consumption at 150%. Regressiveness concerns can also be addressed by exempting a large portion of consumption.

Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions. Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of uranium and plutonium in nuclear power plants. Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators in some space probes such as Voyager 2. Generating electricity from fusion power remains the focus of international research.\n\nMost nuclear power plants use thermal reactors with enriched uranium in a once-through fuel cycle. Fuel is removed when the percentage of neutron absorbing atoms becomes so large that a chain reaction can no longer be sustained, typically three years. It is then cooled for several years in on-site spent fuel pools before being transferred to long term storage. The spent fuel, though low in volume, is high-level radioactive waste. While its radioactivity decreases exponentially it must be isolated from the biosphere for hundreds of thousands of years, though newer technologies (like fast reactors) have the potential to reduce this significantly. Because the spent fuel is still mostly fissionable material, some countries (e.g. France and Russia) reprocess their spent fuel by extracting fissile and fertile elements for fabrication in new fuel, although this process is more expensive than producing new fuel from mined uranium. All reactors breed some plutonium-239, which is found in the spent fuel, and because Pu-239 is the preferred material for nuclear weapons, reprocessing is seen as a weapon proliferation risk.", "response": "Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions.", "category": "information_extraction"}, {"instruction": "How does an umpire signal that a batter has been dismissed in a cricket match ?", "context": "The match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two official scorers, one representing each team.

The company's subsequent bankruptcy was widely blamed on reduced sales after the announcement.\nThe Osborne Effect states that prematurely discussing future, unavailable products damages sales of existing products. The name comes from the planned replacement of the Osborne 1, an early personal computer first sold by the Osborne Computer Corporation in 1981. In 1983, founder Adam Osborne pre-announced several next-generation computer models (the Osborne Executive and Osborne Vixen), which were only prototypes, highlighting the fact that they would outperform the existing model as the prototypes dramatically cut down assembly time. A widely held belief was that sales of the Osborne 1 fell sharply as customers anticipated those more advanced systems, leading to a sales decline from which Osborne Computer was unable to recover. This belief appeared in the media almost immediately after the company's September 1983 bankruptcy:\n\nTo give the jazzy $2,495 Osborne Executive a running start, Adam began orchestrating publicity early in 1983. We, along with many other magazines, were shown the machine in locked hotel rooms. We were required not to have anything in print about it until the planned release date in mid-April. As far as we know, nothing did appear in print, but dealers heard about the plans and cancelled orders for the Osborne 1 in droves. In early April, Osborne told dealers he would be showing them the machine on a one-week tour the week of 17 April, and emphasized that the new machine was not a competitor for the Osborne 1. But dealers didn't react the way Osborne expected; said Osborne, \"All of them just cancelled their orders for the Osborne 1.\"\n\nOsborne reacted by drastically cutting prices on the Osborne 1 in an effort to stimulate cash flow. But nothing seemed to work, and for several months sales were practically non-existent.\n\nPre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, with the revenue drop for the current product being offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available. However, when the Osborne effect occurs, the quantity of unsold goods increases and the company must react by discounting and/or lowering production of the current product, both of which depress cash flow.", "response": "The Osborne effect is a social phenomenon of customers canceling or deferring orders for the current but soon-to-be-obsolete product.

Metric spaces are the most general setting for studying many of the concepts of mathematical analysis and geometry.\n\nThe most familiar example of a metric space is 3-dimensional Euclidean space with its usual notion of distance. Other well-known examples are a sphere equipped with the angular distance and the hyperbolic plane. A metric may correspond to a metaphorical, rather than physical, notion of distance: for example, the set of 100-character Unicode strings can be equipped with the Hamming distance, which measures the number of characters that need to be changed to get from one string to another.\n\nSince they are very general, metric spaces are a tool used in many different branches of mathematics. Many types of mathematical objects have a natural notion of distance and therefore admit the structure of a metric space, including Riemannian manifolds, normed vector spaces, and graphs. In abstract algebra, the p-adic numbers arise as elements of the completion of a metric structure on the rational numbers. Metric spaces are also studied in their own right in metric geometry and analysis on metric spaces.\n\nMany of the basic notions of mathematical analysis, including balls, completeness, as well as uniform, Lipschitz, and H\u00f6lder continuity, can be defined in the setting of metric spaces. Other notions, such as continuity, compactness, and open and closed sets, can be defined for metric spaces, but also in the even more general setting of topological spaces.", "response": "The third metric or distance function that was encountered in this example is the Hamming distance.

A spokesman for the Nation of Islam until 1964, he was a vocal advocate for Black empowerment and the promotion of Islam within the Black community. A posthumous autobiography, on which he collaborated with Alex Haley, was published in 1965.\n\nMalcolm spent his adolescence living in a series of foster homes or with relatives after his father's death and his mother's hospitalization. He committed various crimes, being sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1946 for larceny and burglary. In prison he joined the Nation of Islam (adopting the name Malcolm X to symbolize his unknown African ancestral surname while discarding \"the White slavemaster name of 'Little'\"), and after his parole in 1952 quickly became one of the organization's most influential leaders. He was the public face of the organization for 12 years, advocating Black empowerment and separation of Black and White Americans, and criticizing Martin Luther King Jr. and the mainstream civil rights movement for its emphasis on nonviolence and racial integration. Malcolm X also expressed pride in some of the Nation's social welfare achievements, such as its free drug rehabilitation program. From the 1950s onward, Malcolm X was subjected to surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nIn the 1960s, Malcolm X began to grow disillusioned with the Nation of Islam, as well as with its leader, Elijah Muhammad. He subsequently embraced Sunni Islam and the civil rights movement after completing the Hajj to Mecca, and became known as \"el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz,\" which roughly translates to \"The Pilgrim Malcolm the Patriarch\". After a brief period of travel across Africa, he publicly renounced the Nation of Islam and founded the Islamic Muslim Mosque, Inc. (MMI) and the Pan-African Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU). Throughout 1964, his conflict with the Nation of Islam intensified, and he was repeatedly sent death threats. On February 21, 1965, he was assassinated in New York City. Three Nation members were charged with the murder and given indeterminate life sentences; in 2021, two of the convictions were vacated. Speculation about the assassination and whether it was conceived or aided by leading or additional members of the Nation, or with law enforcement agencies, has persisted for decades.\n\nA controversial figure accused of preaching racism and violence, Malcolm X is also a widely celebrated figure within African-American and Muslim American communities for his pursuit of racial justice.

The vast majority of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war.\n\nWorld War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history; it resulted in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\n\nThe causes of World War II are debated, but contributing factors included the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Spanish Civil War, Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet\u2013Japanese border conflicts, the rise of fascism in Europe, and European tensions in the aftermath of World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their \"spheres of influence\" across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, in a military alliance with Italy, Japan and other countries called the Axis. Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the United Kingdom, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history.\n\nJapan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with the Republic of China by 1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor which resulted in the United States and United Kingdom declaring war against Japan. The European Axis powers declared war on the United States in solidarity. Japan soon captured much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943\u2014including a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific\u2014cost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and pushed Germany and its allies back. During 1944 and 1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key western Pacific islands.\n\nThe war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories and the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the Fall of Berlin to Soviet troops, Hitler's suicide, and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the Potsdam Declaration (issued 26 July 1945), the United States dropped the first atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima on 6 August and Nagasaki on 9 August. Faced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet Union's declared entry into the war against Japan on the eve of invading Manchuria, Japan announced on 10 August its intention to surrender, signing a surrender document on 2 September 1945.\n\nWorld War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe and set the foundation for the international order of the world's nations during the Cold War and into present day. The United Nations was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts, with the victorious great powers\u2014China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014becoming the permanent members of its Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion.

Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures.\n\nA mass spectrum is a type of plot of the ion signal as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. These spectra are used to determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample, the masses of particles and of molecules, and to elucidate the chemical identity or structure of molecules and other chemical compounds.\n\nIn a typical MS procedure, a sample, which may be solid, liquid, or gaseous, is ionized, for example by bombarding it with a beam of electrons. This may cause some of the sample's molecules to break up into positively charged fragments or simply become positively charged without fragmenting. These ions (fragments) are then separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio, for example by accelerating them and subjecting them to an electric or magnetic field: ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will undergo the same amount of deflection. The ions are detected by a mechanism capable of detecting charged particles, such as an electron multiplier. Results are displayed as spectra of the signal intensity of detected ions as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio.

The process was completed in the 13th century when the Principality of Wales became a client state of the English kingdom. Meanwhile, Magna Carta began the process of reducing the English monarch's political powers. In the 16th century, English and Scottish monarchs played a central role in what became the religious English Reformation and Scottish Reformation. From 1603, the English and Scottish kingdoms were ruled by a single sovereign. From 1649 to 1660, the tradition of monarchy was broken by the republican Commonwealth of England, which followed the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Following the installation of William III and Mary II as co-monarchs in the Glorious Revolution, the Bill of Rights 1689, and its Scottish counterpart the Claim of Right Act 1689, further curtailed the power of the monarchy and excluded Roman Catholics from succession to the throne. In 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to create the Kingdom of Great Britain, and in 1801, the Kingdom of Ireland joined to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\u200a\nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.", "response": "Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish.

The difference is that ultimate frisbee is a team sport that combines several of the rules of football, basketball and soccer. Like football, a team takes possession of the frisbee and tries to move it down field and into an end zone. Like basketball, once you are in possession of the frisbee, you cannot move your pivot foot. However, there is no \"dribbling\" with a frisbee so if a player has possession of the frisbee outside of their end zone, they have to pass it before they can move their pivot foot. Ultimate frisbee is played on a soccer field and the player movement looks most like that sport. Frisbee golf, on the other hand, follows the rules of golf, except that the player throws a frisbee to the hole instead of hitting a ball with clubs. Some people play the sport on dedicated frisbee golf courses, using a set of specialized discs of various weights and carrying them in a bag from hole to hole like a golfer would do with their set of clubs. Others simply take a standard 175-gram frisbee and make up a course as they go.

Unwin rejected this proposal, calling the draft obscure and \"too Celtic\", so Tolkien began working on a new story that eventually became The Lord of the Rings.\n\nThe Silmarillion has five parts. The first, Ainulindal\u00eb, tells in mythic style of the creation of E\u00e4, the \"world that is.\" The second part, Valaquenta, gives a description of the Valar and Maiar, supernatural powers of E\u00e4. The next section, Quenta Silmarillion, which forms the bulk of the collection, chronicles the history of the events before and during the First Age, including the wars over three jewels, the Silmarils, that gave the book its title. The fourth part, Akallab\u00eath, relates the history of the Downfall of N\u00famenor and its people, which takes place in the Second Age. The final part, Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age, is a brief summary of the events of The Lord of the Rings and those that led to them.\n\nThe book shows the influence of many sources, including the Finnish epic Kalevala, Greek mythology in the lost island of Atlantis (as N\u00famenor) and the Olympian gods (in the shape of the Valar, though these also resemble the Norse \u00c6sir).\n\nBecause J. R. R. Tolkien died leaving his legendarium unedited, Christopher Tolkien selected and edited materials to tell the story from start to end. In a few cases, this meant that he had to devise completely new material, within the tenor of his father's thought, to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in the narrative, particularly Chapter 22, \"Of the Ruin of Doriath\".\n\nThe Silmarillion received a generally poor reception on publication. Scholars found the work problematic, not least because the book is a construction, not authorised by Tolkien himself, from the large corpus of documents and drafts also called \"The Silmarillion\". Scholars have noted that Tolkien intended the work to be a mythology, penned by many hands, and redacted by a fictional editor, whether \u00c6lfwine or Bilbo Baggins.

Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learnt of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies. Coffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee.

Three years later, he became the head of a section in it. He published two poetry books: Falenas, in 1870, and Americanas, in 1875. Their weak reception made him explore other literary genres.\n\nHe wrote five romantic novels: Ressurrei\u00e7\u00e3o, A M\u00e3o e a Luva, Helena and Iai\u00e1 Garcia. The books were a success with the public, but literary critics considered them mediocre. Machado suffered repeated attacks of epilepsy, apparently related to hearing of the death of his old friend Jos\u00e9 de Alencar. He was left melancholic, pessimistic and fixed on death. His next book, marked by \"a skeptical and realistic tone\": Mem\u00f3rias P\u00f3stumas de Br\u00e1s Cubas (Posthumous Memoirs of Br\u00e1s Cubas, also translated as Epitaph of a Small Winner), is widely considered a masterpiece. By the end of the 1880s, Machado had gained wide renown as a writer.\n\nAlthough he was opposed to slavery, he never spoke against it in public. He avoided discussing politics. He was criticized by the abolitionist Jos\u00e9 do Patroc\u00ednio and by the writer Lima Barreto for staying away from politics, especially the cause of abolition. He was also criticized by them for having married a white woman. Machado was caught by surprise with the monarchy overthrown on 15 November 1889. Machado had no sympathy towards republicanism, as he considered himself a liberal monarchist and venerated Pedro II, whom he perceived as \"a humble, honest, well-learned and patriotic man, who knew how to make of a throne a chair [for his simplicity], without diminishing its greatness and respect.\" When a commission went to the public office where he worked to remove the picture of the former emperor, the shy Machado defied them: \"The picture got in here by an order and it shall leave only by another order.\"\n\nThe birth of the Brazilian republic made Machado become more critical and an observer of the Brazilian society of his time. From then on, he wrote \"not only the greatest novels of his time, but the greatest of all time of Brazilian literature.\" Works such as Quincas Borba (Philosopher or Dog?) (1891), Dom Casmurro (1899), Esa\u00fa e Jac\u00f3 (1904) and Memorial de Aires (1908), considered masterpieces, were successes with both critics and the public.

The family travelled widely in Europe, including Spain. On his return to Argentina in 1921, Borges began publishing his poems and essays in surrealist literary journals. He also worked as a librarian and public lecturer. In 1955, he was appointed director of the National Public Library and professor of English Literature at the University of Buenos Aires. He became completely blind by the age of 55. Scholars have suggested that his progressive blindness helped him to create innovative literary symbols through imagination.[Note 1] By the 1960s, his work was translated and published widely in the United States and Europe. Borges himself was fluent in several languages.\n\nIn 1961, he came to international attention when he received the first Formentor Prize, which he shared with Samuel Beckett. In 1971, he won the Jerusalem Prize. His international reputation was consolidated in the 1960s, aided by the growing number of English translations, the Latin American Boom, and by the success of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude.

The Abbasid caliphs gave the title wazir to a minister formerly called katib (secretary), who was at first merely a helper but afterwards became the representative and successor of the dapir (official scribe or secretary) of the Sassanian kings.\n\nIn modern usage, the term has been used for government ministers in much of the Middle East and beyond.\n\nSeveral alternative spellings are used in English, such as vizir, wazir, and vezir.\n\nVizier is suggested to be an Iranian word, from the Pahlavi root of vi\u010dir, which originally had the meaning of a decree, mandate, and command, but later as its use in Dinkard also suggests, came to mean judge or magistrate. Arthur Jeffery considers the word to be a \"good Iranian\" word, as it has a well-established root in Avestan language. The Pahlavi vi\u010dir, is in fact from the Avestan v\u012b\u010dira, which means deciding. This Avestan root is behind the Modern Persian form of the word which is ve\u010der which means judge. This etymology is also supported by Johnny Cheung and Richard Nelson Frye\n\nAnother possibility is that the etymology of the word is derived from the Arabic wazara (\"to bear a burden\"), from the Semitic root W-Z-R. The word is mentioned in the Quran, where Aaron is described as the wazir (helper) of Moses, as well as the word wizr (burden) which is also derived from the same root. It was later adopted as a title, in the form of waz\u012br \u0101l Mu\u1e25ammad (\"Helper of the Family of Muhammad\") by the proto-Shi'a leaders al-Mukhtar and Abu Salama.

Its major conclusion is that social welfare provisions are larger and income inequality lower in countries where working-class people are more politically organized.\n\nWhile power resource theory became the dominant paradigm among scholars in the 1990s for explaining variations between welfare states in advanced democracies, there are criticisms that point out the lack of accountability for factors such as variations in \u201ccoverage, extension, and generosity among welfare states\u201d in addition to not accounting for the importance of political mobilization based on social class.

To observe other parts of the spectrum - ultraviolet, x-rays, gamma rays or infrared, telescopes have to be outside of Earth's atmosphere. Studying gamma-rays for example, helps astronomers learn more about things like blazars, gamma-ray bursts, pulsars and solar flares than would be possible with just optical telescopes. Similarly, studying x-rays gives invaluable information about the very hot regions of the universe such as exploded stars, clusters of galaxies, and the matter around black holes.

While many other countries may put safety first, the harsh reality for Americans is that freedom always comes before safety. Despite being equally important, Americans foolishly put their trust in freedom over safety, without realizing the dangers of those freedoms.\nThe 2nd Amendment is a commonly danger to freedom. Americans are allowed to own guns for self protection. However, since the 18th century, guns have changed. Instead of a rifle or shotgun, Americans own ARI5s and other guns that can fire hundreds of bullets per round. Security in America has also increased leaving people to question the need for a personal weapon.\nOften a result of having the freedom to easily buy and keep guns is school shootings. Teens who are depressed, lonely, suicidal, or crazy can easily buy or ise their parents guns to shoot and will other students, teachers, or themselves. In late 2022, a six year old brought his father's hand gun to school and shot his teacher. Yes, the gun was licensed and own by the father but why should any US citizen or even person feel safe in this country when the 2nd Amendment exsits? Should anyone trust their freedoms when it is easier to buy a gun than a car?\nOn the flip side, America's freedom is a gift that many other countries don't give. In 2019 when covid-19 first immerged in China, the country. went on lockdown, and in some cities, still remains so.

Indeed, Werther is often considered to be the \"spark\" which ignited the movement, and can arguably be called the world's first \"best-seller\". During the years at Weimar before he met Schiller in 1794, he began Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship and wrote the dramas Iphigenie auf Tauris (Iphigenia in Tauris), Egmont, and Torquato Tasso and the fable Reineke Fuchs.To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the conception of Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years (the continuation of Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship), the idyll of Hermann and Dorothea, the Roman Elegies and the verse drama The Natural Daughter. In the last period, between Schiller's death, in 1805, and his own, appeared Faust Part One (1808), Elective Affinities (1809), the West-Eastern Diwan (an 1819 collection of poems in the Persian style, influenced by the work of Hafez), his autobiographical Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahrheit (From My Life: Poetry and Truth, published between 1811 and 1833) which covers his early life and ends with his departure for Weimar, his Italian Journey (1816\u201317), and a series of treatises on art.

Please give the main core idea of Transformer described in this paper", "context": "A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV).\n\nLike recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to process sequential input data, such as natural language, with applications towards tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers process the entire input all at once. The attention mechanism provides context for any position in the input sequence. For example, if the input data is a natural language sentence, the transformer does not have to process one word at a time. This allows for more parallelization than RNNs and therefore reduces training times.\n\nTransformers were introduced in 2017 by a team at Google Brain and are increasingly becoming the model of choice for NLP problems, replacing RNN models such as long short-term memory (LSTM). The additional training parallelization allows training on larger datasets. This led to the development of pretrained systems such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which were trained with large language datasets, such as the Wikipedia Corpus and Common Crawl, and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.", "response": "This paper is by Vaswani, Ashish & Shazeer, Noam & Parmar, Niki & Uszkoreit, Jakob & Jones, Llion & Gomez, Aidan & Kaiser, Lukasz & Polosukhin, Illia. and published in 2017.

The main core architecture of the Transformer model includes: Self-Attention Mechanism, Positional Encoding, Encoder-Decoder Architecture, Multi-Head Attension.\nTransformer effectively solves the difficult parallel problem of the previous RNN/LSTM model by using the Attention mechanism. Using Self-Attention solves the problem of limited labeled data in NLP. The sequence information in the input text is preserved through Positional Encoding.

As for the type of exercise, we can assess the options that are available and feasible for Roslyn to perform, and choose between weight-bearing exercises (such as walking or jogging) and non-weight-bearing exercises such as swimming or rowing. Another thing to consider is that Roslyn is sedentary, and may need to slowly progress into a more intense workout.

Large reviews of theories of defence mechanisms are available from Paulhus, Fridhandler and Hayes (1997) and Cramer (1991). The Journal of Personality published a special issue on defence mechanisms (1998).\n\nIn the first definitive book on defence mechanisms, The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence (1936), Anna Freud enumerated the ten defence mechanisms that appear in the works of her father, Sigmund Freud: repression, regression, reaction formation, isolation, undoing, projection, introjection, turning against one's own person, reversal into the opposite, and sublimation or displacement.\n\nSigmund Freud posited that defence mechanisms work by distorting id impulses into acceptable forms, or by unconscious or conscious blockage of these impulses. Anna Freud considered defense mechanisms as intellectual and motor automatisms of various degrees of complexity, that arose in the process of involuntary and voluntary learning.\n\nAnna Freud introduced the concept of signal anxiety; she stated that it was \"not directly a conflicted instinctual tension but a signal occurring in the ego of an anticipated instinctual tension\". The signalling function of anxiety was thus seen as crucial, and biologically adapted to warn the organism of danger or a threat to its equilibrium. The anxiety is felt as an increase in bodily or mental tension, and the signal that the organism receives in this way allows for the possibility of taking defensive action regarding the perceived danger.\n\nBoth Freuds studied defence mechanisms, but Anna spent more of her time and research on five main mechanisms: repression, regression, projection, reaction formation, and sublimation. All defence mechanisms are responses to anxiety and how the consciousness and unconscious manage the stress of a social situation.\n\nRepression: when a feeling is hidden and forced from the consciousness to the unconscious because it is seen as socially unacceptable\nRegression: falling back into an early state of mental/physical development seen as \"less demanding and safer\"\nProjection: possessing a feeling that is deemed as socially unacceptable and instead of facing it, that feeling or \"unconscious urge\" is seen in the actions of other people\nReaction formation: acting the opposite way that the unconscious instructs a person to behave, \"often exaggerated and obsessive\". For example, if a wife is infatuated with a man who is not her husband, reaction formation may cause her to \u2013 rather than cheat \u2013 become obsessed with showing her husband signs of love and affection.\nSublimation: seen as the most acceptable of the mechanisms, an expression of anxiety in socially acceptable ways\nOtto F. Kernberg (1967) developed a theory of borderline personality organization of which one consequence may be borderline personality disorder. His theory is based on ego psychological object relations theory. Borderline personality organization develops when the child cannot integrate helpful and harmful mental objects together. Kernberg views the use of primitive defence mechanisms as central to this personality organization. Primitive psychological defences are projection, denial, dissociation or splitting and they are called borderline defence mechanisms. Also, devaluation and projective identification are seen as borderline defences.\n\nIn George Eman Vaillant's (1977) categorization, defences form a continuum related to their psychoanalytical developmental level.[non-primary source needed] They are classified into pathological, immature, neurotic and \"mature\" defences.\n\nRobert Plutchik's (1979) theory views defences as derivatives of basic emotions, which in turn relate to particular diagnostic structures. According to his theory, reaction formation relates to joy (and manic features), denial relates to acceptance (and histrionic features), repression to fear (and passivity), regression to surprise (and borderline traits), compensation to sadness (and depression), projection to disgust (and paranoia), displacement to anger (and hostility) and intellectualization to anticipation (and obsessionality).\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) published by the American Psychiatric Association (1994) includes a tentative diagnostic axis for defence mechanisms. This classification is largely based on Vaillant's hierarchical view of defences, but has some modifications. Examples include: denial, fantasy, rationalization, regression, isolation, projection, and displacement.", "response": "There are multiple definitions of defense mechanism based on different theories.

Forty-nine catalog pages with pictures, diagrams and descriptions of espionage devices and spying software were published. The items are available to the Tailored Access Operations unit and are mostly targeted at products from US companies such as Apple, Cisco and Dell. The source is believed to be someone different than Edward Snowden, who is largely responsible for the global surveillance disclosures since 2013. Companies whose products could be compromised have denied any collaboration with the NSA in developing these capabilities. In 2014, a project was started to implement the capabilities from the ANT catalog as open-source hardware and software.\n\nBackground\nThe Tailored Access Operations unit has existed since the late 90s. Its mission is to collect intelligence on foreign targets of the United States by hacking into computers and telecommunication networks.\n\nIn 2012, Edward Snowden organized a CryptoParty together with Runa Sandvik, a former colleague of Jacob Appelbaum at The Tor Project. In June 2013, Snowden took internal NSA documents which he shared with Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, resulting in the global surveillance disclosures. It has been speculated for years before that capabilities like those in the ANT catalog existed.\n\nPublication\nJacob Appelbaum co-authored the English publication in Der Spiegel with Christian St\u00f6cker  and Judith Horchert, which was publicized on 29 December 2013. The related English publication on the same day about the TAO by Der Spiegel was also authored by the same people, and including Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach, J\u00f6rg Schindler and Holger Stark. On December 30, Appelbaum gave a lecture about \"the militarization of the Internet\" at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, Germany. At the end of his talk, he encouraged NSA employees to leak more documents.\n\nApple denied the allegations that it collaborated on the development of DROPOUTJEEP in a statement to journalist Arik Hesseldahl from All Things Digital (part of the Wall Street Journal's Digital Network). The Verge questioned how the program developed in later years, since the document was composed in the early period of the iPhone and smartphones in general. Dell denied collaborating with any government in general, including the US government. John Stewart, senior vice president and chief security officer of Cisco stated that they were \"deeply concerned and will continue to pursue all avenues to determine if we need to address any new issues.\" Juniper stated that they were working actively to address any possible exploit paths. Huawei stated they would take appropriate audits to determine if any compromise had taken place and would communicate if that had taken place. NSA declined to comment on the publication by Der Spiegel.\n\nSource\nThe source who leaked the ANT catalog to the press is unknown as of 2023.\n\nAuthor James Bamford, who is specialized in the United States intelligence agencies, noted in a commentary article published by Reuters that Appelbaum has not identified the source who leaked the ANT catalog to him, which led people to mistakenly assume it was Edward Snowden. Bamford got unrestricted access to the documents cache from Edward Snowden and could not find any references to the ANT catalog using automated search tools, thereby concluding that the documents were not leaked by him. Security expert Bruce Schneier has stated on his blog that he also believes the ANT catalog did not come from Snowden, but from a second leaker. Officials at the NSA did not believe that the web crawler used by Snowden touched the ANT catalog and started looking for other people who could have leaked the catalog.\n\nContent\nThe published catalog pages were written between 2008 and 2009.

It was developed by statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini.\nThe Gini coefficient measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution, such as levels of income. A Gini coefficient of 0 reflects perfect equality, where all income or wealth values are the same, while a Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) reflects maximal inequality among values. For example, if everyone has the same income, the Gini coefficient will be 0. In contrast, a Gini coefficient of 1 indicates that within a group of people, a single individual has all the income or consumption, while all others have none.\nThe Gini coefficient was proposed by Corrado Gini as a measure of inequality of income or wealth.  For OECD countries, in the late 20th century, considering the effect of taxes and transfer payments, the income Gini coefficient ranged between 0.24 and 0.49, with Slovenia being the lowest and Mexico the highest.

The downward force on the object is simply its weight. The upward, or buoyant, force on the object is that stated by Archimedes' principle above. Thus, the net force on the object is the difference between the magnitudes of the buoyant force and its weight. If this net force is positive, the object rises; if negative, the object sinks; and if zero, the object is neutrally buoyant\u2014that is, it remains in place without either rising or sinking. In simple words, Archimedes' principle states that, when a body is partially or completely immersed in a fluid, it experiences an apparent loss in weight that is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the immersed part of the body(s).\n\nConsider a cuboid immersed in a fluid, its top and bottom faces orthogonal to the direction of gravity (assumed constant across the cube's stretch). The fluid will exert a normal force on each face, but only the normal forces on top and bottom will contribute to buoyancy. The pressure difference between the bottom and the top face is directly proportional to the height (difference in depth of submersion). Multiplying the pressure difference by the area of a face gives a net force on the cuboid\u200a\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2014\u200a\u200athe buoyancy\u200a\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2014\u200a\u200aequaling in size the weight of the fluid displaced by the cuboid.

The weight of the object in the fluid is reduced, because of the force acting on it, which is called upthrust. In simple terms, the principle states that the buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object, or the density of the fluid multiplied by the submerged volume times the gravity.", "response": "When you immerse an object under water, it pushes the water away in order to take its place.\nThe water wants to get back to where it was before and pushes the object away, towards the surface.\nThen it depends what is the weight of the object, compared with how much water was moved.\nImagine you could put your object on one side of a balance, and on the other side, you would duplicate your object and transform it into water (representing how much water is moved if you were to plunge put your object under water).\nIf your original object is lighter than its equivalent in water, like a bubble for example, or a balloon, the water will be strong enough to have the object to float.\nIf the object is heavier than its equivalent water, like a bowling ball, or a rock, the water will not be able to push hard enough, and the object will sink.", "category": "summarization"}, {"instruction": "What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?", "context": "", "response": "42", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "can you recommend fun activities to enjoy in Austin in summer?", "context": "", "response": "Summer can be hot in Austin, with historical highest temperatures went above 100 Farheiths.

Uber's response to California Assembly Bill 5 (2019), whereby it announced that it would not comply with the law, then engaged lobbyists and mounted an expensive public opinion campaign to overturn it via a ballot, was cited as an example of this policy. Taxi companies sued Uber in numerous American cities, alleging that Uber's policy of violating taxi regulations was a form of unfair competition or a violation of antitrust law. Although some courts did find that Uber intentionally violated the taxi rules, Uber prevailed in every case, including the only case to proceed to trial.\n\nIn March 2017, an investigation by The New York Times revealed that Uber developed a software tool called \"Greyball\" to avoid giving rides to known law enforcement officers in areas where its service was illegal such as in Portland, Oregon, Australia, South Korea, and China. The tool identified government officials using geofencing, mining credit card databases, identifying devices, and searches of social media. While at first, Uber stated that it only used the tool to identify riders that violated its terms of service, after investigations by Portland, Oregon, and the United States Department of Justice, Uber admitted to using the tool to skirt local regulations and promised not to use the tool for that purpose. The use of Greyball in London was cited by Transport for London as one of the reasons for its decision not to renew Uber's private hire operator licence in September 2017. A January 2018 report by Bloomberg News stated that Uber routinely used a \"panic button\" system, codenamed \"Ripley\", that locked, powered off and changed passwords on staff computers when those offices were subjected to government raids. Uber allegedly used this button at least 24 times, from spring 2015 until late 2016.\n\nCounter-intelligence research on class action plaintiffs\nIn 2016 Uber hired the global security consulting firm Ergo to secretly investigate plaintiffs involved in a class action lawsuit. Ergo operatives posed as acquaintances of the plaintiff's counsel and tried to contact their associates to obtain information that could be used against them. The result of which was found out causing the judge to throw out evidence obtained as obtained in a fraudulent manner.\n\nSexual harassment allegations and management shakeup (2017)\nOn February 19, 2017, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler published on her website that she was propositioned for sex by a manager and subsequently threatened with termination of employment by another manager if she continued to report the incident. Kalanick was alleged to have been aware of the complaint. On February 27, 2017, Amit Singhal, Uber's Senior Vice President of Engineering, was forced to resign after he failed to disclose a sexual harassment claim against him that occurred while he served as Vice President of Google Search. After investigations led by former attorney general Eric Holder and Arianna Huffington, a member of Uber's board of directors, in June 2017, Uber fired over 20 employees. Kalanick took an indefinite leave of absence but, under pressure from investors, he resigned as CEO a week later. Also departing the company in June 2017 was Emil Michael, a senior vice president who suggested that Uber hire a team of opposition researchers and journalists, with a million-dollar budget, to \"dig up dirt\" on the personal lives and backgrounds of journalists who reported negatively on Uber, specifically targeting Sarah Lacy, editor of PandoDaily, who, in an article published in October 2014, accused Uber of sexism and misogyny in its advertising. In August 2018, Uber agreed to pay a total of $7 million to settle claims of gender discrimination, harassment, and hostile work environment, with 480 employees and former employees receiving $10,700 each and 56 of those employees and former employees receiving an additional $33,900 each. In December 2019, Kalanick resigned from the board of directors of the company and sold his shares.\n\nDelayed disclosure of data breaches\nOn February 27, 2015, Uber admitted that it had suffered a data breach more than nine months prior. Names and license plate information from approximately 50,000 drivers were inadvertently disclosed. Uber discovered this leak in September 2014, but waited more than five months to notify the affected individuals.\n\nAn announcement in November 2017 revealed that in 2016, a separate data breach had disclosed the personal information of 600,000 drivers and 57 million customers. This data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, and drivers' license information. Hackers used employees' usernames and passwords that had been compromised in previous breaches (a \"credential stuffing\" method) to gain access to a private GitHub repository used by Uber's developers. The hackers located credentials for the company's Amazon Web Services datastore in the repository files, and were able to obtain access to the account records of users and drivers, as well as other data contained in over 100 Amazon S3 buckets. Uber paid a $100,000 ransom to the hackers on the promise they would delete the stolen data. Uber was subsequently criticized for concealing this data breach. Khosrowshahi publicly apologized. In September 2018, in the largest multi-state settlement of a data breach, Uber paid $148 million to the Federal Trade Commission, admitted that its claim that internal access to consumers' personal information was closely monitored on an ongoing basis was false, and stated that it had failed to live up to its promise to provide reasonable security for consumer data. Also in November 2018, Uber's British divisions were fined \u00a3385,000 (reduced to \u00a3308,000) by the Information Commissioner's Office.\n\nIn 2020, the US Department of Justice announced criminal charges against former Chief Security Officer Joe Sullivan for obstruction of justice. The criminal complaint said Sullivan arranged, with Kalanick's knowledge, to pay a ransom for the 2016 breach as a \"bug bounty\" to conceal its true nature, and for the hackers to falsify non-disclosure agreements to say they had not obtained any data.", "response": "The following is a summary of the controversies around Uber:\n- Ignoring and Evading Local Regulations: Historically, Uber has launched in new cities without obtaining regulatory approval or following laws\n- Counter-intelligence Research on Class Action Plaintiffs: Uber secretly investigated plaintiffs to obtain information that could be used against them\n- Sexual Harassment Allegations and Management Shakeup:  A former employee published a public letter exposing her experiences being sexually harassed while at Uber.

American football, also known as gridiron, was first played in 1869 in the United States and mostly known in the United States and Canada. It rivals two teams on a rectangular field. Both teams have an offence as well as a defence formation. The first offence and defence of the match is decided by coin tossed where the winner decide for the first half of the match while the opposite match starts at the half-time mark. The offence team tries to take the oval-shaped ball to the other side of the field by passing or running it at each play. The defence team blocks the offence team so they get the balls themselves either by steeling it or when the offence team hasn\u2019t progressed 10 yards in 4 plays. Then, offence team becomes defence and vice versa. When the offence team successfully reach the 10-yard lines, they obtain a new set of 4 plays to get to the endzone, where they obtain points when succeeding, called a touchdown. They also get points from kicking the ball within the goalpost. The winning team is the one with the most points at the end of the game. European football, also known as soccer, is a match between two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field, known as pitch. Players primarily use their feet to propel a sphere-shaped ball across the field into the rectangular shaped goal guarded by a goalkeeper. The goalkeeper is the only player of each team that can use his hands and arms on the ball within a specific region of the field close to their goals.

It is probably named after Robert J. Hanlon, who submitted the statement to Murphy's Law Book Two (1980). Similar statements have been recorded since at least the 18th century.\n\nOrigin\nA similar quotation appears in Robert A. Heinlein's novella Logic of Empire (1941). The character \"Doc\" in Heinlein's story described the \"devil theory\" fallacy, explaining, \"You have attributed conditions to villainy that simply result from stupidity.\"\n\nThe quotation as such was a submission credited in print to Robert J. Hanlon of Scranton, Pennsylvania, for a compilation of various jokes related to Murphy's law that were published in Arthur Bloch's Murphy's Law Book Two: More Reasons Why Things Go Wrong! (1980). It is unknown whether Hanlon knew of Heinlein's story or whether he independently constructed the phrase.[citation needed]\n\nHanlon's razor became well-known after its inclusion in the Jargon File, a glossary of computer programmer slang, since 1990. Later that same year, the Jargon File editors noted lack of knowledge about the term's derivation and the existence of a similar epigram by William James, though this was possibly intended as a reference to William James Laidlay. In 1996, the Jargon File entry on Hanlon's Razor noted the existence of the phrase in Heinlein's novella, with speculation that Hanlon's Razor might be a corruption of \"Heinlein's Razor\". The link to Murphy's law was described in a pair of 2001 blog entries by Quentin Stafford-Fraser, citing emails from Joseph E. Bigler. Subsequently, in 2002, the Jargon File entry noted the same. Current Jargon File refers to it as a \"Murphyism\".\n\nThe name was inspired by Occam's razor.", "response": "Hanlon's razor became well-known after its inclusion in the Jargon File, a glossary of computer programmer slang, since 1990.", "category": "closed_qa"}, {"instruction": "How much money did George Lucas get for selling Lucasfilm to Disney?", "context": "", "response": "$4 billion", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "Given this paragraph about the M26, tell me how many times Hunt finished in the top 3, and explain your reasoning.", "context": "McLaren relied on the M23 during the rest of the season and for the first few races of 1977 until it was deemed necessary that the M26 was to race in light of the wilting performance of its predecessor.

That night, the men break into John's home and kill the puppy before stealing the car. Iosef takes the Mustang to a chop shop to remove its identifying details, but the shop owner, Aurelio, recognizes the vehicle and refuses service. John learns from Aurelio that Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov, the boss of the city's Russian mafia.\n\nLearning of his son's actions, Viggo beats and berates Iosef for incurring John's wrath. Viggo reveals that John was formerly a hitman in his employ, renowned and feared in the criminal underworld as the \"Baba Yaga,\" a ruthless and relentless \"man of focus, commitment, and sheer will.\" After John fell in love with Helen, a civilian, Viggo gave him a seemingly \"impossible task\" to earn his freedom.\n\nJohn recovers his concealed stash from his former career, including weapons and gold coins used as underworld currency for special services. He refuses Viggo's attempt to make amends for his son's actions and kills the hit squad subsequently sent to his home. As a result, Viggo puts a $2 million bounty on John's head, and his former mentor Marcus is enlisted to take him out. John lodges in the city at the Continental, a luxurious hotel that serves as neutral ground for the underworld and where conducting criminal \"business\" is strictly forbidden. The hotel's owner and John's old friend, Winston, secretly informs John that Iosef is at the Red Circle nightclub. John infiltrates the club and confronts Iosef, but he is attacked by Kirill, Viggo's henchman, and forced to retreat to the Continental for medical attention.\n\nAs John rests, he is targeted by a hitwoman named Ms. Perkins, who sneaks into his room. Marcus sees Perkins from an adjacent building and fires a warning shot to alert John. He wakes up and subdues Perkins, who reveals that Viggo doubled the bounty for her to kill him in the hotel. She also discloses that Viggo has a high-value stash concealed in a church. John has another hitman, Harry, secure Perkins, but she escapes and kills Harry.\n\nAt the church, John destroys Viggo's cache of cash and extensive blackmail material. When Viggo arrives to assess the damage, John assaults him and his men but is captured after being hit by Kirill's car. John tells Viggo that he will not stop until Iosef is dead because the puppy gave him hope and a chance to not be alone in his grief for Helen. Marcus intervenes again to save John, allowing him to kill Kirill and threaten Viggo into revealing his son's location. John assaults the safehouse and kills Iosef. Afterward, Marcus encourages John to return to the everyday life he has built, but their meeting is witnessed by Perkins, who reveals Marcus's duplicity to Viggo. He has Marcus tortured and killed before calling John to taunt him with the details, drawing him back to the city.\n\nPerkins is executed at Winston's behest for breaking the Continental's rules, and Winston informs John that Viggo is preparing to leave the city by helicopter. John races to the New York Harbor, where he fights and mortally wounds Viggo. Resigned to dying from his own injuries, John watches a video on his phone of Helen telling him they need to go home.

In 1953 Francis Crick, James Watson, Rosalind Franklin, and colleagues, working at Medical Research Council unit, Cavendish laboratory, Cambridge (now the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology), made a double helix model of DNA which changed the entire research scenario. They proposed the DNA structure based on previous research done by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. This research then lead to finding DNA material in other microorganisms, plants and animals.\n\nMolecular biology is not simply the study of biological molecules and their interactions; rather, it is also a collection of techniques developed since the field's genesis which have enabled scientists to learn about molecular processes. In this way it has both complemented and improved biochemistry and genetics as methods (of understanding nature) that began before its advent. One notable technique which has revolutionized the field is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which was developed in 1983. PCR is a reaction which amplifies small quantities of DNA, and it is used in many applications across scientific disciplines.\n\nThe central dogma of molecular biology describes the process in which DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into protein.\n\nMolecular biology also plays a critical role in the understanding of structures, functions, and internal controls within individual cells, all of which can be used to efficiently target new drugs, diagnose disease, and better understand cell physiology.

What do you think?\" \n\nThe King thought for a few minutes, and then nodded in agreement. \"What do you have in mind, my Queen?\" And so, soon the stone sculptor was summoned to appear before the Court for an appointment to build in his way the statutes of the gods.

Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. \n\nThe King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked \"Your majesties, what can I do for you?\" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court \"We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom. We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.\"\n\nThe sculptor was silent. As his silence extended, ministers of the court began to feel restless. \"Speak up! How can you be silent when the Queen graces you so!\" But still, the sculptor was silent. \n\nThe King and Queen sat patiently in their thrones as they waited for the sculptor to respond.

I will work in a closed hall, where none may enter - regardless of whether they can hear me working or otherwise. None may enter until I open the doors from within and proclaim to all that the statues are completed.\"\n\nThe ministers gasped - what a strange request from this man. Was he a fool?

She glanced at the King, and it seemed to her that he agreed on this condition without reservation.

The NAB represents more than 8,300 terrestrial radio and television stations as well as broadcast networks.\n\nAs of 2022, the president and CEO of the NAB is Curtis LeGeyt.\n\nFounding\n\nNAB headquarters in Washington, D.C.\nThe NAB was founded as the National Association of Radio Broadcasters (NARB) in April 1923 at the Drake Hotel in Chicago. The association's founder and first president was Eugene F. McDonald Jr., who also launched the Zenith corporation. In 1951 it changed its name to the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters (NARTB) to include the television industry. In 1958 it adopted its current name, \"National Association of Broadcasters\".\n\nCommercial radio\nThe NAB worked to establish a commercial radio system in the United States. The system was set up in August 1928 with the establishment of General Order 40\u2014a radio reallocation scheme by the Federal Radio Commission which awarded the choicest frequencies and broadcast times to the then-emerging commercial radio industry. In the wake of General Order 40, a loose coalition of educators, nonprofit broadcasters, labor unions, and religious groups coalesced to oppose the NAB and their allies through the 1920s and 1930s, and to develop a public, nonprofit, license-funded radio system without commercials (similar to what happened with the BBC). The coalition claimed that the commercial industry would only promote profitable programming, thereby reducing the quality and future potential of radio broadcasting.\n\nNot having the political connections, resources, or publicity of the NAB and the commercial radio industry, the non-profit coalition eventually lost the fight with the passage of the Communications Act of 1934.\n\nThe National Independent Broadcasters were formed in 1939 as part of the NAB, to represent stations that were not associated with any network, but the group split off in 1941.\n\nSatellite radio\nMany satellite radio enthusiasts have criticized the NAB for lobbying against legislation approvals for those services. The NAB protested the FCC's approval of both satellite radio services in the United States\u2014XM and Sirius\u2014and furthermore criticized the 2008 merger of the two companies, calling the merged company a \"potential monopoly\".\n\nDigital transition\nIn 2005, the NAB, together with the Association for Maximum Service Television Stations, Inc. (MSTV), commenced development of a prototype high quality, low cost digital-to-analog converter box for terrestrial digital television reception. The result of this project was a specification for the converter box, which was then adopted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration as a technical requirement for eligible converter boxes for the Administration's Digital-to-Analog Converter Box Coupon Program.\n\nWhite space\nThe NAB has lobbied against the use of white spaces, unused broadcast spectrum lying between broadcast channels, for wireless broadband internet and other digital use. The NAB has claimed that use of white space will interfere with existing broadcast spectrum, even though tests by the Federal Communications Commission at levels far stronger than that being advocated for in policy circles have not supported such claims. Indeed, the FCC has recommended the use of white spaces for broadband and other digital use. In 2011 the NAB funded an advertising campaign titled \"The Future of TV\", advocating for the private ownership of the spectrum, framed as a threat to free television.\n\nFree TV campaign\nIn mid-2014, an NAB advertising campaign against a Congressional threat appeared, advocating viewers to defeat a cable-TV lobby.\n\nSimilar organizations\nOrganizations similar to the NAB exist in individual U.S. states, including Georgia Association of Broadcasters (GAB) in Georgia, and the Illinois Broadcasters Association (IBA), in Illinois.

One could make a case for any of the following. Jerome Kern wrote more than 700 songs and wrote the music to \"Showboat\", one of the first Broadway musicals with a serious plot and themes. The songwriting team of Rogers & Hammerstein was the first to use songs to further the plot vs. break the plot for a song and dance. Their musicals are still enormously popular and performed constantly. They include \"Oklahoma\", \"The King & I\", and \"The Sound of Music\". Leonard Bernstein, while most known for classical music made a major contribution to musicals with the groundbreaking \"West Side Story\", an updated Romeo and Juliet story with spectacular music, every song a classic. Bernstein collaborated with Stephen Sondheim on this musical. Sondheim ushered in the modern-day musical in which shows might explore a theme vs. a linear plot. While he is often criticized for not having \"hummable\" melodies, his genius is undeniable, and he did have one bonafide hit with \"Send in the Clowns\". Jules Styne composed what is often considered the greatest musical of all time, \"Gypsy\". The dynamite songwriting team of John Kander and Fred Ebb composed the longest-running American musical, \"Chicago\" and the dark yet entertaining \"Cabaret\". Finally, while often criticized by musical-theatre purists as blatantly commercial, the success of Andrew Lloyd Webber cannot be denied.

First publicly disclosed by Google on January 12, 2010, in a blog post, the attacks began in mid-2009 and continued through December 2009.\n\nThe attack was aimed at dozens of other organizations, of which Adobe Systems, Akamai Technologies, Juniper Networks, and Rackspace have publicly confirmed that they were targeted. According to media reports, Yahoo, Symantec, Northrop Grumman, Morgan Stanley, and Dow Chemical were also among the targets.\n\nAs a result of the attack, Google stated in its blog that it plans to operate a completely uncensored version of its search engine in China \"within the law, if at all,\" and acknowledged that if this is not possible, it may leave China and close its Chinese offices. Official Chinese sources claimed this was part of a strategy developed by the U.S. government.\n\nThe attack was named \"Operation Aurora\" by Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of Threat Research at cybersecurity company McAfee. Research by McAfee Labs discovered that \"Aurora\" was part of the file path on the attacker's machine that was included in two of the malware binaries McAfee said were associated with the attack. \"We believe the name was the internal name the attacker(s) gave to this operation,\" McAfee Chief Technology Officer George Kurtz said in a blog post.\n\nAccording to McAfee, the primary goal of the attack was to gain access to and potentially modify source code repositories at these high-tech, security, and defense contractor companies. \"[The SCMs] were wide open,\" says Alperovitch. \"No one ever thought about securing them, yet these were the crown jewels of most of these companies in many ways\u2014much more valuable than any financial or personally identifiable data that they may have and spend so much time and effort protecting.\"\n\nHistory\n\nFlowers left outside Google China's headquarters after its announcement it might leave the country\nOn January 12, 2010, Google revealed on its blog that it had been the victim of a cyber attack. The company said the attack occurred in mid-December and originated from China. Google stated that over 20 other companies had been attacked; other sources have since cited that more than 34 organizations were targeted. As a result of the attack, Google said it was reviewing its business in China. On the same day, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a brief statement condemning the attacks and requesting a response from China.\n\nOn January 13, 2010, the news agency All Headline News reported that the United States Congress plans to investigate Google's allegations that the Chinese government used the company's service to spy on human rights activists.\n\nIn Beijing, visitors left flowers outside of Google's office. However, these were later removed, with a Chinese security guard stating that this was an \"illegal flower tribute\". The Chinese government has yet to issue a formal response, although an anonymous official stated that China was seeking more information on Google's intentions.\n\nAttackers involved\nFurther information: Cyberwarfare by China\nTechnical evidence including IP addresses, domain names, malware signatures, and other factors, show Elderwood was behind the Operation Aurora attack. The \"Elderwood\" group was named by Symantec (after a source-code variable used by the attackers), and is referred to as the \"Beijing Group\" by Dell Secureworks. The group obtained some of Google's source code, as well as access to information about Chinese activists. Elderwood also targeted numerous other companies in the shipping, aeronautics, arms, energy, manufacturing, engineering, electronics, financial, and software sectors.\n\nThe \"APT\" designation for the Chinese threat actors responsible for attacking Google is APT17.\n\nElderwood specializes in attacking and infiltrating second-tier defense industry suppliers that make electronic or mechanical components for top defense companies. Those firms then become a cyber \"stepping stone\" to gain access to top-tier defense contractors. One attack procedure used by Elderwood is to infect legitimate websites frequented by employees of the target company \u2013 a so-called \"water hole\" attack, just as lions stake out a watering hole for their prey. Elderwood infects these less-secure sites with malware that downloads to a computer that clicks on the site. After that, the group searches inside the network to which the infected computer is connected, finding and then downloading executives' e-mails and critical documents on company plans, decisions, acquisitions, and product designs.\n\nAttack analysis\nIn its blog posting, Google stated that some of its intellectual property had been stolen. It suggested that the attackers were interested in accessing Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents. According to the Financial Times, two accounts used by Ai Weiwei had been attacked, their contents read and copied; his bank accounts were investigated by state security agents who claimed he was under investigation for \"unspecified suspected crimes\". However, the attackers were only able to view details on two accounts and those details were limited to things such as the subject line and the accounts' creation date.\n\nSecurity experts immediately noted the sophistication of the attack. Two days after the attack became public, McAfee reported that the attackers had exploited purported zero-day vulnerabilities (unfixed and previously unknown to the target system developers) in Internet Explorer and dubbed the attack \"Operation Aurora\". A week after the report by McAfee, Microsoft issued a fix for the issue, and admitted that they had known about the security hole used since September. Additional vulnerabilities were found in Perforce, the source code revision software used by Google to manage their source code.\n\nVeriSign's iDefense Labs claimed that the attacks were perpetrated by \"agents of the Chinese state or proxies thereof\".\n\nAccording to a diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, a Chinese source reported that the Chinese Politburo directed the intrusion into Google's computer systems. The cable suggested that the attack was part of a coordinated campaign executed by \"government operatives, public security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the Chinese government.\" The report suggested that it was part of an ongoing campaign in which attackers have \"broken into American government computers and those of Western allies, the Dalai Lama and American businesses since 2002.\" According to The Guardian's reporting on the leak, the attacks were \"orchestrated by a senior member of the Politburo who typed his own name into the global version of the search engine and found articles criticising him personally.\"\n\nOnce a victim's system was compromised, a backdoor connection that masqueraded as an SSL connection made connections to command and control servers running in Illinois, Texas, and Taiwan, including machines that were running under stolen Rackspace customer accounts. The victim's machine then began exploring the protected corporate intranet that it was a part of, searching for other vulnerable systems as well as sources of intellectual property, specifically the contents of source code repositories.\n\nThe attacks were thought to have definitively ended on Jan 4 when the command and control servers were taken down, although it is not known at this point whether or not the attackers intentionally shut them down. However, the attacks were still occurring as of February 2010.\n\nResponse and aftermath\nThe German, Australian, and French governments publicly issued warnings to users of Internet Explorer after the attack, advising them to use alternative browsers at least until a fix for the security hole was made. The German, Australian, and French governments considered all versions of Internet Explorer vulnerable or potentially vulnerable.\n\nIn an advisory on January 14, 2010, Microsoft said that attackers targeting Google and other U.S. companies used software that exploits a hole in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8 on Windows 7, Vista, Windows XP, Server 2003, Server 2008 R2, as well as IE 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.\n\nThe Internet Explorer exploit code used in the attack has been released into the public domain, and has been incorporated into the Metasploit Framework penetration testing tool. A copy of the exploit was uploaded to Wepawet, a service for detecting and analyzing web-based malware operated by the computer security group at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \"The public release of the exploit code increases the possibility of widespread attacks using the Internet Explorer vulnerability,\" said George Kurtz, CTO of McAfee, of the attack. \"The now public computer code may help cybercriminals craft attacks that use the vulnerability to compromise Windows systems.\"\n\nSecurity company Websense said it identified \"limited public use\" of the unpatched IE vulnerability in drive-by attacks against users who strayed onto malicious Web sites. According to Websense, the attack code it spotted is the same as the exploit that went public last week.[clarification needed] \"Internet Explorer users currently face a real and present danger due to the public disclosure of the vulnerability and release of attack code, increasing the possibility of widespread attacks,\" said George Kurtz, chief technology officer of McAfee, in a blog update. Confirming this speculation, Websense Security Labs identified additional sites using the exploit on January 19. According to reports from Ahnlab, the second URL was spread through the Instant Messenger network Misslee Messenger, a popular IM client in South Korea.\n\nResearchers have created attack code that exploits the vulnerability in Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) and IE8\u2014even when Microsoft's recommended defensive measure (Data Execution Prevention (DEP)) is turned on.[dubious \u2013 discuss] According to Dino Dai Zovi, a security vulnerability researcher, \"even the newest IE8 isn't safe from attack if it's running on Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) or earlier, or on Windows Vista RTM (release to manufacturing), the version Microsoft shipped in January 2007.\"\n\nMicrosoft admitted that the security hole used had been known to them since September. Work on an update was prioritized and on Thursday, January 21, 2010, Microsoft released a security patch aiming to counter this weakness, the published exploits based on it and a number of other privately reported vulnerabilities. They did not state if any of the latter had been used or published by exploiters or whether these had any particular relation to the Aurora operation, but the entire cumulative update was termed critical for most versions of Windows, including Windows 7.\n\nSecurity researchers continued to investigate the attacks. HBGary, a security firm, released a report in which they claimed to have found some significant markers that might help identify the code developer. The firm also said that the code was Chinese language based but could not be specifically tied to any government entity.\n\nOn February 19, 2010, a security expert investigating the cyber-attack on Google, has claimed that the people behind the attack were also responsible for the cyber-attacks made on several Fortune 100 companies in the past one and a half years. They have also tracked the attack back to its point of origin, which seems to be two Chinese schools, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Lanxiang Vocational School. As highlighted by The New York Times, both of these schools have ties with the Chinese search engine Baidu, a rival of Google China. Both Lanxiang Vocational and Jiaotong University have denied the allegation.\n\nIn March 2010, Symantec, which was helping investigate the attack for Google, identified Shaoxing as the source of 21.3% of all (12 billion) malicious emails sent throughout the world.\n\nGoogle retrospective\nOn October 3, 2022, Google on YouTube released a six-episode series covering the events that occurred during Operation Aurora, with commentary from insiders who dealt with the attack, though the series primary focus was to reassure the Google-using public that measures are in place to counter hacking attempts.", "response": "Google, Adobe Systems, Akamai Technologies, Juniper Networks, Rackspace, Yahoo, Symantec, Northrop Grumman, Morgan Stanley, and Dow Chemical appear to have been targted in these attacks.

Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005).\n\nGinsburg was born and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Her older sister died when she was a baby, and her mother died shortly before Ginsburg graduated from high school. She earned her bachelor's degree at Cornell University and married Martin D. Ginsburg, becoming a mother before starting law school at Harvard, where she was one of the few women in her class. Ginsburg transferred to Columbia Law School, where she graduated joint first in her class. During the early 1960s she worked with the Columbia Law School Project on International Procedure, learned Swedish, and co-authored a book with Swedish jurist Anders Bruzelius; her work in Sweden profoundly influenced her thinking on gender equality. She then became a professor at Rutgers Law School and Columbia Law School, teaching civil procedure as one of the few women in her field.\n\nGinsburg spent much of her legal career as an advocate for gender equality and women's rights, winning many arguments before the Supreme Court. She advocated as a volunteer attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union and was a member of its board of directors and one of its general counsel in the 1970s. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where she served until her appointment to the Supreme Court in 1993. Between O'Connor's retirement in 2006 and the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor in 2009, she was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, such as with Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (2007). Ginsburg's dissenting opinion was credited with inspiring the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act which was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009, making it easier for employees to win pay discrimination claims. Ginsburg received attention in American popular culture for her passionate dissents in numerous cases, widely seen as reflecting paradigmatically liberal views of the law. She was dubbed \"The Notorious R.B.G.\", and she later embraced the moniker.\n\nDespite two bouts with cancer and public pleas from liberal law scholars, she decided not to retire in 2013 or 2014 when Obama and a Democratic-controlled Senate could appoint and confirm her successor. Ginsburg died at her home in Washington, D.C., on September 18, 2020, at the age of 87, from complications of metastatic pancreatic cancer. The vacancy created by her death was filled 39 days later by Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative. The result was one of three major rightward shifts in the Court since 1953, following the appointment of Clarence Thomas to replace Thurgood Marshall in 1991 and the appointment of Warren Burger to replace Earl Warren in 1969.", "category": "information_extraction"}, {"instruction": "How do you install a wooden fence?", "context": "", "response": "First, you would start by plotting out the line of the fence around your yard.

The syndrome is no longer recognised as a diagnosis in itself, having been merged with other conditions into autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It was considered to differ from other diagnoses that were merged into ASD by relatively unimpaired spoken language and intelligence.\n\nThe syndrome was named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger, who, in 1944, described children in his care who struggled to form friendships, did not understand others' gestures or feelings, engaged in one-sided conversations about their favourite interests, and were clumsy. In 1994, the diagnosis of Asperger's was included in the fourth edition (DSM-IV) of the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; however, with the publication of DSM-5 in 2013 the syndrome was removed, and the symptoms are now included within autism spectrum disorder along with classic autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). It was similarly merged into autism spectrum disorder in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as of 2021.\n\nThe exact cause of Asperger's is poorly understood. While it has high heritability, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying condition. There is no single treatment, and the UK's National Health Service (NHS) guidelines suggest that 'treatment' of any form of autism should not be a goal, since autism is not 'a disease that can be removed or cured'. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, while co-occurring conditions might require treatment, 'management of autism itself is chiefly about the provision of the education, training and social support/care required to improve the person's ability to function in the everyday world'. The effectiveness of particular interventions for autism is supported by only limited data. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems, such as mood or anxiety. Autistic characteristics tend to become less obvious in adulthood, but social and communication difficulties usually persist.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome", "response": "The syndrome was named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger, who, in 1944, described children in his care who struggled to form friendships, did not understand others' gestures or feelings, engaged in one-sided conversations about their favourite interests, and were clumsy.", "category": "closed_qa"}, {"instruction": "What singer has had a Billboard No. 1 hit in each of the last four decades?", "context": "", "response": "Mariah Carey", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "Name the four members of the Beatles.", "context": "The Beatles\u00a0were an English\u00a0rock\u00a0band, formed in\u00a0Liverpool\u00a0in 1960, that comprised\u00a0John Lennon,\u00a0Paul McCartney,\u00a0George Harrison\u00a0and\u00a0Ringo Starr.

Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942.

Such methods of therapy also seek the increase of functional independence in autistic people. Many therapies marketed towards autistic people and/or their parents claim outcomes that have not been supported by Level of Research (LOE) Level 1 (highest level assigned based on the methodological quality of their design, validity, and applicability to patient care). Level 1 research includes evidence from a systematic review or meta-analysis of all relevant RCTs (randomized controlled trial) or evidence-based clinical practice guidelines based on systematic reviews of RCTs or three or more RCTs of good quality that have similar results.\n\n\nAutism is a neurotype characterized by sensory and communication difference, when compared to neurotypical and allistic individuals.None of these therapies eliminate autism within someone, let alone to a high degree of viability. Autistic children grow up to become autistic adults at risk of burnout and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) inflicted during childhood and adolescence, often overlooked by those who prioritize the elimination of autism over the common well-being of autistic people. Treatment is typically catered to the person's needs. Treatments fall into two major categories: educational interventions and medical management. Training and support are also given to families of those diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)\n\n\nStudies of interventions have some methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy.Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the systematic reviews have reported that the quality of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options.Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children with ASD acquire self-care, social, and job skills,and often can improve functioning, and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors;Available approaches include applied behavior analysis (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, speech and language therapy, social skills therapy, and occupational therapy. Occupational therapists work with autistic children by creating interventions that promote social interaction like sharing and cooperation.They also support the autistic child by helping them work through a dilemma as the OT imitates the child and waiting for a response from the child.Educational interventions have some effectiveness in children: intensive ABA treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children,and is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children.Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided.The limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results.\n\n\nMany medications are used to treat problems associated with ASD.More than half of U.S. children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants, with the most common drug classes being antidepressants, stimulants.Aside from antipsychotics,there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD.A person with ASD may respond atypically to medications, the medications can have adverse effects, and no known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments.\n\n\nAs of 2008 the treatments prescribed to children with ASD were expensive;indirect costs are more so. For someone born in 2000, a U.S. study estimated an average discounted lifetime cost of $4.66 million (2023 dollars, inflation-adjusted from 2003 estimate), with about 10% medical care, 30% extra education and other care, and 60% lost economic productivity.A UK study estimated discounted lifetime costs at \u00a31.9 million and \u00a31.23 million for an autistic person with and without intellectual disability, respectively(2023 pounds, inflation-adjusted from 2005/06 estimate). Legal rights to treatment are complex, vary with location and age, and require advocacy by caregivers. Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child, and unreimbursed out-of-pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems;one 2008 U.S. study found a 14% average loss of annual income in families of children with ASD, and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment.", "response": "There are multiple therapies available for Autism depending on the spectrum.\nIntensive, sustained special education programs and behaviour therapy early in life can help children with ASD acquire self-care, social, and job skills, and often can improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviours; Available approaches include applied behaviour analysis (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, speech and language therapy, social skills therapy, and occupational therapy.

Later that year, Lyft sold the original Zimride service to Enterprise Holdings, the parent company of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, to enable the company to focus exclusively on the growth of Lyft.\n\nLyft's marketing strategy included large pink furry mustaches that drivers attached to the front of their cars and encouraging riders to sit in the front seat and fist bump with drivers upon meeting. In November 2014, the company distanced itself from the fist bump. In January 2015, Lyft introduced a small, glowing plastic dashboard mustache it called a \"glowstache\" as an alternative to the large fuzzy mustaches on the front of cars. The transition was to help overcome the resistance of some riders to arrive at destinations, such as business meetings, in a car with a giant mustache.\n\nIn April 2014, Lyft hired two lobbying firms, TwinLogic Strategies, and Jochum Shore & Trossevin, to address the regulatory barriers and opposition it had received since its launch. Due to regulatory hurdles in New York City, the company altered its business model when establishing Lyft on the East Coast of the United States. Lyft's launch in New York City occurred on the evening of July 25, 2014, and, by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) and the approval of the Manhattan Supreme Court, only drivers registered with the TLC were permitted to drive Lyft-branded vehicles in New York City.\n\nIn August 2014, the company introduced a shared ride concept, which provides cheaper fares.\n\nIn December 2017, Lyft expanded into Canada, with operations in the Toronto, Hamilton and Ottawa metropolitan areas.\n\nIn March 2018, Lyft partnered with Allscripts to create a platform allowing healthcare providers to arrange rides for patients who lack transportation to appointments. The service would be available to 2,500 hospitals, 180,000 physicians, and approximately 7 million patients. Lyft acquired Motivate, a bicycle-sharing system and the operator of Capital Bikeshare and Citi Bike, in November 2018. The company also announced plans to add 28,000 Citi Bikes and expand its service.\n\nIn March 2019, Lyft became a public company via an initial public offering, raising $2.34 billion at a valuation of $24.3 billion. The company set aside some shares to be given to long-time drivers.\n\nIn March 2020, Lyft acquired Halo Cars which pays drivers to display digital advertisements on their vehicles. In April 2020, Lyft laid off 982 employees and furloughed an additional 288 to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The company continued to offer scooters for rent in San Francisco, while Miami government asked Lyft to halt operations.\n\nIn August 2020, Lyft partnered with rental car company Sixt to let users access rental cars. Most of the rental cars are owned and operated by Sixt, with 85 locations in the US. Lyft receives commissions from rentals.\n\nIn December 2020, Lyft announced plans to launch a multi-city U.S. robotaxi service in 2023 with Motional. Lyft sold its self-driving car division to Toyota for $550 million in April 2021. The division had partnerships with General Motors, NuTonomy, Ford Motor Company, GoMentum Station, and Magna International. It also owned Blue Vision Labs, a London-based augmented reality startup, acquired in 2018 for $72 million.\n\nIn April 2022, Lyft announced an agreement to acquire PBSC Urban Solutions, a Canadian bike-share equipment and technology supplier.

Although Malay, Mandarin and Tamil are also official languages, English is the language of instruction for nearly all subjects except the official Mother Tongue languages and the literatures of those languages; these are generally not taught in English, although there is provision for the use of English at the initial stages. Certain schools, such as secondary schools under the Special Assistance Plan (SAP), encourage a richer use of the mother tongue and may occasionally teach subjects in Mandarin Chinese.\n\nSingapore's education system has been consistently ranked as one of the highest in the world by the OECD. It is believed that this comes from the style of teaching that is implemented in Singapore. Teachers focus on making sure that each of their students thoroughly move through the syllabus before moving on. By doing this teachers in Singapore teach a much more narrow but deeper type of instruction. Furthermore, it has been described as \"world-leading\" and in 2010 was among those picked out for commendation by the Conservative former UK Education Secretary Michael Gove. According to PISA, an influential worldwide study on educational systems, Singapore has the highest performance in international education and tops in global rankings.

Jordan is the principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA and of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. He was integral in popularizing the basketball sport and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming a global cultural icon.\n\nJordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game's best defensive players. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames \"Air Jordan\" and \"His Airness\". Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993\u201394 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995\u201396 NBA season.

He is best known for his time in Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and other combat sports. A member of the UFC Hall of Fame, Shamrock is widely regarded as an icon and pioneer of the sport. He has headlined over 15 main events and co-main events in the UFC and Pride FC and set numerous MMA pay-per-view records. In the early part of his UFC career, Shamrock was named \"The World's Most Dangerous Man\" by ABC News in a special called \"The World's Most Dangerous Things\". The moniker has stuck as his nickname.\n\nShamrock became known early on in the UFC for his rivalry with Royce Gracie. After fighting to a draw in the inaugural UFC \"Superfight\", he became the first UFC Superfight Champion when he defeated Dan Severn at UFC 6; the title was eventually replaced by the UFC Heavyweight Championship when weight categories were introduced to the UFC. He was also the first foreign MMA champion in Japan, winning the title of King of Pancrase Openweight title. During his reign as the UFC Superfight Champion, he was widely considered the #1 mixed martial artist in the world, and in 2008, Shamrock was ranked by Inside MMA as one of the top 10 greatest mixed martial arts fighters of all time. He is the founder of the Lion's Den mixed martial arts training camp, and is the older brother of fellow fighter Frank Shamrock.\n\nIn addition to his mixed martial arts career, Shamrock enjoyed considerable success in professional wrestling, particularly during his tenure with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). There, he is a one-time Intercontinental Champion, a one-time World Tag Team Champion and the 1998 King of the Ring. Shamrock also wrestled for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, now Impact Wrestling), where he is a one-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion \u2013 the first world champion under the TNA banner \u2013 and a 2020 inductee in the Impact Hall of Fame. He headlined multiple pay-per-view events in both promotions, including 1997's D-Generation X: In Your House, where he challenged for the WWF Championship. Additionally, Shamrock was also one of the first wrestlers to use the shoot style of wrestling in America, being credited by WWE with popularizing the legitimate ankle lock submission hold.\n\nA \"military brat,\" Kilpatrick was born at Robins Air Force Base, in Warner Robins, Georgia, where he lived for his first four years. His father Richard Kilpatrick was a United States Air Force enlistee, and his mother Diane Kilpatrick was a waitress and dancer who had her first son when she was 15. Shamrock had three brothers and came from a broken family in a predominantly black neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nHe was often left to fend for himself, and, without his parents' supervision or guidance, got into many fights. His father abandoned his family when Shamrock was five. His mother married an Army aviator named Bob Nance, and the newly formed family moved to Napa, California, Nance's hometown. Shamrock and his brothers were outsiders in this community, coming from a poor background and speaking in a Southern accent. They continued to cause trouble and get into fights and began using drugs. Nance, who fought in the Vietnam War, joined the local fire department and also worked in roofing and upholstery. Shamrock became involved in and excelled at sports at a young age, playing in Little League baseball and Pop Warner football. Nance remembers a veteran coach telling him that he had never seen a player with as much heart and tenacity as the young Shamrock. Shamrock was not as involved with drugs as his brothers, such as his brother Richie, who enjoyed smoking marijuana and eventually using heroin intravenously, but who also played football.\n\nAt age 10, Shamrock ran away from home for the first time, and was stabbed by another child on the run, ending up in the hospital. When he was 13, his stepfather kicked him out of their home, and each of the brothers went their own ways. Shamrock lived in cars before being placed in a foster home. He went through seven group homes and served time in a juvenile hall. He moved between several more group homes before being placed in Bob Shamrock's Boys' Home at age 14 in Susanville, California where he turned his life around. Bob Shamrock legally adopted Ken as his son, and Ken changed his last name from Kilpatrick to Shamrock in Bob's honor.\n\nAt Lassen High School, Shamrock (known there as Kenny Nance) excelled in football and wrestling. As a senior, he qualified for the state championships in wrestling, but broke his neck in practice days before the competition and underwent neck surgery. He received no scholarship offers from any big colleges, and doctors told him his sports career was likely over. Against doctors' orders, he joined the Shasta College football team, where he was voted team captain in his final season.

From about the 13th century onwards, cheese production started to develop on French farms. Over time, the recipes for making cheese were handed down from generation to generation (and tweaked and improved by each generation), further increasing the number of varieties. \n\nAs a result, today it is commonly considered that there are between 350 and 400 different types of French cheese \u2013 although there are actually almost 1,000 varieties!

Nuclear fission is a very cool concept that gives us nuclear energy to power our homes and cities! You know how everything around us is made of little components called atoms, right? The centers of these atoms, called the nuclei, are themselves made of particles, called protons and neutrons. These particles are super tiny, hundreds of times smaller than the atoms themselves! Anyway, the particles in the nucleus are stuck firmly together, but if disturbed by a high-energy particle, the nucleus can split apart. When it does that, it releases a lot of energy as light and heat. This splitting of the nucleus is called fission.\n\nIn some materials, each nucleus that splits also releases more loose particles, typically neutrons, that can hit other atoms, and this leads to what's called a chain reaction: one atom splitting can cause others to do so, and keep releasing more energy. If left uncontrolled in a dense enough material, this leads to an atomic explosion, which is very bad. Definitely don't try that at home! In fact don't try anything else at home. But if controlled with the right amount of moderating material, this type of reaction can give rise to a continuous and cheap source of energy, as used in nuclear power plants. Some countries get most of their energy today from nuclear fission.\n\nThe craziest thing about nuclear fission is that it was only discovered and put into use starting in the 1930s.

There are Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV. Type I is based upon a heavy truck chassis-cab with a custom rear compartment that is often referred to as a \"box\" or \"module.\" Type I ambulances are primarily used for Advanced Life Support (ALS), also referred to as Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) in some jurisdictions, and rescue work. A Type II ambulance is based on a commercial heavy-duty van with few modifications except for a raised roof and a secondary air conditioning unit for the rear of the vehicle. These types of ambulances are primarily used for Basic Life Support (BLS) and transfer of patients but it is not uncommon to find them used for advanced life support and rescue. Type III is a van chassis-cab but with a custom-made rear compartment and has the same uses as Type I ambulances. Type IV is for smaller ad hoc patient transfer that use smaller utility vehicles in which passenger vehicles and trucks would have difficulty in traversing, such as large industrial complexes, commercial venues, and special events with large crowds; they generally do not fall under Federal Regulations.\n\nAmbulances can be based on many types of vehicle although emergency and disaster conditions may lead to other vehicles serving as makeshift ambulances:\n\n\nA modern American ambulance built on the chassis of a Ford F-450 truck, with extensive external storage\n\nMany modern Canadian and European ambulances are built on the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter chassis. Some, like this Niagara Region example, use custom rear compartments.\nVan or pickup truck \u2013 A typical general-purpose ambulance is based on either the chassis of a van (vanbulance) or a light-duty truck. This chassis is then modified to the designs and specifications of the purchaser. Vans may either retain their original body and be upfitted inside, or may be based on a chassis without the original body with a modular box body fitted instead. Those based on pickup trucks almost always have modular bodies. Those vehicles intended for especially intensive care or require a large amount of equipment to be carried may be based on medium-duty trucks.\nCar \u2013 Used either as a fly-car for rapid response or to transport patients who can sit, these are standard car models adapted to the requirements of the service using them. Some cars are capable of taking a stretcher with a recumbent patient, but this often requires the removal of the front passenger seat, or the use of a particularly long car. This was often the case with early ambulances, which were converted (or even serving) hearses, as these were some of the few vehicles able to accept a human body in a supine position. Some operators use modular-body transport ambulances based on the chassis of a minivan and station wagon.\nMotorcycle and motor scooter \u2013 In urban areas, these may be used for rapid response in an emergency as they can travel through heavy traffic much faster than a car or van. Trailers or sidecars can make these patient transporting units. See also motorcycle ambulance.\n\nPatient being loaded into a medical helicopter\nBicycle \u2013 Used for response, but usually in pedestrian-only areas where large vehicles find access difficult. Like the motorcycle ambulance, a bicycle may be connected to a trailer for patient transport, most often in the developing world. See also cycle responder.\nAll-terrain vehicle (ATV) \u2013 for example quad bikes; these are used for response off-road, especially at events. ATVs can be modified to carry a stretcher, and are used for tasks such as mountain rescue in inaccessible areas.\n\nGolf Cart converted into an ambulance\nGolf cart or Neighborhood Electric Vehicle \u2013 Used for rapid response at events or on campuses. These function similarly to ATVs, with less rough terrain capability, but with less noise.\nHelicopter \u2013 Usually used for emergency care, either in places inaccessible by road, or in areas where speed is of the essence, as they are able to travel significantly faster than a road ambulance. Helicopter and fixed-wing ambulances are discussed in greater detail at air ambulance.\nFixed-wing aircraft \u2013 These can be used for either acute emergency care in remote areas (such as in Australia, with the 'Flying Doctors'), for patient transport over long distances (e.g. a re-patriation following an illness or injury in a foreign country), or transportation between distant hospitals. Helicopter and fixed-wing ambulances are discussed in greater detail at air ambulance.\nBoat \u2013 Boats can be used to serve as ambulances, especially in island areas or in areas with a large number of canals, such as the Venetian water ambulances. Some lifeboats or lifeguard vessels may fit the description of an ambulance as they are used to transport a casualty.\nBus \u2013 In some cases, buses can be used for multiple casualty transport, either for the purposes of taking patients on journeys, in the context of major incidents, or to deal with specific problems such as drunken patients in town centres. Ambulance buses are discussed at greater length in their own article.\nTrailer \u2013 In some instances a trailer, which can be towed behind a self-propelled vehicle can be used. This permits flexibility in areas with minimal access to vehicles, such as on small islands.\nHorse and cart \u2013 Especially in developing world areas, more traditional methods of transport include transport such as horse and cart, used in much the same way as motorcycle or bicycle stretcher units to transport to a local clinic.\nFire engine \u2013 Fire services (especially in North America) often train firefighters to respond to medical emergencies and most apparatuses carry at least basic medical supplies.

The median longitudinal fissure separates the human brain into two distinct cerebral hemispheres, connected by the corpus callosum. Although the macrostructure of the two hemispheres appears to be almost identical, different composition of neuronal networks allows for specialized function that is different in each hemisphere.\n\nLateralization of brain structures is based on general trends expressed in healthy patients; however, there are numerous counterexamples to each generalization. Each human's brain develops differently, leading to unique lateralization in individuals. This is different from specialization, as lateralization refers only to the function of one structure divided between two hemispheres. Specialization is much easier to observe as a trend, since it has a stronger anthropological history.\n\nThe best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. Function lateralization, such as semantics, intonation, accentuation, and prosody, has since been called into question and largely been found to have a neuronal basis in both hemispheres. Another example is that each hemisphere in the brain tends to represent one side of the body. In the cerebellum, this is the same body side, but in the forebrain this is predominantly the contralateral side.\n\nLanguage functions such as grammar, vocabulary and literal meaning are typically lateralized to the left hemisphere, especially in right-handed individuals. While language production is left-lateralized in up to 90% of right-handers, it is more bilateral, or even right-lateralized, in approximately 50% of left-handers.\n\nBroca's area and Wernicke's area, associated with the production of speech and comprehension of speech, respectively, are located in the left cerebral hemisphere for about 95% of right-handers but about 70% of left-handers. 69\u200a Individuals who speak multiple languages demonstrate separate speech areas for each language.\n\nThe processing of basic sensory information is lateralized by being divided into left and right sides of the body or the space around the body.\n\nIn vision, about half the neurons of the optic nerve from each eye cross to project to the opposite hemisphere, and about half do not cross to project to the hemisphere on the same side. This means that the left side of the visual field is processed largely by the visual cortex of the right hemisphere and vice versa for the right side of the visual field.\n\nIn hearing, about 90% of the neurons of the auditory nerve from one ear cross to project to the auditory cortex of the opposite hemisphere.\n\nIn the sense of touch, most of the neurons from the skin cross to project to the somatosensory cortex of the opposite hemisphere.\n\nBecause of this functional division of the left and right sides of the body and of the space that surrounds it, the processing of information in the sensory cortices is essentially identical. That is, the processing of visual and auditory stimuli, spatial manipulation, facial perception, and artistic ability are represented bilaterally. Numerical estimation, comparison and online calculation depend on bilateral parietal regions while exact calculation and fact retrieval are associated with left parietal regions, perhaps due to their ties to linguistic processing.\n\nRather than just being a series of places where different brain modules occur, there are running similarities in the kind of function seen in each side, for instance how right-side impairment of drawing ability making patients draw the parts of the subject matter with wholly incoherent relationships, or where the kind of left-side damage seen in language impairment not damaging the patient's ability to catch the significance of intonation in speech. This has led British psychiatrist Iain McGilchrist to view the two hemispheres as having different value systems, where the left hemisphere tends to reduce complex matters such as ethics to rules and measures, and the right hemisphere is disposed to the holistic and metaphorical.\n\nDepression is linked with a hyperactive right hemisphere. The delusional misidentification syndromes, reduplicative paramnesia and Capgras delusion are also often the result of right hemisphere lesions.\n\nDamage to either the right or left hemisphere, and its resulting deficits provide insight into the function of the damaged area. Left hemisphere damage has many effects on language production and perception. Damage or lesions to the right hemisphere can result in a lack of emotional prosody or intonation when speaking. Right hemisphere damage also has grave effects on understanding discourse. People with damage to the right hemisphere have a reduced ability to generate inferences, comprehend and produce main concepts, and a reduced ability to manage alternative meanings. Furthermore, people with right hemisphere damage often exhibit discourse that is abrupt and perfunctory or verbose and excessive. They can also have pragmatic deficits in situations of turn taking, topic maintenance and shared knowledge.\n\nLateral brain damage can also affect visual perceptual spatial resolution. People with left hemisphere damage may have impaired perception of high resolution, or detailed, aspects of an image. People with right hemisphere damage may have impaired perception of low resolution, or big picture, aspects of an image.\n\nIf a specific region of the brain, or even an entire hemisphere, is injured or destroyed, its functions can sometimes be assumed by a neighboring region in the same hemisphere or the corresponding region in the other hemisphere, depending upon the area damaged and the patient's age. When injury interferes with pathways from one area to another, alternative (indirect) connections may develop to communicate information with detached areas, despite the inefficiencies.\n\nBroca's aphasia is a specific type of expressive aphasia and is so named due to the aphasia that results from damage or lesions to the Broca's area of the brain, that exists most commonly in the left inferior frontal hemisphere. Thus, the aphasia that develops from the lack of functioning of the Broca's area is an expressive and non-fluent aphasia. It is called 'non-fluent' due to the issues that arise because Broca's area is critical for language pronunciation and production. The area controls some motor aspects of speech production and articulation of thoughts to words and as such lesions to the area result in specific non-fluent aphasia.\n\nWernicke's aphasia is the result of damage to the area of the brain that is commonly in the left hemisphere above the Sylvian fissure. Damage to this area causes primarily a deficit in language comprehension. While the ability to speak fluently with normal melodic intonation is spared, the language produced by a person with Wernicke's aphasia is riddled with semantic errors and may sound nonsensical to the listener. Wernicke's aphasia is characterized by phonemic paraphasias, neologism or jargon. Another characteristic of a person with Wernicke's aphasia is that they are unconcerned by the mistakes that they are making.\n\nTerence Hines states that the research on brain lateralization is valid as a research program, though commercial promoters have applied it to promote subjects and products far outside the implications of the research. For example, the implications of the research have no bearing on psychological interventions such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and neurolinguistic programming, brain-training equipment, or management training.\n\nSome popularizations oversimplify the science about lateralization, by presenting the functional differences between hemispheres as being more absolute than is actually the case. Interestingly, research has shown quite opposite function of brain lateralisation, i.e. left hemisphere creatively and chaotically links between concepts and right hemisphere tends to adhere to specific date and time, although generally adhering to the pattern of left-brain as linguistic interpretation and right brain as spatio-temporal.\n\nIn the 19th century and to a lesser extent the 20th, it was thought that each side of the brain was associated with a specific gender: the left corresponding with masculinity and the right with femininity and each half could function independently. The right side of the brain was seen as the inferior and thought to be prominent in women, savages, children, criminals, and the insane.

The second-stage boot loader does not need drivers for its own operation, but may instead use generic storage access methods provided by system firmware such as the BIOS or Open Firmware, though typically with restricted hardware functionality and lower performance.\n\nMany boot loaders can be configured to give the user multiple booting choices. These choices can include different operating systems (for dual or multi-booting from different partitions or drives), different versions of the same operating system (in case a new version has unexpected problems), different operating system loading options (e.g., booting into a rescue or safe mode), and some standalone programs that can function without an operating system, such as memory testers (e.g., memtest86+), a basic shell (as in GNU GRUB), or even games (see List of PC Booter games).Some boot loaders can also load other boot loaders; for example, GRUB loads BOOTMGR instead of loading Windows directly. Usually, a default choice is preselected with a time delay during which a user can press a key to change the choice; after this delay, the default choice is automatically run so normal booting can occur without interaction.\n\nThe boot process can be considered complete when the computer is ready to interact with the user, or the operating system is capable of running system programs or application programs.\n\nMany embedded systems must boot immediately. For example, waiting a minute for a digital television or a GPS navigation device to start is generally unacceptable. Therefore, such devices have software systems in ROM or flash memory so the device can begin functioning immediately; little or no loading is necessary, because the loading can be precomputed and stored on the ROM when the device is made.\n\nLarge and complex systems may have boot procedures that proceed in multiple phases until finally the operating system and other programs are loaded and ready to execute.

Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C.

In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827.

In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\".

Generative AI systems use generative models such as large language models to statistically sample new data based on the training data set that was used to create them.\n\nNotable generative AI systems include ChatGPT, a chatbot built by OpenAI using the GPT-3 and GPT-4 large language models and Bard, a chatbot built by Google using the LaMDA model. Other generative AI models include artificial intelligence art systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E.\n\nGenerative AI has potential applications across a wide range of industries, including software development, marketing, and fashion. Investment in generative AI surged during the early 2020s, with large companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Baidu as well as numerous smaller firms developing generative AI models.\n\nModalities\nA detailed oil painting of figures in a futuristic opera scene\nTh\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Op\u00e9ra Spatial, an image generated by Midjourney\nA generative AI system is constructed by applying unsupervised or self-supervised machine learning to a data set. The capabilities of a generative AI system depend on the modality or type of the data set used.\n\nText: Generative AI systems trained on words or word tokens include GPT-3, LaMDA, LLaMA, BLOOM, GPT-4, and others (see List of large language models). They are capable of natural language processing, machine translation, and natural language generation and can be used as foundation models for other tasks. Data sets include BookCorpus, Wikipedia, and others (see List of text corpora).\nCode: In addition to natural language text, large language models can be trained on programming language text, allowing them to generate source code for new computer programs. Examples include OpenAI Codex.\nImages: Generative AI systems trained on sets of images with text captions include such as Imagen, DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and others (see Artificial intelligence art, Generative art, Synthetic media). They are commonly used for text-to-image generation and neural style transfer. Datasets include LAION-5B and others (See Datasets in computer vision).\nMolecules: Generative AI systems can be trained on sequences of amino acids or molecular representations such as SMILES representing DNA or proteins. These systems, such as AlphaFold, are used for protein structure prediction and drug discovery. Datasets include various biological datasets.\nMusic: Generative AI systems such as MusicLM can be trained on the audio waveforms of recorded music along with text annotations, in order to generate new musical samples based on text descriptions such as \"a calming violin melody backed by a distorted guitar riff\".\nVideo: Generative AI trained on annotated video can generate temporally-coherent video clips. Examples include Gen1 by RunwayML and Make-A-Video by Meta Platforms.\nMultimodal: A generative AI system can be built from multiple generative models, or one model trained on multiple types of data.

Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.\n\nAI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).\n\nAs machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require \"intelligence\" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.\n\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since it has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"), followed by new approaches, success, and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge, and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical and statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.\n\nThe various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability, and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.\n\nThe field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence \"can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\". This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity. Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals.

Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\u200a\nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.", "response": "While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering.

LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.\n\nProperties\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nHallucinations\nMain article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)\nIn artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a \"hallucination\" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nOn a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.\nUnpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called \"emergent abilities\". Researchers note that such abilities \"cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models\". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word\u2019s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\n\nArchitecture and training\nLarge language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or \"filling in the blanks\", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.\n\nThe earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words. The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.\n\nLLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.\n\nA 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training. These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).\n\nApplication to downstream tasks\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via \"prompting\" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.\n\nFine-tuning\nMain article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nFine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be \"frozen\", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).\n\nPrompting\nSee also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)\nIn the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In \"few-shot prompting\", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:\n\nReview: This movie stinks.\nSentiment: negative\n\nReview: This movie is fantastic!\nSentiment:\n\nIf the model outputs \"positive\", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be \"The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is\".\n\nFew-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.\n\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt \"Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet.\" might provide a completion such as \"A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17.\" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, \"self-instruct\", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "response": "In artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a \"hallucination\" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.", "category": "closed_qa"}, {"instruction": "What are 3 popular dishes that can feed a large group of people?", "context": "", "response": "Pizza is a popular dish that can be easily distributed.

The stated aim was to improve administration. However, this was seen as an attempt to quench nationalistic sentiment through divide and rule. The Bengali Hindu intelligentsia exerted considerable influence on local and national politics. The partition outraged Bengalis. Widespread agitation ensued in the streets and in the press, and the Congress advocated boycotting British products under the banner of swadeshi, or indigenous industries. A growing movement emerged, focussing on indigenous Indian industries, finance, and education, which saw the founding of National Council of Education, the birth of Indian financial institutions and banks, as well as an interest in Indian culture and achievements in science and literature. Hindus showed unity by tying Rakhi on each other's wrists and observing Arandhan (not cooking any food). During this time, Bengali Hindu nationalists like Sri Aurobindo, Bhupendranath Datta, and Bipin Chandra Pal began writing virulent newspaper articles challenging the legitimacy of British rule in India in publications such as Jugantar and Sandhya, and were charged with sedition.\n\nThe Partition also precipitated increasing activity from the then still Nascent militant nationalist revolutionary movement, which was particularly gaining strength in Bengal and Maharashtra from the last decade of the 1800s. In Bengal, Anushilan Samiti, led by brothers Aurobindo and Barin Ghosh organised a number of attacks of figureheads of the Raj, culminating in the attempt on the life of a British judge in Muzaffarpur. This precipitated the Alipore bomb case, whilst a number of revolutionaries were killed, or captured and put on trial.

Also, advances to ski equipment and slope grooming technology make skiing a lot safer than it used to be years ago.\n\nLearning to ski as an adult may take longer than learning as a child. It is recommended that you start with some lessons first to gain the right technique. This could be group lessons or private lessons. You could also learn from friends who know how to ski, or learn by watching online tutorials and applying them yourself on the mountain. Once you have the basic skills, you should be able to ski easy slopes and start enjoying skiing as a fun activity. \n\nIn addition to lessons, you will also need the right gear to ski. This includes appropriate clothing that can keep you warm on the mountain while you ski, as well as ski equipment that you will use. It is recommended that you get a pair of skis and poles, good fitting boots, a helmet for safety, and goggles to protect your eyes from the elements. Renting your equipment is a good option when you're starting. That way you are not making an expensive commitment upfront. You could also buy your equipment either new or from any of the second-hand ski shops and ski swaps.\n \nWith the right gear and knowledge of the basics, you can take your learning in any direction you want. Many people choose to stay at a beginner or intermediate level and just enjoy the occasional ski trip with friends. While others take their passion forward with more practice, hours on the mountain, and likely more lessons to get to advanced levels.\n\nWhichever path you pick, skiing can be a fun sport to learn and enjoy for the rest of your life.

Along with Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan, Singapore is one of the Four Asian Tigers, and has surpassed its peers in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. Between 1965 and 1995, growth rates averaged around 6 per cent per annum, transforming the living standards of the population.\n\nThe Singaporean economy is regarded as free, innovative, dynamic and business-friendly. For several years, Singapore has been one of the few countries with an AAA credit rating from the big three, and the only Asian country to achieve this rating. Singapore attracts a large amount of foreign investment as a result of its location, skilled workforce, low tax rates, advanced infrastructure and zero-tolerance against corruption. It is the world's most competitive economy in 2019, according to the World Economic Forum's ranking of 141 countries, with the 2nd highest GDP per capita. Roughly 44 percent of the Singaporean workforce is made up of non-Singaporeans. Despite market freedom, Singapore's government operations have a significant stake in the economy, contributing 22% of the GDP. The city is a popular location for conferences and events.\n\nThe currency of Singapore is the Singapore dollar (SGD or S$), issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). It has been interchangeable with the Brunei dollar at par value since 1967. MAS manages its monetary policy by allowing the Singapore dollar exchange rate to rise or fall within an undisclosed trading band. This is different from most central banks, which use interest rates to manage policy. Singapore has the world's eleventh largest foreign reserves, and one of the highest net international investment position per capita.\n\nSingapore has been identified as a tax haven for the wealthy due to its low tax rates on personal income and tax exemptions on foreign-based income and capital gains. Individuals such as Australian millionaire retailer Brett Blundy and multi-billionaire Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin are two examples of wealthy individuals who have settled in Singapore. In 2009, Singapore was removed from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \"liste grise\" of tax havens, and ranked fourth on the Tax Justice Network's 2015 Financial Secrecy Index of the world's off-shore financial service providers, banking one-eighth of the world's offshore capital, while \"providing numerous tax avoidance and evasion opportunities\". In August 2016, The Straits Times reported that Indonesia had decided to create tax havens on two islands near Singapore to bring Indonesian capital back into the tax base. In October 2016, the Monetary Authority of Singapore admonished and fined UBS and DBS and withdrew Falcon Private Bank's banking licence for their alleged role in the Malaysian Sovereign Fund scandal.\n\n\nPanoramic view of the Central Business District\nSingapore has the world's highest percentage of millionaires, with one out of every six households having at least one million US dollars in disposable wealth. This excludes property, businesses, and luxury goods, which if included would increase the number of millionaires, especially as property in Singapore is among the world's most expensive. In 2016, Singapore was rated the world's most expensive city for the third consecutive year by the Economist Intelligence Unit, and this remained true in 2018. The government provides numerous assistance programmes to the homeless and needy through the Ministry of Social and Family Development, so acute poverty is rare. Some of the programmes include providing between S$400 and S$1000 of financial assistance per month to needy households, providing free medical care at government hospitals, and paying for children's tuition. Other benefits include compensation for gym fees to encourage citizens to exercise, up to S$166,000 as a baby bonus for each citizen, heavily subsidised healthcare, financial aid for the disabled, the provision of reduced-cost laptops for poor students, rebates for costs such as public transport and utility bills, and more.

The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth observers being in a rotating reference frame; this apparent motion caused many cultures to have mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model, which prevailed until astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus formulated his heliocentric model in the 16th century.\nAstronomically, sunrise occurs for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon. However, the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point:\nTwilight, the period in the morning during which the sky is brightening, but the Sun is not yet visible. The beginning of morning twilight is called astronomical dawn.\nThe period after the Sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen.\nThe timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and is also affected by the viewer's latitude and longitude, altitude, and time zone. These changes are driven by the axial tilt of Earth, daily rotation of the Earth, the planet's movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the Sun, and the Earth and Moon's paired revolutions around each other. The analemma can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise.\nIn late winter and spring, sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day, reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice; although the exact date varies by latitude. After this point, the time of sunrise gets later each day, reaching its latest sometime around the winter solstice. The offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis, and is described by the analemma, which can be used to predict the dates.\nVariations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position. Near the poles, the time-of-day variation is exaggerated, since the Sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly.\nAccounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of day relative to night.

Is a good life innate or learned, and can anyone achieve it?", "context": "", "response": "One of the most tantalizing and theorized about topics is that of the meaning of life and how to live a \u201cgood\u201d one. It is human nature to explain the unknown and create explanations for the way the world works; throughout history philosophers have come to their own conclusions on why some lives are good and others are not. Two key figures that lend insight in these respects are Socrates in Plato\u2019s The Apology, and Aristotle in Nicomachean Ethics. A seemingly simple concept quickly devolves into a confusing and complex web of components that only together in the right proportions lend each man or woman a full good life. In order to discuss the way in which we are to lead a good life we must first discuss the differing factors that contribute to the definition of good in the eyes of Socrates and Aristotle. What are the components of the concept of good? Is it innate or learned? Can it be purchased? Is it temporary or is it eternal? Does it apply to one\u2019s self or a community as a whole? Does one conduct oneself to be good? How Is a good life given by the gods or earned by humans? And although there is no definitive answer to any of these questions, in both author\u2019s texts living a good life comes down to the choices you make and how they compare to the definition of good you subscribe to. Socrates and Aristotle use words such as virtue, courage, happiness, and intelligence to describe their versions of the path you take to reach a good life, and all are important, but the main driver of a good life is one\u2019s ability to find the proper equilibrium between\nDahlke 1\n each of their characteristics that lend towards the development of a commonly defined good life.\nTheorizing on how to live a good life leads to the necessity of defining what a good life is and the components that make it up. Aristotle theorized in Nicomachean Ethics that the idea of virtue, or excellence, can be an overarching theme for the components that make up the highest \u201cgood\u201d, the good that is an endpoint or product encompassing the entire life before it. And the development of virtue lies within a midpoint between too much and too little of any emotion, action or characteristic.\n... it is in emotions and actions that excess, deficiency and the median are found. Thus we can experience fear confidence, desire, anger, pity and generally any kind of pleasure and pain either too much or too little, and in either case not properly. But to experience all this at the right time, towards the right objects, towards the right people, for the right reason, and in the right manner \u2014 that is the median and the best course, the course that is a mark of virtue. (Aristotle. Bk. 2, pg. 43)\nAnd still, even with the most precise definition Aristotle or Socrates gives there is a great amount of ambiguity. While some characteristics or actions are classified as inherently good or bad Aristotle theorizes that simply over exercising the usage of one or two characteristics doesn\u2019t mean you are a good person living a good life. But rather, he states that there is a median usage point between the extrema of never and always that contributes to virtue, and then a good life. Where that point is is still unknown, partly due to the infinite situational differences one person can have versus another person\nDahlke 2\n\n during their lifetime and partly due to the complexity and magnitude of the variables that contribute to the person as a whole. However, Aristotle goes into a few overarching descriptors of his definition of a virtuous man or woman to help define the median between the two extrema. For example, the median for pleasure and pain is self control, between fear and confidence is courage, and righteous falls between envy and spite.1 These examples shine a light on how to find the middle between two opposing qualities, but do not instruct on how we are to lead a good life. While definitively defining the idea of good is complex the framework of thought to use when faced with daily decisions Aristotle provides allows for the discussion on how to live a good life.\nCreating a structured plan for how to live a good life brings about the question can anyone live a good life? Furthermore, are the segments that complete virtue innate or are they learned? Aristotle delves into two schools of thought, the first being that there are some characteristics that born with can impede or halt one\u2019s quest for moral virtue, and secondly, that one develops these traits over time and through ritual habit. The latter, he describes in analogy, \u201cSimilarly, we become just by the practice of just actions, self-controlled by exercising self-control, and courageous by performing acts of courage.\u201d (Aristotle. Bk. 2, pg. 34) In other words, one becomes virtuous by continually being virtuous. Therefore, one finds oneself in a good life when one habitually lives within the middle of all opposing qualities. While not everyone in a society will live a good life, everyone within a society can live a good life. At this point it is important to\n1 Examples given in Book II Ch. 7 - Nicomachean Ethics\nDahlke 3\n \n refer back to the definition of what a good life is, it does not mean success, fame or wealth, but rather practicing the combination of elements that create virtue.\nWhile some qualities like virtue are relatively undisputed as good, wealth is a heavily debated part of a good life. Both Aristotle and Socrates agree that wealth is not an indicator of a good life but their thought differs when it comes to the part money plays in the development of such a life. While Aristotle believes wealth is a necessity for aspects of a virtuous life, Socrates believes that wealth is only a byproduct of a good life. Aristotle does concede to saying that, \u201cwealth is not the good which we are trying to find, for it is only useful, i.e., it is a means to something else.\u201d (Aristotle. Bk. 1, pg. 9) Otherwise saying that while wealth is not the end goal and is meaningless when thinking of one\u2019s worth, it is helpful in the creation of a good life. On the other hand, Socrates writes of wealth as something that does not create excellence and at times can even inhibit it\u2019s development. In The Apology Socrates says to the jury, \u201cWealth does not bring about excellence, but excellence brings about wealth and all other public and private blessings for men.\u201d (Plato. 30b) While this quote is taken out of the context of a defensive argument, it still holds Socrates\u2019 beliefs on wealth. He, an impoverished man, does not find the same value in money as sophists like Aristotle, and while defending his choice to not charge a fee to the pupils that followed his philosophical thought like other sophists did, he said that he is here at the service to god. Both theories on wealth\u2019s role in a good life are important to consider. Does wealth lead to corruption and poverty to a more sinful life? Wealth, similarly to fear, needs a median. As Aristotle describes fear, too little is being reckless, while too much is being cowardly. In wealth the same thought\nDahlke 4\n\n can be applied, too little creates extreme poverty which distracts from living a virtuous life and too much can create different distractions that lead to the same result.\nAnother contesting theory is that of the length in which \u201cgoodness\u201d lasts. When defining a good life, it is important to think about when you can use good as a descriptor. If goodness in reference to one\u2019s life lasts forever then the term is permanent and can be applied throughout one's life. If on the contrary, goodness comes and goes throughout life the term can only be used temporarily or in posterity noting one\u2019s life as a whole. Socrates, after the announcement of his execution states, \u201ca good man cannot be harmed either in life or death, and that his affairs are not neglected by the gods.\u201d (Plato. 41 c-d) Lending the idea that a good man or woman living a good life is continuous and permanent, throughout life and death. However, Aristotle argues that since a good life is a sum of smaller goods, to use the term to describe someone's life, it must come at the end of their life, looking at it as a whole. After describing smaller goals and endpoints he goes further and says, \u201cThe highest good, on the other hand, must be something final\u201d (Aristotle. Bk. 1 pg. 14) Stating that while there are different branches of a good life, virtuous behavior is not a constant and therefore you cannot give a description to their life as a whole until it\u2019s end. Socrates\u2019 arguments on the length of goodness are rather naive, seeing as people change over time, only with the entire information of their lives can one make a claim as to whether or not they had a good life.\nIn summary, the two different views on how we are to live a good life together provide insight and theory into the subject but neither provides a complete instruction on doing so. Socrates, as written down by Plato, describes his own life which he\nDahlke 5\n\nconsiders to be a virtuous one and Aristotle provides a philosophical theory behind how to live in a virtuous way with the end goal of happiness or in other words a good life. The closest we can get to understanding how to live a good life is by understanding what makes up a good life, and even this is subjective. One person\u2019s views on what a virtuous life means can differ greatly from the next depending on where they lived, their religious beliefs, or social status. These variances result in many different guides to and definitions of a good life. Within all the different viewpoints, a concept introduced in Nicomachean Ethics that can be widely accepted is that within someone\u2019s life there is a median point between each of their emotions, actions and characteristics that create virtue and lead towards a good life.", "category": "creative_writing"}, {"instruction": "When do schools close for summer vacation in Cameroon and Nigeria?", "context": "Schools and universities typically have a summer break to take advantage of the warmer weather and longer days.

It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act, after a series of financial panics (particularly the panic of 1907) led to the desire for central control of the monetary system in order to alleviate financial crises.[list 1] Over the years, events such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Great Recession during the 2000s have led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nCongress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act: maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long-term interest rates. The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. Its duties have expanded over the years, and currently also include supervising and regulating banks, maintaining the stability of the financial system, and providing financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions. The Fed also conducts research into the economy and provides numerous publications, such as the Beige Book and the FRED database.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System is composed of several layers. It is governed by the presidentially-appointed board of governors or Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, located in cities throughout the nation, regulate and oversee privately-owned commercial banks. Nationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in, and can elect some board members of, the Federal Reserve Bank of their region.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets monetary policy. It consists of all seven members of the board of governors and the twelve regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents, though only five bank presidents vote at a time\u2014the president of the New York Fed and four others who rotate through one-year voting terms. There are also various advisory councils.[list 2] It has a structure unique among central banks, and is also unusual in that the United States Department of the Treasury, an entity outside of the central bank, prints the currency used.\n\nThe federal government sets the salaries of the board's seven governors, and it receives all the system's annual profits, after dividends on member banks' capital investments are paid, and an account surplus is maintained. In 2015, the Federal Reserve earned a net income of $100.2 billion and transferred $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury, and 2020 earnings were approximately $88.6 billion with remittances to the U.S. Treasury of $86.9 billion. Although an instrument of the U.S. government, the Federal Reserve System considers itself \"an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the president or by anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by Congress, and the terms of the members of the board of governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms.\"", "response": "The main objectives of the Federal Reserve are to maximize employment, stabilize prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.", "category": "summarization"}, {"instruction": "Give me a list of popular news podcast to listen to", "context": "", "response": "The Daily, Up First, Pod Save America, Global News Podcast, Morning Wire", "category": "brainstorming"}, {"instruction": "Identify which animal species is alive or extinct: Spinosaurus, Common Bottlenose Dolphin", "context": "", "response": "Common Bottlenose Dolphin is alive, Spinosaurus is extinct.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Why are airlines tickets so expensive, right now?", "context": "", "response": "Post pandemic, airline travel has gotten more expensive due to all the major airlines having to cancel a lot of daily flights on popular routes.

It is also a popular dessert in Japan. The characteristic rings that appear in its slices resemble tree rings, and give the cake its German name, Baumkuchen, which literally translates to \"tree cake\" or \"log cake\".\n\nHistory\nIt is disputed who made the first Baumkuchen and where it was first baked. One theory is that it was invented in the German town of Salzwedel, which is further popularized by the town itself. Another theory suggests it began as a Hungarian wedding cake.[citation needed] In Ein new Kochbuch (lit. \"A New Cookbook\"), the first cookbook written for professional chefs by Marx Rumpolt, there is a recipe for Baumkuchen. This publication puts the origin of Baumkuchen as far back at 1581, the year the cookbook was first published. Marx Rumpolt had previously worked as a chef in Hungary and Bohemia.[citation needed]\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBaumkuchen baked on a spit\nTraditionally, Baumkuchen is made on a spit by brushing on even layers of batter and then rotating the spit around a heat source. Each layer is allowed to brown before a new layer of batter is poured. When the cake is removed and sliced, each layer is divided from the next by a golden line, resembling the growth rings on a crosscut tree. A typical Baumkuchen is made up of 15 to 20 layers of batter. However, the layering process for making Baumkuchen can continue until the cakes are quite large. Skilled pastry chefs have been known to create cakes with 25 layers and weighing over 100 pounds (45 kg).

The recipe can be varied by adding other ingredients, such as ground nuts, honey, marzipan, nougat and rum or brandy, to the batter or filling.

It was announced as the successor to the PlayStation 4 in April 2019, was launched on November 12, 2020, in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, and South Korea, and was released worldwide one week later. The PS5 is part of the ninth generation of video game consoles, along with Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S consoles, which were released in the same month.\n\nThe base model includes an optical disc drive compatible with Ultra HD Blu-ray discs. The Digital Edition lacks this drive, as a lower-cost model for buying games only through download. The two variants were launched simultaneously.\n\nThe PlayStation 5's main hardware features include a solid-state drive customized for high-speed data streaming to enable significant improvements in storage performance, an AMD GPU capable of 4K resolution display at up to 120 frames per second, hardware-accelerated ray tracing for realistic lighting and reflections, and the Tempest Engine for hardware-accelerated 3D audio effects. Other features include the DualSense controller with haptic feedback, backward compatibility with the majority of PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR games, and the PlayStation VR2 headset.\n\nHistory\nDevelopment\n\nMark Cerny, the PlayStation 5's chief architect\nThe lead architect of the PlayStation console line, Mark Cerny, implemented a two-year feedback cycle after the launch of the PlayStation 4. This entailed regularly visiting Sony's first-party developers at two-year intervals to find out what concerns they had with shortcomings in Sony's current hardware and how such hardware could be improved in console refreshes or for the next generation. This feedback was fed into the priorities for the console development team. In the development of the PlayStation 5, a key issue was the length of loading times for games. Cerny said several developers, including Epic Games' Tim Sweeney, told him that standard I/O speed of hard disk drives was now a limiting factor in pushing game development. Slow data rates placed limits on the size of data being loaded into the game, the physical location of data on the storage medium, and the duplication of data across the medium in order to reduce load times. An important goal was to find ways to reduce loading time, particularly in games that stream or dynamically load new game areas as the player moves through the game world.\n\nJim Ryan, the CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, stated that Sony had researched the feasibility of a \"low priced, reduced spec\" version of the PlayStation 5, like what Microsoft had done with its Xbox Series X and its lower-power counterpart the Xbox Series S; and concluded that they believed such consoles do not fare well, becoming obsolete too fast.\n\nMarketing and release\nCerny first publicly described the new console in an interview with Wired magazine in April 2019. In early 2019, Sony's financial report for the quarter ending March 31, 2019, affirmed that new next-generation hardware was in development but would ship no earlier than April 2020. In a second Wired magazine interview in October 2019, Sony said it intended to ship its next-generation console worldwide by the end of 2020. The current hardware specifications were revealed in October 2019. At CES 2020, Sony unveiled the official logo for the platform, which follows the similar minimalist styling of the previous PlayStation consoles and brand. Full specifications were given in an online presentation by Cerny and published by Sony and Digital Foundry on March 18, 2020. Digital Foundry spoke with Cerny in detail and published a \"deep dive\" on April 2.\n\nA major game library showcase had been planned for June 4, 2020, but was postponed until June 11 due to the George Floyd protests. This presentation was also the premiere of the console's external hardware design.\n\n\nEvent lighting being set up at SIE headquarters on the evening of November 8, four days before the launch on November 12, 2020.\nSony planned to launch the PlayStation 5 by the 2020 end-of-year holiday period. The date and pricing was confirmed as part of a game showcase presentation on September 16, 2020; the release date in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, and South Korea was confirmed for November 12, 2020, and for most of the rest of the world on November 19, 2020.\n\nPlayStation 5's release in India was delayed, leading to speculation that a trademark dispute was the reason; the name \"PS5\" was briefly trademarked by a different person; eventually the dispute was resolved and the system released there on February 2, 2021. The console launched in Indonesia on January 22, 2021. The system launched in China on May 15, 2021.\n\nThe console launched with two models: a base version with an Ultra HD Blu-ray compatible optical disc drive for retail game support alongside online distribution via the PlayStation Store, and a lower-cost variant lacking the disc drive and retaining digital download support.\n\nFollowing the September 16, 2020, presentation, Sony stated that pre-orders for the console were to open at various retailers on the following day. However, several retailers in the United States and the United Kingdom launched pre-orders that evening, causing a rush on pre-orders, including scalping as many stores' inventories were quickly sold out, and creating confusion. Sony apologized for the incident on September 19, 2020, and promised to increase more pre-order deliveries over the coming days and stock through the end of the year.\n\nWorldwide supply of the console has remained low due to a global chip shortage since 2020. Sony expects a short retail stock until 2023. In August 2022, Sony announced a price increase by up to 20% in most of its markets except the US, citing global economic, inflationary, and supply chain pressures.", "response": "The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

The gods want to limit their creations in case they attempt to usurp the gods. The film deals with humanity's relationship with the gods\u2014their creators\u2014and the consequence of defying them. A human expedition intends to find them and receive knowledge about belief, immortality and death. They find superior beings who appear god-like in comparison to humanity, and the Prometheus crew suffer consequences for their pursuit. Shaw is directly responsible for the events of the plot because she wants her religious beliefs affirmed, and believes she is entitled to answers from her god; her questions remain unanswered and she is punished for her hubris. The film offers similar resolution, providing items of information but leaving the connections and conclusions to the audience, potentially leaving the question unanswered. Further religious allusions are implied by the Engineers' decision to punish humanity with destruction 2,000 years before the events of the film. Scott suggested that an Engineer was sent to Earth to stop humanity's increasing aggression, but was crucified, implying it was Jesus Christ. However, Scott felt that an explicit connection in the film would be \"a little too on the nose.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence, a unifying theme throughout Scott's career as a director, is particularly evident in Prometheus, primarily through the android David. David is like humans but does not want to be like them, eschewing a common theme in \"robotic storytelling\" such as in Blade Runner. David is created in the image of humanity, and while the human crew of the Prometheus ship searches for their creators expecting answers, David exists among his human creators yet is unimpressed; he questions his creators about why they are seeking their own. Lindelof described the ship as a prison for David. At the conclusion of the film, David's creator (Weyland) is dead and his fundamental programming will end without someone to serve. Lindelof explained that David's programming becomes unclear and that he could be programmed by Shaw or his own sense of curiosity. Following Weyland's death, David is left with Shaw, and is sincere and interested in following her, partly out of survival and partly out of curiosity.\n\nAnother theme is creation and the question of \"Who Am I? Who Made Me? Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?\" Development of the in-universe mythology explored the Judeo-Christian creation of humanity, but Scott was interested in Greco-Roman and Aztec creation myths about gods who create humans in their own image by sacrificing a piece of themselves. This creation is shown in the film's opening in which an Engineer sacrifices itself after consuming the dark liquid, acting as a \"gardener in space\" to bring life to a world. One of their expeditions creates humanity, who create artificial life (David) in their own image. David then introduces the dark liquid to Holloway who impregnates a sterile Shaw, and the resulting child impregnates an Engineer, creating the child of all three generations. Scott likened the Engineers to the dark angels of John Milton's Paradise Lost, and said that humanity was their offspring and not God's.\n\nShaw is the only religious believer in the crew and openly displays her religious belief with a necklace of a Christian cross. Lindelof said that with her scientific knowledge, her beliefs felt outdated in 2093. Shaw is excited when she learns that she was created by the Engineers and not a supernatural deity, but rather than cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for meaning is the point of being alive, and so the audience is left to question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for definitive answers. In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that Prometheus is pro-science and explores whether scientific knowledge and faith in God can co-exist.\n\nBeside drawing several influences from Paradise Lost, The Atlantic's Govindini Murty noted further influences, and wrote that \"he striking images Ridley Scott devises for Prometheus reference everything from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 to Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man and Mario Bava's Planet of the Vampires. Scott also expands on the original Alien universe by creating a distinctly English mythology informed by Milton's Paradise Lost and the symbolic drawings of William Blake.\" In September 2021, a further analysis of the film was reported.", "response": "In the movie prometheus, Engineers are  are advanced civilisation from another planet, who created life on earth.

Explore the island for  wood and rock sources; along with large palm leave you  can fashion rope from.  While exploring your  new home, look for caves and / or places  where you could construct a tree fort so you can improve your protected living space.\n\nWeek 2, once your new living  quarters are secured and you have sustainable methods to care for your basic needs, climb to the highest point of the island and look for nearby islands / land and any indication of human habitation.  While searching for these indicators, assess methods of island escape to get through any surf  and start tracking wind and weather patterns daily so you can get a feel for the seasonal rotations.\n\nWeek 3 +, dedicate 3-4 hours a day to building signal fires and SOS stone messages that overheard planes may be able to detect.

Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.\u200a If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.", "response": "Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current.", "category": "information_extraction"}, {"instruction": "How to be a good software engineer?", "context": "", "response": "A diversity of industry experience is required to be a good software engineer.

An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.\nAn electric field generally varies in space and its strength at any one point is defined as the force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own electric field disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, having both magnitude and direction, so it follows that an electric field is a vector field.\nThe study of electric fields created by stationary charges is called electrostatics. The field may be visualised by a set of imaginary lines whose direction at any point is the same as that of the field. This concept was introduced by Faraday, whose term 'lines of force' still sometimes sees use. The field lines are the paths that a point positive charge would seek to make as it was forced to move within the field; they are however an imaginary concept with no physical existence, and the field permeates all the intervening space between the lines. Field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key properties: first, that they originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges; second, that they must enter any good conductor at right angles, and third, that they may never cross nor close in on themselves.", "response": "The study of electric fields created by stationary charges is called electrostatics.", "category": "information_extraction"}, {"instruction": "Why Bengalis are famous for", "context": "", "response": "1.

Leo Tolstoy, Henrik Ibsen, \u00c9mile Zola, and Mark Twain were rejected in favour of authors little read today.\n\nThe first prize in 1901, awarded to the French poet Sully Prudhomme, was heavily criticised. Many believed that the acclaimed Russian author Tolstoy should have been awarded the first Nobel prize in literature.\n\nThe choice of philosopher Rudolf Eucken as Nobel laureate in 1908 is widely considered to be one of the worst mistakes in the history of the Nobel Prize in Literature. The main candidates for the prize that year were poet Algernon Swinburne and author Selma Lagerl\u00f6f, but the Academy were divided between the candidates and, as a compromise, Eucken, representative of the Academy's interpretation of Nobel's \"ideal direction\", was launched as an alternative candidate that could be agreed upon.\n\nThe choice of Swedish writer Selma Lagerl\u00f6f as Nobel laureate in 1909 (for the \"lofty idealism, vivid imagination and spiritual perception that characterizes her writings\") followed fierce debate because of her writing style and subject matter, which broke literary decorums of the time.\n\nDuring World War I and its immediate aftermath, the committee adopted a policy of neutrality, favouring writers from non-combatant countries. The pacifistic author Romain Rolland was awarded the prize for 1915. Other years during the war Scandinavian writers were favoured, or the award was postponed.\n\nIn 1931 the prize was awarded posthumously to the poet and former permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy Erik Axel Karlfeldt, who had died earlier that year. The prize was controversial not just because it was the first and only time the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded posthumously, but because the Academy had previously awarded two other Swedish writers of the same literary era, Selma Lagerl\u00f6f in 1909 and Verner von Heidenstam in 1916. Internationally it was heavily criticised as few had heard of Karlfeldt.\n\nThe Nobel Prize awarded to Pearl Buck in 1938 is one of the most criticised in the history of the prize. The Academy awarded Buck \"for her rich and truly epic descriptions of peasant life in China and for her biographical masterpieces\", referring to acclaimed and popular books published only a few years earlier. But her later work is generally not considered to be of the literary standard of a Nobel laureate.\n\nJohn Steinbeck received the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature. The selection was heavily criticised, and described as \"one of the Academy's biggest mistakes\" in one Swedish newspaper. The New York Times asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose \"limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising\", adding, \"we think it interesting that the laurel was not awarded to a writer ... whose significance, influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age\".\n\nIn 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, but he wrote declining it, stating that \"It is not the same thing if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre or if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre, Nobel Prize laureate. A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honorable form.\" Nevertheless he was awarded the prize.\n\nSoviet dissident writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the 1970 prize laureate, did not attend the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm for fear that the USSR would prevent his return afterwards (his works there were circulated in samizdat\u2014clandestine form). After the Swedish government refused to honour Solzhenitsyn with a public award ceremony and lecture at its Moscow embassy, Solzhenitsyn refused the award altogether, commenting that the conditions set by the Swedes (who preferred a private ceremony) were \"an insult to the Nobel Prize itself.\" Solzhenitsyn did not accept the award and prize money until 10 December 1974, after he was deported from the Soviet Union. Within the Swedish Academy, member Artur Lundkvist had argued that the Nobel Prize in Literature should not become a political prize and questioned the artistic value of Solzhenitsyn's work.\n\nIn 1974, Graham Greene, Vladimir Nabokov, and Saul Bellow were believed to be likely candidates for the prize but the Academy decided on a joint award for Swedish authors Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson, both members of the Swedish Academy at the time, and unknown outside their home country.

According to the Financial Times, \"The region registers close to 40 per cent of the world\u2019s murders despite being home to only 9 per cent of the global population. According to Lapop, one in four Latin Americans was assaulted and robbed\" in 2018. Latin America is caught in a vicious circle, where economic growth is thwarted by high crime rates, and insufficient economic opportunity contributes to high crime. Crime and violence thrives as the rule of law is weak, economic opportunity is scarce, and education is poor. Therefore, effectively addressing crime requires a holistic, multi-sectoral approach that addresses its root social, political, and economic causes.\n\nRecent statistics indicate that crime is becoming the biggest problem in Latin America. Amnesty International has declared Latin America as the most dangerous region in the world for journalists to work.\n\nIn Mexico, armed gangs of rival drug smugglers have been fighting it out with one another, thus creating new hazards in rural areas. Crime is extremely high in all of the major cities in Brazil. Wealthy citizens have had to provide for their own security. In large parts of Rio de Janeiro, armed criminal gangs are said to be in control. Crime statistics were high in El Salvador, Guatemala and Venezuela during 1996. The police have not been able to handle the work load and the military have been called in to assist in these countries. There was a very distinct crime wave happening in Latin America. The city that currently topped the list of the world's most violent cities is San Pedro Sula in Honduras, leading various media sources to label it the \"murder capital of the world.\" Colombia registered a homicide rate of 24.4 per 100,000 in 2016, the lowest since 1974. The 40-year low in murders came the same year that the Colombian government signed a peace agreement with the FARC.\n\nCrime is slowing economic growth and undermining democratic consolidation in Latin America. Today, Latin America has the dubious distinction of being most violent region in the world, with combined crime rates more than triple the world average and are comparable to rates in nations experiencing war. This is taking a tremendous toll on development in the region by both affecting economic growth and public faith in democracy.\n\nThe Inter-American Development Bank estimates that Latin America's per capita Gross Domestic Product would be twenty-five percent higher if the region's crime rates were equal to the world average. Similarly, the World Bank has identified a strong correlation between crime and income inequality. Business associations in the region rank crime as the number one issue negatively affecting trade and investment. Crime-related violence also represents the most important threat to public health, striking more victims than HIV/AIDS or other infectious diseases.", "response": "Countries in Latin America are suffering from a high density of crime.

Bernoulli's principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in static pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy.\u200a The principle is named after the Swiss mathematician and physicist Daniel Bernoulli, who published it in his book Hydrodynamica in 1738.Although Bernoulli deduced that pressure decreases when the flow speed increases, it was Leonhard Euler in 1752 who derived Bernoulli's equation in its usual form. The principle is only applicable for isentropic flows: when the effects of irreversible processes (like turbulence) and non-adiabatic processes (e.g. thermal radiation) are small and can be neglected.\nBernoulli's principle can be derived from the principle of conservation of energy. This states that, in a steady flow, the sum of all forms of energy in a fluid is the same at all points that are free of viscous forces. This requires that the sum of kinetic energy, potential energy and internal energy remains constant. Thus an increase in the speed of the fluid\u2014implying an increase in its kinetic energy (dynamic pressure)\u2014occurs with a simultaneous decrease in (the sum of) its potential energy (including the static pressure) and internal energy. If the fluid is flowing out of a reservoir, the sum of all forms of energy is the same because in a reservoir the energy per unit volume (the sum of pressure and gravitational potential \u03c1\u2009g\u2009h) is the same everywhere.\nBernoulli's principle can also be derived directly from Isaac Newton's second Law of Motion. If a small volume of fluid is flowing horizontally from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure, then there is more pressure behind than in front. This gives a net force on the volume, accelerating it along the streamline.\nFluid particles are subject only to pressure and their own weight. If a fluid is flowing horizontally and along a section of a streamline, where the speed increases it can only be because the fluid on that section has moved from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure; and if its speed decreases, it can only be because it has moved from a region of lower pressure to a region of higher pressure. Consequently, within a fluid flowing horizontally, the highest speed occurs where the pressure is lowest, and the lowest speed occurs where the pressure is highest.", "response": "Bernoulli's principle can be derived directly from Isaac Newton's second Law of Motion.

In 1999, the American Film Institute named her the seventh-greatest female screen legend of Classic Hollywood cinema.\n\nBorn in London to socially prominent American parents, Taylor moved with her family to Los Angeles in 1939. She made her acting debut with a minor role in the Universal Pictures film There's One Born Every Minute (1942), but the studio ended her contract after a year. She was then signed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and became a popular teen star after appearing in National Velvet (1944). She transitioned to mature roles in the 1950s, when she starred in the comedy Father of the Bride (1950) and received critical acclaim for her performance in the drama A Place in the Sun (1951). She starred in \"Ivanhoe\" with Robert Taylor and Joan Fontaine. (1952). Despite being one of MGM's most bankable stars, Taylor wished to end her career in the early 1950s.

She began receiving more enjoyable roles in the mid-1950s, beginning with the epic drama Giant (1956), and starred in several critically and commercially successful films in the following years. These included two film adaptations of plays by Tennessee Williams: Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), and Suddenly, Last Summer (1959); Taylor won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for the latter.

Acid Etching: This is the most DIY friendly option & involves the use of an acid that is allowed to rest for some time over the concrete surface and then cleaned after a few minutes.

Primary factors include head size, length, weight, stiffness, and swingweight  \n\nHead size - Power is closely correlated to head size - the larger the head size, the more power can be generated, all other factors being equal.  A larger head size also provides larger hitting area and 'sweetspot'.  Smaller head sizes tend to equate to more control and maneuverability. \n\nLength - The standard length is a 27 inches, but can range from 26.5 inches to 29 inches.  A longer racquets provides more reach and often results in more power.  Similar to head size, longer racquets may limit maneuverability and control. \n\nWeight - The heavier the racquet, the more power you will generate (increasing the 'swingweight') of the racquet.  The lighter the racquet, the more maneuverable and easier it will be for players to get the racket to the right swing position.  The balance of the racquet is also critical as part of weight.  A more head light racket (more weight in the handle) provides increased maneuverability, especially when using a heavier racquet. A more balanced or head heavy racket are often reserved for lighter racquets to maintain the mass behind the ball\n\nStiffness - Generally speaking, the stiffer the racket, the less energy is lost as the ball is redirected with your racquet and thus, creating more power.  More flexible racquets allow for more feel and control.  Flexible racquets provide more comfort as less shock and impact is transferred to the arm and elbow.\n\nSwingweight - Swingweight measures how heavy a racquet feels when you swing it and the amount of power you can transfer to the ball.

In his home country, he is regarded as \"the greatest and most successful\" Swiss sportsperson in history.\n\nA Wimbledon junior champion in 1998 and former ball boy, Federer won his first major singles title at Wimbledon in 2003 at age 21. Between 2003 and 2009, Federer played in 21 out of 28 major singles finals. He won three of the four majors and the ATP Finals in 2004, 2006, and 2007 as well as five consecutive titles at both Wimbledon and the US Open. He completed the career Grand Slam at the 2009 French Open after three consecutive runner-up finishes to Nadal, his main rival until 2010. At age 27, he surpassed Pete Sampras' record of 14 major men's singles titles at Wimbledon in 2009.\n\nFederer and Stan Wawrinka led the Switzerland Davis Cup team to their first title in 2014, following their Olympic doubles gold victory at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Federer also won a silver medal in singles at the 2012 London Olympics, finishing runner-up to Andy Murray. After a half-year hiatus in late 2016 to recover from knee surgery, Federer returned to tennis, winning three more majors over the next two years, including the 2017 Australian Open over Rafael Nadal and an eighth singles title at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships. At the 2018 Australian Open, Federer became the first man to win 20 major singles titles and shortly the oldest ATP world No. 1 at age 36. In September 2022, he retired from professional tennis following the Laver Cup.\n\nA versatile all-court player, Federer's perceived effortlessness has made him highly popular among tennis fans. Originally lacking self-control as a junior, he transformed his on-court demeanor to become well-liked for his graciousness, winning the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award 13 times. He has won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year award a record five times. Outside of competing, he played an instrumental role in the creation of the Laver Cup team competition. He is also an active philanthropist. He established the Roger Federer Foundation, which targets impoverished children in southern Africa, and has raised funds in part through the Match for Africa exhibition series. He is routinely one of the top ten highest-paid athletes in any sport and ranked first among all athletes with $100 million in endorsement income in 2020.", "category": "closed_qa"}, {"instruction": "Give me the list of top 10 movies of all time, by IMDB rating.

She confides in Poirot that she will soon be murdered, and that nothing can be done to stop it; after refusing Poirot's assistance, Jennie departs in distress, and Poirot is unable to find out anymore information from the staff about Jennie or her address. After returning to the guest house where he is staying, Poirot describes the events to Edward Catchpool, an officer at Scotland Yard - Catchpool reveals that he has spent the day investigating three murders at the luxurious Bloxham Hotel; two women and a man, all in separate rooms, were found dead earlier in the evening, each with a monogrammed cufflink (with the letters 'PJI') in their mouths.\n\nThe following day, Poirot and Catchpool attend the scene of the crime where they discover more details about the victims with the hotel's owner, Luca Lazzari; the victims (Harriet Sippel, Ida Gransbury and Richard Negus) had all arrived at the hotel separately on the same day; each victim was found in their locked hotel rooms; the murders occurred between 19:15 and 20:10 (all three victims were seen alive at 19:15 by hotel staff); Mr. Negus had booked the rooms for all three victims and paid for them ahead of time; a junior clerk saw Mr. Negus in the reception area 15 minutes after room service was provided for the victims. Later on, it's revealed that all three victims had lived in a village called Great Holling, and that Mr. Negus had been engaged to Ida - in addition, Richard had left Great Holling in 1913 after the deaths of the village vicar and his wife, Patrick and Frances Ives. Poirot sends Catchpool to Great Holling to discover more information about the victims. After arriving in the village, Catchpool meets Margaret Ernst, widow of the most recent vicar for the village. After some reluctance, Margaret relays to Catchpool the events of 1913. The vicar's maid had told Harriet Sippel a rumour that the vicar was taking money from villagers to help them 'communicate' with deceased loved ones. Harriet spread the rumour around the village, with the support of Ida and Mr. Negus. The rumours spiralled until there were calls to remove Ives as Vicar, and Frances' health declined as a result. Eventually, unable to bear the rumours any longer, Frances took her own life, with the heartbroken vicar following shortly afterwards. After some questioning, Catchpool learns that the maid who told the original lie was Jennie Hobbs - the same Jennie that Poirot has been searching for all this time.\n\nMeanwhile, as Catchpool is leaving London, Poirot arranges to meet with Nancy Ducane, a famous artist who was seen to be leaving the hotel shortly after the murders - Nancy was also mentioned in Margaret's story as the villager seen to be visiting the church at night with Ives. During the visit, Nancy recognises the names of various Great Holling residents but refuses to provide anymore details. However, Poirot and Constable Stanley Beer find a pair of keys that correspond to two of the victims' hotel rooms. Whilst visiting the home of Nancy's friend to confirm her alibi, Poirot notes several details from different paintings within the house. Shortly after returning home, Poirot learns from Scotland Yard that a fourth murder has occurred at the Bloxham - with Catchpool, the two gentlemen return to the hotel - they find a pool of blood, a monogrammed cufflink and (to Poirot's dismay) Jennie's hat within the room. After returning to their guest house, Poirot and Catchpool are visited by Nancy, who confesses her connection to the events in Great Holling; she was having an affair with Ives, and Jennie - who was also in love with the vicar - had spread the rumours out of jealousy. Nancy's attempts to placate the villagers by telling the truth were dismissed, and indeed further ruined the reputation of the vicar. The following day, Poirot takes Catchpool to visit the address of Samuel Kidd, the witness who saw Nancy at the hotel. However, instead of Samuel, they are greeted by Jennie Hobbs who - Poirot reveals - was formerly engaged to Samuel before she met the vicar. After listening to her testimony, Poirot and Catchpool return to Great Holling in response to a serious attack on Margaret - after speaking with the village doctor, Ambrose Flowerday, Poirot decides to return to the Bloxham one last time to resolve the case.\n\nAt the hotel, Poirot gathers the hotel staff and suspects together to reveal the solution; Nancy Ducane and Jennie Hobbs (with Kidd's assistance) had conspired to kill the three victims. Nancy & Kidd had impersonated Harriet & Mr. Negus at 19.15, and Kidd was the gentleman seen by the clerk at the front desk at 19.30. Nancy confesses to the crimes, but is fatally stabbed by Jennie. At Scotland Yard, Jennie, confesses her side of the story; In 1913, the rumour that Jennie had created was actually intended to save Ives from the scandal of his affair with Nancy. Harriet was convinced that the vicar could help her speak to her dead husband, and upon being refused, viciously spread the rumour in Great Holling. Years later, Mr. Negus contacted Jennie out of remorse for his actions, and the two people hatched a plan to kill all four guilty parties involved in the rumour. Mr. Negus and Jennie would lure Harriet and Ida to the Bloxham under false pretenses and poison them separately; Mr. Negus would then poison Jennie, and finally himself. However, Jennie secretly revealed the plan to Nancy to avoid her own death, and convinced Richard to die before her so that she could find justice against Nancy. Mr. Negus agreed to this plan, and Jennie arranged the scene to look like Mr. Negus had killed himself. Jennie had killed Nancy after she revealed at the meeting that her relationship with Ives had been a physical one, rather than the chaste romance that Jennie had been led to believe.\n\nFour days after Jennie and Kidd's arrest, Poirot and Catchpool receive a letter from Dr Flowerday and Margaret Ernst; they have harboured feelings for each other for years, and after Poirot's intervention have decided to marry.", "response": "1.

All versions around the world are printed by Grafica Veneta in Italy. A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming-of-age fiction, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references.

Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness.\n\nSince the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are widely considered cornerstones of modern literature. As of February 2023, the books have sold more than 600 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been available in 85 languages.

The vast majority of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war.\n\nWorld War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history; it resulted in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\n\nThe causes of World War II are debated, but contributing factors included the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Spanish Civil War, Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet\u2013Japanese border conflicts, the rise of fascism in Europe, and European tensions in the aftermath of World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their \"spheres of influence\" across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, in a military alliance with Italy, Japan and other countries called the Axis. Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the United Kingdom, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history.\n\nJapan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with the Republic of China by 1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor which resulted in the United States and United Kingdom declaring war against Japan. The European Axis powers declared war on the United States in solidarity. Japan soon captured much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943\u2014including a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific\u2014cost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and pushed Germany and its allies back. During 1944 and 1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key western Pacific islands.\n\nThe war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories and the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the Fall of Berlin to Soviet troops, Hitler's suicide, and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the Potsdam Declaration (issued 26 July 1945), the United States dropped the first atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima on 6 August and Nagasaki on 9 August. Faced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet Union's declared entry into the war against Japan on the eve of invading Manchuria, Japan announced on 10 August its intention to surrender, signing a surrender document on 2 September 1945.\n\nWorld War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe and set the foundation for the international order of the world's nations during the Cold War and into present day. The United Nations was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts, with the victorious great powers\u2014China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014becoming the permanent members of its Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion.

In 1633, he joined the VOC and sailed to Batavia, now Jakarta, Indonesia. He participated in several voyages, including one to Japan. In 1642, Tasman was appointed by the VOC to lead an expedition to explore the uncharted regions of the Southern Pacific Ocean. His mission was to discover new trade routes and to establish trade relations with the native inhabitants. After leaving Batavia, Tasman sailed eastward and reached the coast of Tasmania, which he named Van Diemen's Land after his patron. He then sailed north and discovered the west coast of New Zealand, which he named Staten Landt, but later renamed Nieuw Zeeland after the Dutch province of Zeeland.\n\nDespite his achievements, Tasman's expedition was not entirely successful. The encounter with the M\u0101ori people on the South Island of New Zealand resulted in a violent confrontation, which left four of Tasman's men dead. He returned to Batavia without having made any significant contact with the native inhabitants or establishing any trade relations. Nonetheless, Tasman's expedition paved the way for further exploration and colonization of Australia and New Zealand by the Europeans. Tasman continued to serve the Dutch East India Company until his death in 1659, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest explorers of his time.\n\nOrigins and early life\n\nPortrait of Abel Tasman, his wife and daughter. Attributed to Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp, 1637 (not authenticated).\nAbel Tasman was born around 1603 in Lutjegast, a small village in the province of Groningen, in the north of the Netherlands. The oldest available source mentioning him is dated 27 December 1631 when, as a seafarer living in Amsterdam, the 28-year-old became engaged to marry 21-year-old Jannetje Tjaers, of Palmstraat in the Jordaan district of the city.\n\nRelocation to the Dutch East Indies\nEmployed by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), Tasman sailed from Texel (Netherlands) to Batavia, now Jakarta, in 1633 taking the southern Brouwer Route. While based in Batavia, Tasman took part in a voyage to Seram Island (in what is now the Maluku Province in Indonesia) because the locals had sold spices to other European nationalities than the Dutch. He had a narrow escape from death when in an incautious landing several of his companions were killed by the inhabitants of the island.\n\nBy August 1637, Tasman was back in Amsterdam, and the following year he signed on for another ten years and took his wife with him to Batavia. On 25 March 1638 he tried to sell his property in the Jordaan, but the purchase was cancelled.\n\nHe was second-in-command of a 1639 expedition of exploration into the north Pacific under Matthijs Quast. The fleet included the ships Engel and Gracht and reached Fort Zeelandia (Dutch Formosa) and Deshima (an artificial island off Nagasaki, Japan).\n\nFirst major voyage\nIn August 1642, the Council of the Indies, consisting of Antonie van Diemen, Cornelis van der Lijn, Joan Maetsuycker, Justus Schouten, Salomon Sweers, Cornelis Witsen, and Pieter Boreel in Batavia dispatched Tasman and Franchoijs Jacobszoon Visscher on a voyage of exploration to little-charted areas east of the Cape of Good Hope, west of Staten Land (near the Cape Horn of South America) and south of the Solomon Islands.\n\nOne of the objectives was to obtain knowledge of \"all the totally unknown\" Provinces of Beach. This was a purported yet non-existent landmass said to have plentiful gold, which had appeared on European maps since the 15th century, as a result of an error in some editions of Marco Polo's works.\n\nThe expedition was to use two small ships, Heemskerck and Zeehaen.\n\nMauritius\nIn accordance with Visscher's directions, Tasman sailed from Batavia on 14 August 1642 and arrived at Mauritius on 5 September 1642, according to the captain's journal. The reason for this was the crew could be fed well on the island; there was plenty of fresh water and timber to repair the ships. Tasman got the assistance of the governor Adriaan van der Stel.\n\nBecause of the prevailing winds, Mauritius was chosen as a turning point. After a four-week stay on the island, both ships left on 8 October using the Roaring Forties to sail east as fast as possible. (No one had gone as far as Pieter Nuyts in 1626/27.) On 7 November, snow and hail influenced the ship's council to alter course to a more north-easterly direction, with the intention of having the Solomon Islands as their destination.\n\nTasmania\n\nCoastal cliffs of Tasman Peninsula\nOn 24 November 1642, Tasman reached and sighted the west coast of Tasmania, north of Macquarie Harbour. He named his discovery Van Diemen's Land, after Antonio van Diemen, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies.\n\nProceeding south, Tasman skirted the southern end of Tasmania and turned north-east. He then tried to work his two ships into Adventure Bay on the east coast of South Bruny Island, but he was blown out to sea by a storm. This area he named Storm Bay. Two days later, on 1 December, Tasman anchored to the north of Cape Frederick Hendrick just north of the Forestier Peninsula. On 2 December, two ship's boats under the command of the Pilot, Major Visscher, rowed through the Marion Narrows into Blackman Bay, and then west to the outflow of Boomer Creek where they gathered some edible \"greens\". Tasman named the bay, Frederick Hendrik Bay, which included the present North Bay, Marion Bay and what is now Blackman Bay. (Tasman's original naming, Frederick Henrick Bay, was mistakenly transferred to its present location by Marion Dufresne in 1772). The next day, an attempt was made to land in North Bay. However, because the sea was too rough, a ship's carpenter swam through the surf and planted the Dutch flag. Tasman then claimed formal possession of the land on 3 December 1642.\n\nFor two more days, he continued to follow the east coast northward to see how far it went. When the land veered to the north-west at Eddystone Point, he tried to follow the coast line but his ships were suddenly hit by the Roaring Forties howling through Bass Strait. Tasman was on a mission to find the Southern Continent not more islands, so he abruptly turned away to the east and continued his continent-hunting.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nMurderers' Bay, drawing by Isaack Gilsemans\n\nM\u0101ori haka\nTasman had intended to proceed in a northerly direction but as the wind was unfavourable he steered east. The expedition endured a rough voyage and in one of his diary entries Tasman claimed that his compass was the only thing that had kept him alive.\n\nOn 13 December 1642 they sighted land on the north-west coast of the South Island of New Zealand, becoming the first Europeans to sight New Zealand. Tasman named it Staten Landt \"in honour of the States General\" (Dutch parliament). He wrote, \"it is possible that this land joins to the Staten Landt but it is uncertain\", referring to Isla de los Estados, a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of South America, encountered by the Dutch navigator Jacob Le Maire in 1616. However, in 1643 Brouwer's expedition to Valdivia found out that Staaten Landt was separated by sea from the hypothetical Southern Land. Tasman continued: \"We believe that this is the mainland coast of the unknown Southland.\" Tasman thought he had found the western side of the long-imagined Terra Australis that stretched across the Pacific to near the southern tip of South America.\n\nAfter sailing north then east for five days, the expedition anchored about 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) from the coast off what is now Golden Bay. A group of M\u0101ori paddled out in a waka (canoe) and attacked some sailors who were rowing between the two Dutch vessels. Four sailors were clubbed to death with patu.\nIn the evening about one hour after sunset we saw many lights on land and four vessels near the shore, two of which betook themselves towards us. When our two boats returned to the ships reporting that they had found not less than thirteen fathoms of water, and with the sinking of the sun (which sank behind the high land) they had been still about half a mile from the shore. After our people had been on board about one glass, people in the two canoes began to call out to us in gruff, hollow voices. We could not in the least understand any of it; however, when they called out again several times we called back to them as a token answer. But they did not come nearer than a stone's shot. They also blew many times on an instrument, which produced a sound like the moors' trumpets. We had one of our sailors (who could play somewhat on the trumpet) play some tunes to them in answer.\"\n\nAs Tasman sailed out of the bay he observed 22 waka near the shore, of which \"eleven swarming with people came off towards us.\" The waka approached the Zeehaen which fired and hit a man in the largest waka holding a small white flag. Canister shot also hit the side of a waka. It has been speculated that the local Maori had thought the Dutch were trying to land at a major agricultural area, which the M\u0101ori were trying to protect. Tasman named the area \"Murderers' Bay\".\n\nThe expedition then sailed north, sighting Cook Strait, which it mistook for a bight and named \"Zeehaen's Bight\". Two names that the expedition gave to landmarks in the far north of New Zealand still endure: Cape Maria van Diemen and Three Kings Islands. (Kaap Pieter Boreels was renamed Cape Egmont by Captain James Cook 125 years later.)\n\nReturn voyage\n\nTongatapu, the main island of Tonga; drawing by Isaack Gilsemans\n\nThe bay of Tongatapu with the two ships; drawing by Isaack Gilsemans\nEn route back to Batavia, Tasman came across the Tongan archipelago on 20 January 1643. While passing the Fiji Islands Tasman's ships came close to being wrecked on the dangerous reefs of the north-eastern part of the Fiji group. He charted the eastern tip of Vanua Levu and Cikobia-i-Lau before making his way back into the open sea.\n\nThe expedition turned north-west towards New Guinea and arrived back in Batavia on 15 June 1643.\n\nSecond major voyage\nTasman left Batavia on 30 January 1644 on his second voyage with three ships (Limmen, Zeemeeuw and the tender Braek). He followed the south coast of New Guinea eastwards in an attempt to find a passage to the eastern side of New Holland. However, he missed the Torres Strait between New Guinea and Australia, probably due to the numerous reefs and islands obscuring potential routes, and continued his voyage by following the shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria westwards along the north Australian coast. He mapped the north coast of Australia, making observations on New Holland and its people. He arrived back in Batavia in August 1644.\n\nFrom the point of view of the Dutch East India Company, Tasman's explorations were a disappointment: he had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route. Although Tasman was received courteously on his return, the company was upset that Tasman had not fully explored the lands he found, and decided that a more \"persistent explorer\" should be chosen for any future expeditions. For over a century, until the era of James Cook, Tasmania and New Zealand were not visited by Europeans; mainland Australia was visited, but usually only by accident.\n\nLater life\nOn 2 November 1644, Abel Tasman was appointed a member of the Council of Justice in Batavia. He went to Sumatra in 1646, and in August 1647 to Siam (now Thailand) with letters from the company to the King. In May 1648, he was in charge of an expedition sent to Manila to try to intercept and loot the Spanish silver ships coming from America, but he had no success and returned to Batavia in January 1649. In November 1649, he was charged and found guilty of having in the previous year hanged one of his men without trial, was suspended from his office of commander, fined, and made to pay compensation to the relatives of the sailor. On 5 January 1651, he was formally reinstated in his rank and spent his remaining years at Batavia. He was in good circumstances, being one of the larger landowners in the town. He died at Batavia on 10 October 1659 and was survived by his second wife and a daughter by his first wife. His property was divided between his wife and his daughter. In his will (dating from 1657), he left 25 guilders to the poor of his village, Lutjegast.\n\nAlthough Tasman's pilot, Frans Visscher, published Memoir concerning the discovery of the South land in 1642, Tasman's detailed journal was not published until 1898. Nevertheless, some of his charts and maps were in general circulation and used by subsequent explorers. The journal signed by Abel Tasman of the 1642 voyage is held in the Dutch National Archives at The Hague.\n\nLegacy\nTasman's ten-month voyage in 1642\u201343 had significant consequences. By circumnavigating Australia (albeit at a distance) Tasman proved that the small fifth continent was not joined to any larger sixth continent, such as the long-imagined Southern Continent. Further, Tasman's suggestion that New Zealand was the western side of that Southern Continent was seized upon by many European cartographers who, for the next century, depicted New Zealand as the west coast of a Terra Australis rising gradually from the waters around Tierra del Fuego. This theory was eventually disproved when Captain Cook circumnavigated New Zealand in 1769.\n\nMultiple places have been named after Tasman, including:\n\nthe Australian island and state of Tasmania, renamed after him, formerly Van Diemen's land. It includes features such as:\nthe Tasman Peninsula.\nthe Tasman Bridge.\nthe Tasman Highway.\nthe Tasman Sea.\n\nin New Zealand:\nthe Tasman Glacier.\nTasman Lake.\nthe Tasman River.\nMount Tasman.\nthe Abel Tasman National Park.\nTasman Bay / Te Tai-o-Aorere.\nthe Tasman District.\nAbel Tasman Monument.", "response": "Sure, here is summary about Abel Janszoon Tasman:\n\nAbel Janszoon Tasman (Dutch: [\u02c8\u0251b\u0259l \u02c8j\u0251nso\u02d0n \u02c8t\u0251sm\u0251n]; 1603 \u2013 10 October 1659) was a Dutch seafarer and explorer best known for his voyages of 1642 and 1644 in the service of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). He was appointed by the VOC to explore the uncharted regions of the Southern Pacific Ocean and discovered Van Diemen's Land, Staten Landt, and Nieuw Zeeland. Despite his achievements, his expedition was not entirely successful due to a violent confrontation with the M\u0101ori people on the South Island of New Zealand. Nonetheless, his expedition paved the way for further exploration and colonization of Australia and New Zealand by the Europeans. Abel Tasman was born around 1603 in Lutjegast, a small village in the province of Groningen, in the north of the Netherlands.\n\nHe served the Dutch East India Company until his death in 1659, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest explorers of his time. He was engaged to marry 21-year-old Jannetje Tjaers, of Palmstraat in the Jordaan district of the city, and took part in a voyage to Seram Island. He was second-in-command of a 1639 expedition of exploration into the north Pacific under Matthijs Quast, which reached Fort Zeelandia and Deshima.\n\nThe Council of the Indies dispatched Tasman and Franchoijs Jacobszoon Visscher on a voyage to explore the Provinces of Beach, which had appeared on European maps since the 15th century. Tasman attempted to land in North Bay, but the sea was too rough, so he turned away and continued his continent-hunting.\nTasman and his crew sighted land on the north-west coast of New Zealand, naming it Staten Landt in honour of the States General. Tasman's expedition encountered a group of M\u0101ori who attacked four sailors and named the area \"Murderers' Bay\".\n\nTasman's second voyage was a disappointment for the Dutch East India Company, who decided that a more persistent explorer should be chosen for future expeditions. Tasman's voyage in 1642-43 proved that the small fifth continent was not joined to any larger sixth continent, and his suggestion that New Zealand was the western side of that Southern Continent was seized upon by European cartographers.\n\nTasmanians have named places after him, including the Tasman Peninsula, Tasman Highway, Tasman Glacier, Tasman Lake, Mount Tasman, and Abel Tasman Monument.", "category": "summarization"}, {"instruction": "Who does what in U2?", "context": "U2 are an Irish rock band from Dublin, formed in 1976.

LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.\n\nProperties\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nHallucinations\nMain article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)\nIn artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a \"hallucination\" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nOn a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.\nUnpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called \"emergent abilities\". Researchers note that such abilities \"cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models\". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word\u2019s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\n\nArchitecture and training\nLarge language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or \"filling in the blanks\", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.\n\nThe earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words. The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.\n\nLLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.\n\nA 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training. These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).\n\nApplication to downstream tasks\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via \"prompting\" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.\n\nFine-tuning\nMain article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nFine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be \"frozen\", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).\n\nPrompting\nSee also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)\nIn the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In \"few-shot prompting\", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:\n\nReview: This movie stinks.\nSentiment: negative\n\nReview: This movie is fantastic!\nSentiment:\n\nIf the model outputs \"positive\", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be \"The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is\".\n\nFew-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.\n\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt \"Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet.\" might provide a completion such as \"A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17.\" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, \"self-instruct\", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "response": "Around 2018.", "category": "closed_qa"}, {"instruction": "Kamba Ramayanam was written by", "context": "", "response": "Kamba Ramayanam was written by Kamba Ramanarayanan, a Tamil poet of the late 19th century.

Tim was a quick learner and soon became very good at his job. As he gained more experience, Chad slowly stepped away, allowing Tim to take on more responsibility on his own.\nDespite this increased independence, Tim still reached out to Chad when he needed help or advice. Chad continued to guide him, but only as needed, letting Tim take the lead in his own professional development.\nAs Tim was promoted to a new role, he was assigned a new mentor - Rob - who followed the same approach as Chad. Tim threw himself into the new position, soaking up everything he could learn from Rob. Another five years passed by and he became very good at his job.\nHowever, after a decade of experience, Tim found himself at a crossroads, uncertain about what to do next. Over lunch one day, he confided in Jared, a manager from another team, about his indecisiveness. Jared listened attentively and asked Tim some probing questions to help him think through his options.\nTo each of Tim's responses, Jared asked more questions, guiding him towards a clearer understanding of his own goals and desires.

Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.\nAuroras are the result of disturbances in the\u00a0magnetosphere\u00a0caused by the\u00a0solar wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from\u00a0coronal holes\u00a0and\u00a0coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of\u00a0charged particles\u00a0in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly\u00a0electrons\u00a0and\u00a0protons,\u00a0precipitate\u00a0into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting\u00a0ionization\u00a0and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles.\nIn northern\u00a0latitudes, the effect is known as the aurora borealis or the northern lights.

A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 \u00d7 5 or 5 \u00d7 1, involve 5 itself. However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 \u00d7 2) in which both numbers are smaller than 4. Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order.\n\nThe property of being prime is called primality. A simple but slow method of checking the primality of a given number \n\ufffd\nn, called trial division, tests whether \n\ufffd\nn is a multiple of any integer between 2 and \n\ufffd\n{\\sqrt {n}}. Faster algorithms include the Miller\u2013Rabin primality test, which is fast but has a small chance of error, and the AKS primality test, which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical. Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as Mersenne numbers. As of December 2018 the largest known prime number is a Mersenne prime with 24,862,048 decimal digits.\n\nThere are infinitely many primes, as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC. No known simple formula separates prime numbers from composite numbers. However, the distribution of primes within the natural numbers in the large can be statistically modelled. The first result in that direction is the prime number theorem, proven at the end of the 19th century, which says that the probability of a randomly chosen large number being prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits, that is, to its logarithm.\n\nSeveral historical questions regarding prime numbers are still unsolved. These include Goldbach's conjecture, that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, and the twin prime conjecture, that there are infinitely many pairs of primes having just one even number between them. Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory, focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers. Primes are used in several routines in information technology, such as public-key cryptography, which relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors. In abstract algebra, objects that behave in a generalized way like prime numbers include prime elements and prime ideals.", "response": "A prime number is a natural number great than one that is only divisible by itself and one. e.g. 5 is a prime number as it is only divisible by 5 and 1, but 4 is not as 4 is divisible by 4,2 and 1", "category": "closed_qa"}, {"instruction": "Give me a list of places to go in San Diego, CA with kids", "context": "", "response": "1.

The importance of the metaphor lies in its analogy to the fragility of any system of thought. A set of conclusions is potentially undone once any of its fundamental postulates is disproved. In this case, the observation of a single black swan would be the undoing of the logic of any system of thought, as well as any reasoning that followed from that underlying logic.\n\nJuvenal's phrase was a common expression in 16th century London as a statement of impossibility. The London expression derives from the Old World presumption that all swans must be white because all historical records of swans reported that they had white feathers. In that context, a black swan was impossible or at least nonexistent.\n\nHowever, in 1697, Dutch explorers led by Willem de Vlamingh became the first Europeans to see black swans, in Western Australia.[citation needed] The term subsequently metamorphosed to connote the idea that a perceived impossibility might later be disproven. Taleb notes that in the 19th century, John Stuart Mill used the black swan logical fallacy as a new term to identify falsification.\n\nBlack swan events were discussed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2001 book Fooled By Randomness, which concerned financial events.

Oligopolies often result from the desire to maximize profits, which can lead to collusion between companies. This reduces competition, increases prices for consumers, and lowers wages for employees.\n\nMany industries have been cited as oligopolistic, including civil aviation, electricity providers, the telecommunications sector, Rail freight markets, food processing, funeral services, sugar refining, beer making, pulp and paper making, and automobile manufacturing.\n\nMost countries have laws outlawing anti-competitive behavior. EU competition law prohibits anti-competitive practices such as price-fixing and manipulating market supply and trade among competitors. In the US, the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission are tasked with stopping collusion. However, corporations can evade legal consequences through tacit collusion, as collusion can only be proven through actual and direct communication between companies.\n\nIt is possible for oligopolies to develop without collusion and in the presence of fierce competition among market participants. This is a situation similar to perfect competition, where oligopolists have their own market structure. In this situation, each company in the oligopoly has a large share in the industry and plays a pivotal, unique role. With post-socialist economies, oligopolies may be particularly pronounced.

Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing architects worldwide through his works and hundreds of apprentices in his Taliesin Fellowship. Wright believed in designing in harmony with humanity and the environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was exemplified in Fallingwater (1935), which has been called \"the best all-time work of American architecture\".\n\nWright was the pioneer of what came to be called the Prairie School movement of architecture and also developed the concept of the Usonian home in Broadacre City, his vision for urban planning in the United States. He also designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, and other commercial projects. Wright-designed interior elements (including leaded glass windows, floors, furniture and even tableware) were integrated into these structures. He wrote several books and numerous articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe. Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as \"the greatest American architect of all time\". In 2019, a selection of his work became a listed World Heritage Site as The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nRaised in rural Wisconsin, Wright studied civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin and then apprenticed in Chicago, briefly with Joseph Lyman Silsbee, and then with Louis Sullivan at Adler & Sullivan. Wright opened his own successful Chicago practice in 1893 and established a studio in his Oak Park, Illinois home in 1898. His fame increased and his personal life sometimes made headlines: leaving his first wife Catherine Tobin for Mamah Cheney in 1909; the murder of Mamah and her children and others at his Taliesin estate by a staff member in 1914; his tempestuous marriage with second wife Miriam Noel (m. 1923\u20131927); and his courtship and marriage with Olgivanna Lazovi\u0107 (m. 1928\u20131959).", "response": "Frank Lloyd Wright continues to be an inspiration in architecture around the United States and many of his originally designed buildings and structures stand today.", "category": "closed_qa"}, {"instruction": "What is sweep rowing?", "context": "Rowing, sometimes called crew in the United States, is the sport of racing boats using oars.

Bhrigu decided to test the gods. He first went to the King of Svarga, Indra, who ignored the sage, and was busy in enjoying the dance of apsaras in heaven. Bhrigu cursed Indra that he would only be referred to as an egoistic soul, all over the universe. He next visited Brahma. Brahma was busy with his four heads in chanting the Vedas, performing meditation, creating the world, and spending his time with his wife, Saraswati. Next, he visited Shiva. Shiva was busy in his Rudradhyanam with his wife, Parvati, at his feet. Bhrigu cursed Shiva that he would be worshipped only in the formless Lingam. At last, Bhrigu went to Vishnu. Vishnu was sleeping on Adishesha, and Lakshmi was at his feet. When Bhrigu arrived, he first saw Vishnu's feet, and felt humiliated. Enraged, he kicked Vishnu on his chest. Awakened, Vishnu started massaging Bhrigu's feet, and served him with great hospitality. Bhrigu was pleased, and ordered the sages to perform the rites to Vishnu. Lakshmi quarreled with Vishnu, as she felt that Bhrigu insulted her indirectly by hitting Vishnu on his chest where she lived, and thus left Vaikuntha.\n\nShe settled on earth in disguise as a young-sage like boy in the ancient city of Karvir, and meditated the name of Vishnu (Regarded by adherents to be the site of the Mahalakshmi temple). Vishnu soon arrived on earth, searching for his consort. He failed to find her, and instead settled on the Seshachalam hills. This happened to be the spot in Tirupati where Varaha had rested and taught Karma Yoga to the people till the beginning of Kali Yuga, after having rescuing Bhudevi from the wicked Hiranyaksha. Vishnu sat inside an anthill in his disguise, which was situated under a tamarind tree, and started chanting the name of his wife, Mahalakshmi.\n\nThe whole earth became gloomy. On the request of Parvati and Saraswati, Shiva and Brahma incarnated as a cow and a calf respectively, in the Chola kingdom. This cow and calf were being grazed daily by a shepherd of Chola kingdom in the Seshachalam hills. Everyday, the cow used to pour her milk into the anthill to lessen the thirst of Vishnu. Due to this, the cow and calf became pale and unhealthy. The shepherd noticed this, and felt that something was awry. The next day, the shepherd took the animals for grazing, and as was the custom, the cow poured milk into the anthill. The shepherd saw this act, and he threw an axe (parasu) on the cow and calf. Vishnu noticed, and in order to protect them, Vishnu arose from the anthill and the axe hit his own forehead (the blood poured as his namam on his head). An enraged Vishnu cursed the shepherd that he would die immediately, and the latter succumbed to the blow of his own axe. This news reached the Chola king. The ruler suspected the absence of the shepherd. He went near the grazing field, and was surprised to see the corpse of the shepherd. He went to the grazing field, where the cows were offering their milk to Vishnu. However, Vishnu was in disguise, and so the king could not identify him. The king strung his arrow, believing that the milk should serve the kingdom rather than the boy he saw. Vishnu, once again, emerged, and grew enormous, stopped the arrows from passing further and he cursed the king for not maintaining the dharma of his kingdom. The king repented and surrendered at the deity's feet. Unlike the shepherd, the king had realised his mistake, which pleased Vishnu, and hence presented him with the boon that he would marry the king's daughter in his next birth.\n\nIn his next birth, Vishnu incarnated as Srinivasa, to a woman named Vakuladevi. It is said that in the Dvapara Yuga, Krishna presented Yashoda with a boon that he would be born to the former in the Kali Yuga. Vakuladevi is regarded as the reincarnation of Yashoda. Meanwhile, the goddess Lakshmi was born at the palace of Akasha Raja, the next birth of the Chola king. Srinivasa was a forest-dweller. One day, he met a beautiful girl named Padmavati, the princess of the Chola dynasty. Padmavati fell in love with Srinivasa , and decided to marry him. According to the boon of Vishnu to the Chola king in their previous births, Srinivasa has to marry Padmavati, princess of Chola dynasty.

In 1687, the city was annexed by the Mughals. In 1724, Asaf Jah I, the Mughal viceroy, declared his sovereignty and founded the Asaf Jahi dynasty, also known as the Nizams. Hyderabad served as the imperial capital of the Asaf Jahi's from 1769 to 1948. As capital of the princely state of Hyderabad, the city housed the British Residency and cantonment until Indian independence in 1947. Hyderabad was annexed by the Indian Union in 1948 and continued as a capital of Hyderabad State from 1948 to 1956. After the introduction of the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, Hyderabad was made the capital of the newly formed Andhra Pradesh. In 2014, Andhra Pradesh was split to form the state of Telangana, and Hyderabad became the joint capital of the two states with a transitional arrangement scheduled to end in 2024.

The precise function of palmitoylation depends on the particular protein being considered. Palmitoylation enhances the hydrophobicity of proteins and contributes to their membrane association. Palmitoylation also appears to play a significant role in subcellular trafficking of proteins between membrane compartments, as well as in modulating protein\u2013protein interactions. In contrast to prenylation and myristoylation, palmitoylation is usually reversible (because the bond between palmitic acid and protein is often a thioester bond). The reverse reaction in mammalian cells is catalyzed by acyl-protein thioesterases (APTs) in the cytosol and palmitoyl protein thioesterases in lysosomes. Because palmitoylation is a dynamic, post-translational process, it is believed to be employed by the cell to alter the subcellular localization, protein\u2013protein interactions, or binding capacities of a protein.\n\nAn example of a protein that undergoes palmitoylation is hemagglutinin, a membrane glycoprotein used by influenza to attach to host cell receptors. The palmitoylation cycles of a wide array of enzymes have been characterized in the past few years, including H-Ras, Gs\u03b1, the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In signal transduction via G protein, palmitoylation of the \u03b1 subunit, prenylation of the \u03b3 subunit, and myristoylation is involved in tethering the G protein to the inner surface of the plasma membrane so that the G protein can interact with its receptor.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "What is it like living in Chicago, Illinois?", "context": "", "response": "Chicago is a large city located in the midwest.

He submitted two proposals, Senate Resolutions Nos. 25 and 39. The amendment proposal finally accepted was Senate Joint Resolution No. 40, introduced by Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island, the Senate majority leader and Finance Committee Chairman. The amendment was proposed as part of the congressional debate over the 1909 Payne\u2013Aldrich Tariff Act; by proposing the amendment, Aldrich hoped to temporarily defuse progressive calls for the imposition of new taxes in the tariff act. Aldrich and other conservative leaders in Congress largely opposed the actual ratification of the amendment, but they believed that it had little chance of being ratified, as ratification required approval by three quarters of the state legislatures.\n\nOn July 12, 1909, the resolution proposing the Sixteenth Amendment was passed by the Congress and was submitted to the state legislatures. Support for the income tax was strongest in the western and southern states, while opposition was strongest in the northeastern states. Supporters of the income tax believed that it would be a much better method of gathering revenue than tariffs, which were the primary source of revenue at the time. From well before 1894, Democrats, Progressives, Populists and other left-oriented parties argued that tariffs disproportionately affected the poor, interfered with prices, were unpredictable, and were an intrinsically limited source of revenue. The South and the West tended to support income taxes because their residents were generally less prosperous, more agricultural and more sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices. A sharp rise in the cost of living between 1897 and 1913 greatly increased support for the idea of income taxes, including in the urban Northeast. A growing number of Republicans also began supporting the idea, notably Theodore Roosevelt and the \"Insurgent\" Republicans (who would go on to form the Progressive Party). These Republicans were driven mainly by a fear of the increasingly large and sophisticated military forces of Japan, Britain and the European powers, their own imperial ambitions, and the perceived need to defend American merchant ships. Moreover, these progressive Republicans were convinced that central governments could play a positive role in national economies. A bigger government and a bigger military, they argued, required a correspondingly larger and steadier source of revenue to support it.\n\nOpposition to the Sixteenth Amendment was led by establishment Republicans because of their close ties to wealthy industrialists, although not even they were uniformly opposed to the general idea of a permanent income tax. In 1910, New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes, shortly before becoming a Supreme Court Justice, spoke out against the income tax amendment. Hughes supported the idea of a federal income tax, but believed the words \"from whatever source derived\" in the proposed amendment implied that the federal government would have the power to tax state and municipal bonds. He believed this would excessively centralize governmental power and \"would make it impossible for the state to keep any property\".\n\nBetween 1909 and 1913, several conditions favored passage of the Sixteenth Amendment. Inflation was high and many blamed federal tariffs for the rising prices. The Republican Party was divided and weakened by the loss of Roosevelt and the Insurgents who joined the Progressive Party, a problem that blunted opposition even in the Northeast. In 1912, the Democrats won the presidency and control of both houses of Congress. The country was generally in a left-leaning mood, with a member of the Socialist Party winning a seat in the U.S. House in 1910 and the party's presidential candidate polling six percent of the popular vote in 1912.\n\nThree advocates for a federal income tax ran in the presidential election of 1912. On February 25, 1913, Secretary of State Philander Knox proclaimed that the amendment had been ratified by three-fourths of the states and so had become part of the Constitution. The Revenue Act of 1913, which greatly lowered tariffs and implemented a federal income tax, was enacted shortly after the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified.", "response": "Reasons the Sixteenth Amendment to the US constitution was passed by Congress in 1909 and ratified by the states in 1913 include:\n1. Democrats and progressives believed the income tax to be fairer method of generating revenue than tariffs (taxes on the import and export of goods).\n2. Western and southern states were concerned about commodity prices, which were impacted by tariffs, and therefore preferred an alternative means of revenue.\n3.

First, recall that irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as p / q for integers p and q. Assume for contradiction that the square root of 2 is rational, which would mean that sqrt(2) = p / q for some integers p and q. Further assume without loss of generality that this fraction is in reduced form, meaning that p and q share no common factors. We can assume this because any integer fraction can be written in such a reduced form, so the existence of any rational representation for sqrt(2) would imply the existence of one in reduced form. Now we square both sides of the above equation, yielding\n\n2 = p^2 / q^2\n\nfor some integers p and q not sharing any common factors. Now multiply by q^2 to get\n\n2 * q^2 = p^2\n\nNote that the left hand side is even due to the factor of 2, so the right hand side p^2 is even as well. This means that p must be even as well, otherwise p^2 would not be even. So p can be written as 2 * x for some integer x. Substituting this into the above equation, we get\n\n2 * q^2 = (2 * x)^2 = 2^2 * x^2\n\nNote that both sides of the equation have a factor of 2 we can cancel. Doing this, we get\n\nq^2 = 2 * x^2\n\nBy an argument analogous to the one above, we can conclude that q is even. However this contradicts our assumption that p and q shared no common factors.

Work was completed in August 1940, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Bismarck and her sister ship Tirpitz were the largest battleships ever built by Germany, and two of the largest built by any European power.\n\nIn the course of the warship's eight-month career, Bismarck conducted only one offensive operation that lasted 8 days in May 1941, codenamed Rhein\u00fcbung. The ship, along with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen, was to break into the Atlantic Ocean and raid Allied shipping from North America to Great Britain. The two ships were detected several times off Scandinavia, and British naval units were deployed to block their route. At the Battle of the Denmark Strait, the battlecruiser HMS Hood initially engaged Prinz Eugen, probably by mistake, while HMS Prince of Wales engaged Bismarck. In the ensuing battle Hood was destroyed by the combined fire of Bismarck and Prinz Eugen, which then damaged Prince of Wales and forced her retreat. Bismarck suffered sufficient damage from three hits by Prince of Wales to force an end to the raiding mission.\n\nThe destruction of Hood spurred a relentless pursuit by the Royal Navy involving dozens of warships. Two days later, heading for occupied France to effect repairs, Bismarck was attacked by fifteen Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal; one scored a hit that rendered the battleship's steering gear inoperable. In her final battle the following morning, the already-crippled Bismarck was engaged by two British battleships and two heavy cruisers, and sustained incapacitating damage and heavy loss of life. The ship was scuttled to prevent her being boarded by the British, and to allow the ship to be abandoned so as to limit further casualties. Most experts agree that the battle damage would have caused her to sink eventually.\n\nThe wreck was located in June 1989 by Robert Ballard, and has since been further surveyed by several other expeditions.", "response": "The Bismarck was a battleship built for the German Navy in World War 2.

Any can't-miss attractions?", "context": "", "response": "Tokyo is a massive city and even if I were to give you hundreds of recommendations, they would not begin to scratch the surface. What follows is a rundown of good things to know, food to eat, and places you may want to visit.\n\nGeneral tips and tricks:\n- Bring cash: Do a currency exchange and pick up plenty of Yen at the airport \u2014 Tokyo is a very cash-heavy town and your local currency won\u2019t cut it. \n- Take the Narita Express: If you\u2019re flying into Narita, the airport is far from the city center and the easiest way to get there is via Narita Express (abbreviated to N\u2019EX), run by JR East. You have to book an actual seat on the Narita Express, and if you don't speak Japanese, don't try using one of the machines at the airport, go to an actual desk to speak to someone who can help you buy a round-trip ticket. \n- Use the Metro: Hands down, the best way to get around Tokyo. If you stay in Shinjuku, Harajuku, Shibuya or Shinagawa, you\u2019ll be on the Yamanote Line, which will get you almost everywhere you want to go (or to an easy transfer). You\u2019ll need to buy a reusable Suica card \u2014 again, highly highly recommend having Yen with you so you can easily load up your card. All of the Suica machines have translation options. \n- Make dinner reservations: It can be difficult to make reservations if you don't speak Japanse! If you\u2019re staying at a hotel, use your concierge. If not, try one of following sites: Tablecheck, Tabelog and Retty.\n- Make use of these helpful phrases:\nThank you (formal): Arigatou Gozaimasu (pronounced \u201cAh-di-got-oh Goze-eye-moss\u201d)\nI\u2019m sorry / excuse me: Sumimasen (pronounced \u201csue-me-mah-sahn\u201d)\nGood morning: Ohayo Gozaimasu (pronounced \u201coh-hi-yo Goze-eye-moss\u201d)\nGood evening: Konbanwa (pronounced: \u201ckon-bon-wah\u201d)\n\nWhat to eat:\n- Omakase: If you enjoy sushi (which you probably do if you're visiting Japan!), don't miss the chance to enjoy an Omakase meal. Sushi chefs take their art seriously and whether you choose to go to a classic high-end restaurant like Sukiyabashi Jiro Roppongi (from Jiro Dreams of Sushi) or Nishiazabu Sushi Shin, or something more inventive like Udatsu, or the even more casual Sushipanchi, you will be treated to a true experience. \n- Gyoza: Who doesn't love dumplings? You should be able to find casual gyoza options throughout the city. \nYakitori: Another casual dinning experience with tons of options. If you're interested in truly experiencing yakitori and aren't afraid of squeezing through alleyways for it, visit the Golden Gai or Piss Alley.\n- Ramen: I don\u2019t have specific recommendations for ramen because some of the best places are \"holes in the wall\" that you wander into. You can download the Ramen Beast app if you need direction. \n\nAttractions and experiences to consider:\n- Meiji Jingu: This is probably the most famous shrine in Tokyo (in Shibuya, near Harajuku) and definitely worth visiting. \n- Senso-ji: Famous Buddhist temple.\n- Imperial Palace: The residential place the Emperors and their families since 1868.\n- Sumo wrestling tournaments: Grand tournaments only happen a few times a year, but check the schedule and see if you can catch a day of matches! It\u2019s fascinating and even more enjoyable if you read up on the rituals in advance. \n- Public baths or sentos: Experience Japanese bathing culture, but be ready to de-robe and cover any tattoos!", "category": "creative_writing"}, {"instruction": "learn about 1989 UP\u2013DND accord", "context": "The 1989 University of the Philippines\u2013Department of National Defense accord (UP\u2013DND accord) was a bilateral agreement between the Department of National Defense (DND) and the University of the Philippines (UP) that restricted military and police access and operations inside the university.\n\nBackground\nOn October 28, 1981, an agreement between then-UP student leader Sonia Soto and then-defense minister Juan Ponce Enrile, known as the Soto\u2013Enrile accord, was signed to protect students from the presence of the military and police in any of UP's campuses.\n\nOn June 16, 1989, Donato Continente, a staffer of The Philippine Collegian and an alleged communist, was arrested within the premises of the university for his involvement in the killing of US Army Col. James Nicholas Rowe on April 21, 1989. The Supreme Court of the Philippines later shortened Continente's jail sentence, releasing him on June 28, 2005, after being incarcerated for over 14 years. Continente pled not guilty of the crime and claimed that he was tortured and abducted by ununiformed authorities to admit that he took part in it.\n\nNegotiation\n14 days after Continente's arrest, on June 30, 1989, UP President Jose V. Abueva and Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos signed the agreement, which effectively succeeded the 1981 Soto\u2013Enrile accord. The agreement was made to ensure the academic freedom of UP's students and prevent state officials from interfering with students' protests.\n\nProvisions\nThe provisions of the agreement were the following:\n\nState officials that are intending to conduct an operation inside a UP campus shall give a prior notification to the UP administration except in the events of a pursuit, or any other emergency situations.\nUP officials shall provide assistance to law enforcers within UP premises and endeavor to strengthen its own security, police, and fire-fighting capabilities without being exploited unlawfully.\nOnly uniformed authorities may enter the university if a request for assistance by the UP administration is granted.\nState officials shall not interfere with any peaceful protest being conducted by the UP's constituents within the premises of the university. UP officials shall be deemed responsible for the actions and behavior of their constituents.\nSearch and arrest warrants for students, faculty members, and employees shall be given after a prior notification was sent to the UP administration.\nNo warrant shall be served after twenty-four hours of its service and without the presence of at least two UP officials.\nThe arrest and detention of any UP student, faculty, and employee in the Philippines shall be reported immediately by the authorities in-charge to the UP administration.\nTermination\nOn January 18, 2021, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and his office announced to the public the unilateral termination of the agreement citing that the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, New People's Army (NPA), both tagged as terrorist organizations by the Anti-Terrorism Council, have been recruiting members inside the university and called it a \"hindrance in providing effective security, safety, and welfare of the students, faculty, and employees of UP.\" The DND notified the termination of the agreement to UP three days earlier. The Armed Forces of the Philippines chairman of the joint chiefs Gilbert Gapay claimed that at least 18 students of the university recruited by the NPA have been killed so far in clashes with the military according to their records.\n\nA similar agreement between the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) and the DND that was signed in 1990 is also being advocated for termination by Duterte Youth Representative Ducielle Cardema.\n\nReactions and responses\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte supported the DND's decision to abrogate the agreement according to a statement by Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque. In an interview with CNN Philippines, Roque, a former UP law professor and human rights lawyer, replied to a tweet from UP professor Danilo Arao that questions his honor and excellence, by saying that he already asked the defense secretary and the UP president to settle down. When asked about his personal opinion about the decision, he said, \"there's really no such thing when you are a presidential spokesperson.\"\n\nVice President Leni Robredo, on the other hand, denounced the decision and said that the decision was meant to silence the critics of the administration. On January 20, Senators Joel Villanueva, Sonny Angara, Nancy Binay, and Grace Poe filed a bill in the Senate to institutionalize the accord into Republic Act No. 9005, or the University of the Philippines Charter of 2008. Several lawmakers from both branches of Congress have also expressed their concerns and disagreements with the DND's decision.\n\nUP President Danilo Concepcion said that the termination of the agreement was \"totally unnecessary and unwarranted\" and was made without consulting the UP administration. UP Student Regent Renee Co, meanwhile, called the decision \"one of the [government's] worst attempts at destroying the institutional safeguards that UP students have fought to put in their struggle for their democratic rights.\"\n\nOn January 19, the UP held a rally to condemn the termination of the agreement. The hashtag #DefendUP was trended on Twitter with some discussion pointed to the Duterte administration, stating that \"this is another way of the administration to threaten and silence activists who have opposed President Duterte's several policies, especially on supposed red-tagging activities and on the COVID-19 pandemic response.\"", "response": "The 1989 University of the Philippines\u2013Department of National Defense accord (UP\u2013DND accord) was a bilateral agreement between the Department of National Defense (DND) and the University of the Philippines (UP) that restricted military and police access and operations inside the university.

Hence less thrust is required and therefore smaller engines, resulting in a greater weight saving than the original reduction. This iteration can be repeated several times, although the decrease in weight gives diminishing returns.\n\nThe startup process of a feedback electronic oscillator, when power to the circuit is switched on, is a technical application of the snowball effect. Electronic noise is amplified by the oscillator circuit and returned to its input filtered to contain primarily the selected (desired) frequency, gradually getting stronger in each cycle, until a steady-state oscillation is established, when the circuit parameters satisfy the Barkhausen stability criterion.", "response": "The snowball effect is used to describe the multiplication effect in an original weight saving in aerospace engineering.", "category": "closed_qa"}, {"instruction": "Give me a bulleted list of the seven most recently elected presidents from Argentina.", "context": "", "response": "Sure!

Will these robots solve all of our problems, or will they spell the end of the human race?", "context": "", "response": "Imagine a world where hundreds of robots are working with humans. Some of them deliver food, and some might be working at a cafe or a restaurant. They are all around us, helping people to do many things. Sometimes, they can do what humans can\u2019t do, and they can also sometimes perform better than humans. Nowadays, many scientists and engineers are arguing if artificial intelligence could dramatically make our lives better, or would it spell the end of the human race?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robots and Artificial Intelligence(A.I. for short) are developing systematically but dramatically, so someday, they might feel and think like humans. For example, some robots can \u201cfeel\u201d pain by detecting how strong the force is to technically \u201cfeel\u201d the pain. Furthermore, robots can think like humans by programming them to think how humans do. However, robots have less flexible thinking, since they are only doing what others programmed them to do, especially robots like Industrial robots that are less complex.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, because A.I. is developing at a great speed, it might eventually become a threat to the human race. Many people such as Steven Hawkings warned that as A.I. develops further, they might be unstoppable, and might become one of the most dangerous enemies. Furthermore, according to the UN, A.I. might have stereotypical thoughts about certain races because of people\u2019s discriminative behavior, and it can further have an impact on judgment between many kinds of people. Primarily, robots and A.I. can be a threat to the human race, so we need to take care of its program and rule it better so that it can be a good tool that can improve our lives.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, I think that although now, A.I. still has some difficulties in doing certain things, A.I. can solve some of our problems, and make our lives better, and easier. A.I. can solve many problems, and they can even do some work better than humans. For example, robots can go to dangerous places like space, deep sea, and poisonous areas. Furthermore, robots can do dangerous jobs like welding which is dangerous work that needs to be done precisely. Robots are used in places like this because Industrial robots can do work precisely, and they can even save the worker\u2019s life. For another example, a remote robot called Canadarm2 that works in the International Space Station can help astronauts by doing work in space to help the other astronauts that make their life easier.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In conclusion, A.I. is starting to become part of our lives since it\u2019s starting to think and feel like humans with a great speed, and although it might become a threat to human races, I still think A.I. can solve many problems by doing what we have trouble doing. Once, Nick Boston claimed that \u201cMachine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to invent\u201d which means that humans only need to make A.I. because it can do things that other materials can, and it can also create and build itself. Since robots and A.I. can do many things that can help people, A.I. starting to become our reliable assistants as long as we take care of them.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "I want to take a skiing vacation.

The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a conduit for maritime trade. One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduces the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan.\n\nColombia, France, and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction. France began work on the canal in 1881, but stopped because of lack of investors' confidence due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate. The United States took over the project on May 4, 1904, and opened the canal on August 15, 1914. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding Panama Canal Zone until the 1977 Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties provided for its handover to Panama. After a period of joint American\u2013Panamanian control, the canal was taken over by the Panamanian government in 1999. It is now managed and operated by the government-owned Panama Canal Authority.\n\nCanal locks at each end lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake 26 meters (85 ft) above sea level, created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, and then lower the ships at the other end. The original locks are 33.5 meters (110 ft) wide. A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded waterway began commercial operation on June 26, 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, New Panamax ships.\n\nAnnual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships in 1914, when the canal opened, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, for a total of 333.7 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons. By 2012, more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal. In 2017 it took ships an average of 11.38 hours to pass between the canal's two locks.
