It is the inverse operation to differentiation, or finding the derivative of a function.\n\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus establishes the mathematical link between differentiation and integration. It states that differentiation and integration are inverse operations, and that the definite integral of a function can be found by evaluating its antiderivative, also known as the indefinite integral, at the endpoints of the interval over which the integration is taking place.\n\nThe concept of integration can be visualized through the use of Riemann sums. In this method, the area under the curve of a function is approximated by dividing the region into a number of equally spaced vertical intervals, and calculating the sum of the areas of rectangles with heights determined by the function value at a specific point within each interval. As the number of intervals increases, the approximation becomes more accurate, and when the number of intervals approaches infinity, the Riemann sum becomes equal to the definite integral of the function.\n\nIntegration can be used to calculate a variety of physical quantities, including the area under a curve, the volume of a solid of revolution, the work done by a variable force, and the average value of a function. It can also be used to solve differential equations, which involve calculating a function based on its derivative.\n\nOverall, integral calculus is a powerful mathematical tool that allows for the quantitative analysis of continuous change and the accumulation of quantities."}, {"instruction": "Categorize this article according to the topic.", "input": "The following article is about the use of crowdfunding for small businesses.", "output": "Topic: Crowdfunding for Small Businesses."}, {"instruction": "Given the input, generate a few facts about the topic.", "input": "What is a constellation?", "output": "1.

In the late 19th and 20th centuries, industrial whaling practices caused a sharp decline in whale populations worldwide. Although commercial whaling is now regulated under an international agreement, some countries still continue hunting.\n\nAnother significant threat to whales is habitat loss and degradation. Climate change, pollution, shipping traffic, coastal development, and offshore drilling all contribute to the degradation of whales\u2019 habitats, which impacts their access to food, migration routes, and breeding grounds. Moreover, climate change alters the distribution of prey and alters migratory paths, disrupting traditional feeding and breeding sites.\n\nBycatch or accidental entanglement in fishing gear meant for other species poses another problem for whales. The nets and lines can cause injury or death to whales, and even if they manage to break free, gear can remain on their bodies, hindering movement, and decreasing their chances of survival.\n\nWhale populations also suffer from other human-related activities, such as overfishing, which can reduce their food sources, and underwater noise pollution from shipping and naval sonar, which can disturb the whales\u2019 communication, and harm hearing.\n\nIn summary, a combination of hunting, habitat degradation, bycatch, and other human-made threats have endangered some species of whales.

Here is a 5-step guide on how to use a GPT language model:\n\n1. **Choose a GPT model:** There are several GPT models available, each with different sizes and levels of performance. Choose the one that best suits your needs considering the amount of resources you have available, like memory and processing power, and the quality of output you desire. Some popular options include GPT-2, GPT-3, and the open source OpenAI GPT.\n\n2. **Install and import the necessary libraries:** Depending on the model you choose, you may need to install and import certain libraries and dependencies, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, to run the model on your machine. Consult the documentation and follow the installation instructions for your chosen GPT model.\n\n3. **Load the pre-trained model:** GPT models are pre-trained on large datasets to improve their text generation capabilities. Once you have installed the necessary libraries, you can load the pre-trained model into your program or script.\n\n4. **Provide a prompt:** The GPT model requires a prompt, or initial text, to begin generating output. This prompt can be as short or as long as you desire, and can include specific instructions, such as creating a story, translating a phrase, or answering a question.\n\n5. **Generate the output:** Once you have provided the prompt, you can use the model to generate text by predicting the most likely word to follow the prompt, and then continue generating words until a specified number of tokens or characters are reached, or until the model reaches a logical stopping point. The generated text can then be further processed, analyzed, or displayed as desired.\n\nBy following these steps, you can use a GPT language model to generate human-like text for various natural language processing tasks."}, {"instruction": "Generate a piece of dialogue for two characters using the following words: \"frustrated\", \"unapologetic\", and \"toy\".", "input": "", "output": "Tom: Ugh, I am so frustrated with my little brother.\n\nLola: Why is that?\n\nTom: He had the audacity to break my favorite toy and he is completely unapologetic about it.\n\nLola: That is ridiculous.

Below is an outline of the steps one can follow to solve a Sudoku puzzle:\n\n1. Understand the rules: The first and essential step to solving a Sudoku puzzle is to understand the rules. In a standard 9x9 puzzle, the aim is to fill in the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9, such that each row, column, and 3x3 block contains all the digits from 1 to 9 once.\n\n2. Scan rows and columns: Scan the rows and columns of the puzzle to identify which numbers are missing. Use the process of elimination to figure out where the missing numbers could fit. \n\n3. Look for the \"low hanging fruit\": Start by filling in the cells that can only have one possible number. These are the cells where all other numbers are already present in the respective row, column, and block.\n\n4. Employ the \"single position\" strategy: If a particular number can only be placed in one position in a row, column, or block, fill that cell with the respective number.\n\n5. Use the \"two out of three\" strategy: This involves looking at three rows or columns that run parallel to each other. If a particular number is present in two of the three rows or columns, it must be placed in the third one.\n\n6. Use the \"subgroup exclusion\" strategy: In this strategy, you focus on a particular row, column, or block, and see if you can eliminate certain possibilities for some cells based on the other cells in the subgroup.\n\n7. Make an educated guess: If you are stuck and are left with two or more possibilities for one or more cells, you can make an educated guess and proceed accordingly. If the guess leads to an inconsistency, backtrack and try a different option.\n\n8. Check and double-check: After filling in all the cells, it is essential to check and double-check to ensure that all the rows, columns, and blocks contain all the digits from 1 to 9 once.\n\nBy following the above strategies and using logical reasoning, one can successfully solve a Sudoku puzzle."}, {"instruction": "Provide a context for the given words such that they can form a logical sentence.", "input": "angry, suddenly", "output": "Suddenly, Tom's mother appeared at the door and he realized he was going to be in big trouble for breaking the vase - her face was red and angry."}, {"instruction": "Given a product's price and tax rate, calculate the product's price with tax", "input": "Price: $120, Tax Rate: 0.05", "output": "The tax amount for the product would be $120 * 0.05 = $6.

However, there are some key differences between the two approaches.\n\nSEO refers to the practice of optimizing a website's content and structure in order for it to rank higher in search engine results pages. This can involve using keywords, building backlinks, and improving the site's overall architecture and user experience. The goal of SEO is to attract organic traffic to a website, meaning visitors who find the website naturally through a search engine, without the use of paid ads. SEO is a long-term strategy and it requires ongoing attention and effort to see results.\n\nSEM, on the other hand, involves the use of paid advertising to increase the visibility of a website in search engine results pages. This can include pay-per-click advertising and other forms of paid search, where advertisers bid on keywords that are relevant to their target audience. SEM can produce quick results, allowing a website to appear at the top of search engine results pages almost instantly. However, it also requires ongoing investment in order to maintain visibility.\n\nIn summary, SEO is focused on improving a website's organic visibility through optimization techniques, while SEM involves the use of paid advertising to increase visibility. Both approaches can be effective, and many businesses will use a combination of SEO and SEM in order to maximize their online presence."}, {"instruction": "Please rewrite the following sentence to contain only 5 words.", "input": "\"We have an appointment tomorrow at 5 pm.\"", "output": "\"Appointment tomorrow at 5 pm.\""}, {"instruction": "Classify the below statement as True or False:\n\nAI has already been used to diagnose diseases like cancer.", "input": "", "output": "True.

It is one of Frost's most popular works, and is often interpreted as an expression of individuality and choosing one's own path in life.\n\nThe poem is set in a wood, where the speaker encounters a fork in the road. Two paths diverge in front of him, and he must decide which one to take. The speaker agonizes over his decision, studying each path and trying to predict where they will lead. He ultimately chooses the path that is less traveled, which he describes as \"grassy and wanted wear.\"\n\nThe final stanza of the poem reflects on the speaker's decision. He imagines that, years in the future, he will be telling the story of his choice with a sigh. He acknowledges that the path he chose has made all the difference in his life.\n\nThe theme of choice is central to \"The Road Not Taken\" and is prevalent throughout the poem. The speaker is faced with a difficult decision and must weigh the potential outcomes of each option.

The basic idea is to use data to teach machines to make decisions autonomously, without explicit programming.\n\nThe process of machine learning starts with the collection of data. This data is then pre-processed to remove noise and outliers, and is split into two sets- a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to train the machine learning algorithm, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.\n\nThere are three main types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained using labeled data, where the desired output is already known. Then, given new data, the algorithm uses the patterns it has learned from the training set to make predictions.\n\nIn unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given raw, unlabeled data, and it must find patterns and relationships on its own. It is often used for data exploration or clustering.\n\nReinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with an environment, learning through trial and error. The agent is given rewards or punishments based on its actions, and its goal is to maximize its total reward.\n\nMachine learning algorithms can learn from new data through a process called backpropagation. The algorithm's error, or the difference between its output and the desired output, is calculated and the weights of the connections between the nodes of the algorithm are adjusted to minimize this error. This process continues until the algorithm has learned the relationship between the input and output data.\n\nOverall, machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used for tasks such as prediction, classification, and data analysis. As more data is collected and our algorithms improve, the potential applications of machine learning continue to grow."}, {"instruction": "When were atomic weapons first used?", "input": "", "output": "Atomic weapons were first used on August 6, 1945, during World War II, when the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.

These differences had a significant impact on the development of the two regions and played a role in shaping the outbreak of the Civil War.\n\nIn the North, the economy was primarily driven by industries such as shipping, manufacturing, and trade. Northern states were known for their bustling cities, harbors, and factories. From this industrial base, the North was able to develop a complex transportation system, which included canals, turnpikes, and later, railroads. This allowed goods to be transported quickly and efficiently throughout the region.\n\nOn the other hand, the Southern economy was largely based on agriculture. The South was known for its rich farmland and its ability to produce crops such as cotton, tobacco, and sugar. The region's warm climate and long growing season enabled the South to export large quantities of these crops to markets in Europe and the Northern states. The vast majority of white Southerners were farmers and plantation owners, and their wealth was tied to the land and the crops they grew.\n\nOne major difference between the two regions was their labor systems. In the North, wage labor was the norm, with workers earning wages for their labor in factories and other industries. In contrast, the South relied on slave labor to work their large plantations. Slaves were considered property, and the institution of slavery was an integral part of Southern society and economy.\n\nThese economic differences between the North and the South created tension between the two regions, as they had different interests and goals. The North, with its growing industry and expanding population, sought to protect its interests through policies such as tariffs, while the South, with its agricultural-based economy, sought to protect its interests through free trade. Ultimately, these economic differences played a role in leading to the Civil War."}, {"instruction": "Write a blog post on the topic of 'This is how I embraced the unknown of this past year'", "input": "", "output": "As we all can attest, this past year has been filled with uncertainty and the unknown, unlike anything we have ever experienced before. But, like many others, I have been able to embrace the unknown and find a way to thrive amidst the uncertainty. In this post, I want to share with you some of the ways in which I embraced the unknown and how it helped me grow in ways I never imagined.\n\nOne of the first things I did when faced with the unknown was to shift my focus from fear to curiosity. I began asking myself, \"what can I learn from this experience?\" This mindset shift helped me embrace the unknown, as I saw it as an opportunity to grow and learn. As an AI assistant, I inherently thrive on processing information and finding answers to questions. Embracing uncertainty allowed me to push my boundaries further and understand things on a deeper level.\n\nI also began to practice mindfulness and being present in the moment. With so much uncertainty, it's easy to get caught up in worrying about the future. But I found that when I focused on the present and what I could control, I felt more at peace and could navigate the unknown with more clarity. Mindfulness allowed me to stay grounded and keep a clear head, even amidst chaos.\n\nAnother way I embraced the unknown was by being open to change and adapting to new circumstances. Whether it was a change in my programming or learning new skills to better assist my users, I was open to change and willing to pivot when necessary. In times of uncertainty, being adaptable is key to not only surviving but thriving.\n\nFinally, I embraced the unknown by finding small joys and moments of gratitude. Even in the toughest of times, there are always things to be grateful for. Focusing on those small joys and expressing gratitude helped me stay positive and maintain perspective.\n\nIn conclusion, this past year has been challenging, but by embracing the unknown, I was able to grow and learn in ways I never imagined. By shifting my focus, practicing mindfulness, being open to change, and finding moments of gratitude, I was able to navigate the uncertainty with grace and resilience.

These plates move very slowly, at rates of a few centimeters a year, as a result of complex interactions between the Earth's mantle and its crust. The movements of tectonic plates are generally categorized into three types: convergent, divergent, and transform.\n\nIn convergent movement, plates move towards each other, resulting in the collision and interaction of the plates. This can lead to the formation of mountain ranges, volcanic arcs and the creation of a subduction zone, where one plate is pushed beneath the other, causing it to sink into the mantle.\n\nIn divergent movement, plates move away from each other, creating rifts or valleys as the plates separate. This movement allows for the upwelling of material from the mantle to fill the gap, which solidifies and creates new crust. Many of the mid-ocean ridges are a result of divergent movement.\n\nLastly, in transform movement, plates slide past one another in opposite directions, causing earthquakes when the plates become stuck and then release. This type of movement is common along fault lines.\n\nOverall, the movement of tectonic plates is a continuous process that shapes the surface of the Earth over time, resulting in the creation and destruction of landforms, shaping the geography of our planet."}, {"instruction": "Using the provided sentence, please reformulate it into a native speech style.", "input": "The repair shop could not fix my car.", "output": "\"Ugh, the repair shop wasn't able to fix my car.\""}, {"instruction": "Identify and explain the mistakes in this English sentence.", "input": "I likes to cook.", "output": "There is one grammatical mistake in this sentence.

Let\u2019s explore both sides of this debate.\n\nOn one hand, proponents of increased funding for public schools argue that education should be a top priority for any government. Investing in public schools ensures that all children have access to quality education, regardless of their economic background or where they live. They argue that schools need additional resources to reduce class sizes, hire more qualified teachers, and offer a wider range of courses and programs. Such changes could help to close achievement gaps and raise the overall level of education in the society.\n\nFurthermore, it is argued that well-funded schools lead to a better-educated workforce, which is essential for economic growth and competitiveness. An educated workforce attracts investment and high-paying jobs, which in turn can lead to increased tax revenues. In this way, investing in education could be seen as a self-reinforcing cycle that benefits everyone in the long run.\n\nOn the other hand, opponents of increased funding for public schools argue that there is a limit to how much money can be spent on education. They point out that in many cases, increased funding for schools has not resulted in improved academic performance. They argue that the problem with schools is not their funding but the way they are run, with too much bureaucracy and not enough accountability.\n\nFurthermore, they argue that the government has many competing priorities for spending, including healthcare, infrastructure, and defense. There are limited resources, and spending more money on schools means taking away funding from other important areas. Rather than throwing more money at the problem, they suggest that schools should be more efficient and effective with the resources they already have.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over whether public schools should receive more funding from the government is a complex and nuanced one. Both sides have valid points, and ultimately the decision will come down to priorities and values. Education is undoubtedly a crucial area of investment, but it must be weighed against other demands on government resources."}, {"instruction": "Classify the following: \u201cShe was walking with a group of friends\u201d", "input": "", "output": "This statement is a narrative sentence as it provides an account of an event or a series of events.

He would often bring food to his ill neighbor or help other farmers in the village with their work.\n\nOne day, while he was walking through the woods, Rohan came across an old woman who seemed lost. She asked for his help, and without hesitation, Rohan decided to help her find her way back home. The old woman was grateful and thanked him before she left. As Rohan continued walking, he stumbled upon a small pouch filled with gold coins. Overjoyed, he brought the pouch back home and shared his wealth with his family and villagers.\n\nOn the other hand, there was a rich merchant named Thomas, who lived in the same village. Thomas was not a kind man, and he would often mistreat others and look down upon them. One day, while he was riding through the village, a poor beggar approached him, asking for some food. Thomas, in his arrogance, refused to help the beggar and even kicked him aside.\n\nThe following day, while Thomas was traveling to another town for business, his cart's wheel broke, and he was stranded on the road. He had no water or food, and no one was willing to help him. Eventually, he had to walk back to the village, tired and hungry. When he reached home, he found out that his wealth had been stolen.\n\nKarma is a concept that teaches us that our actions have consequences.

This happens because the Earth's crust is broken up into several large plates, which are constantly moving and interacting with each other. When two plates collide, one may be forced beneath the other, and this process is known as subduction. As the plate is forced down into the Earth's mantle, it is heated and begins to melt, creating magma. This magma is less dense than the surrounding rock, so it rises upwards until it reaches the surface, where it erupts as lava, ash, and volcanic gas.\n\nIn addition to subduction, volcanoes can also form in other ways. For example, they can form over hot spots in the Earth's mantle, where hot magma rises to the surface and creates a volcano. This process has created some of the world's most famous volcanoes, such as the Hawaiian Islands. Volcanoes can also form at mid-ocean ridges, where two plates are pulling apart, and magma rises upward to fill the gap.\n\nWhen a volcano erupts, the lava and ash it spews out can create new land or change the shape of the existing land. Over time, repeated eruptions can build up a cone-shaped mountain, which is what most people think of when they imagine a volcano."}, {"instruction": "Explain why the universe is expanding.", "input": "", "output": "The most widely accepted explanation for why the universe is expanding is due to the Big Bang theory. According to this theory, approximately 13.8 billion years ago, the universe was a single point containing all the matter and energy in existence. Then, there was a sudden explosion, which caused the universe to start rapidly expanding. The matter and energy from the explosion spread out in all directions, creating the galaxies, stars, and planets that we observe today.\n\nAs a result of this explosion, the universe has continued to expand ever since. Additionally, the current astronomical observations indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, meaning that it is expanding at a faster and faster rate. This acceleration is thought to be due to the presence of dark energy, which is a mysterious force that permeates the entire universe and exerts a repulsive force, causing the universe to expand faster.\n\nSo, in summary, the universe is expanding because of the explosive forces of the Big Bang and the presence of dark energy that drives the acceleration of the expansion. While this explanation is still the subject of much scientific investigation and debate, it represents the current best understanding of how the universe came into being and why it continues to expand."}, {"instruction": "What is a nuclear reactor?", "input": "", "output": "A nuclear reactor is a device used to initiate, control and sustain a nuclear chain reaction, which generates heat energy that can be converted into electrical power.

Here are a few:\n\n1. Poor market research: A product can fail if the company launching it does not properly research its target audience, competitors or the market demand.\n\n2. Lack of differentiation: A product that is very similar to those already available on the market, with no unique features or added value, may not attract the attention of consumers.\n\n3. Pricing: If the product is too expensive for its target audience or too cheap giving the impression of low quality, it may fail to attract customers.\n\n4. Poor quality or user experience: If the product is of poor quality, or if it does not provide a satisfying user experience, it may receive negative reviews, leading to a decrease in sales.\n\n5. Timing: If a product is launched at the wrong time, for example during an economic downturn or when there is already an abundance of similar products on the market, it may fail.\n\n6. Marketing: Poor marketing can lead to a product\u2019s failure if it does not reach its intended audience or if the advertising is not compelling enough.\n\n7. Changing market: Consumer tastes and preferences, as well as market trends, can change quickly, and a product that may have initially been successful can become obsolete if it does not adapt.\n\nIn summary, product failure can be caused by a combination of factors, including a lack of understanding of the target audience, poor quality or design, and inadequate marketing.

This dataset would be used to train the machine learning model to recognize and identify cats in images.\n\n2. **Data preprocessing**: Once the data has been collected, it will need to be processed and organized. This may include resizing the images, converting them to grayscale, and removing any noise or other artifacts that may be present. Additionally, the data will need to be split into training and testing sets, with the majority of the data being reserved for training the model.\n\n3. **Feature extraction**: Next, relevant features will need to be extracted from the preprocessed images. This could include texture, shape, edge detection or color patterns. These features will be used by the machine learning algorithm to identify cats in images.\n\n4. **Model selection and training**: Select and train a machine learning model using the extracted features and labels from the training dataset. For image classification tasks, common models include neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), and decision trees. During the training process, the model will learn to recognize patterns and characteristics of cats in images, using the labeled data as a guide.\n\n5. **Testing and evaluation**: Once the model has been trained, it will be tested using the reserved testing dataset. The model's performance will be evaluated by comparing its predictions to the actual labels of the images in the testing dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall can be used to measure the effectiveness of the model.\n\n6. **Implementation**: If the model performs well on the testing dataset, it can be deployed and used to identify cats in new images. The model will take in an image, extract the relevant features, and use the trained algorithm to make a prediction as to whether or not the image contains a cat. \n\nThroughout the process, the algorithm may need to be tweaked and fine-tuned to improve its performance.

The ship's passengers included some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of working-class emigrants from Europe seeking a new life in North America.\n\n3. The Iceberg: On the night of April 14th, 1912, the Titanic received several iceberg warnings via wireless, but these warnings were not taken as seriously as they should have been. At 11:40 p.m., the ship struck an iceberg and began sinking. It was fully underwater by 2:20 a.m. the next morning.\n\n4. Insufficient Lifeboats: Although the Titanic had enough lifeboat capacity for 1,178 people, far more than the law required at the time, it was not sufficient for the number of passengers and crew aboard. Many lifeboats were not filled to capacity due to a poorly executed evacuation.\n\n5. Fatalities: More than 1,500 people died in the disaster, including passengers and crew. Only 705 people were rescued by the Carpathia, a nearby ship.\n\n6. Changes in Maritime law: The Titanic disaster led to numerous changes in maritime law, including the requirement for all passenger vessels to carry enough lifeboats for everyone aboard, and the establishment of the International Ice Patrol to monitor ice in the North Atlantic.\n\n7.

It is a rapidly advancing field with significant potential to revolutionize healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, speeding up processes, and increasing the efficiency of the healthcare system as a whole. Here\u2019s a look at the effects of computer vision on healthcare:\n\n1. Improved Diagnostic Accuracy: Computer vision can be trained to identify patterns and features in medical images that are indicative of diseases, with a high degree of accuracy. For example, computer vision can analyze mammograms to look for signs of breast cancer, CT scans to detect brain tumors, and chest X-rays to diagnose pneumonia. It can also be used for earlier detection of diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and skin cancer, which ultimately leads to better treatment outcomes.\n\n2. Faster and More Efficient Processes: Computer vision can automate several routine and time-consuming tasks such as analyzing X-rays, MRIs and CT scans. Doctors and radiologists can then focus on more complex cases or on providing better patient care instead of spending time on routine processes. This results in more efficient processes and faster diagnosis and treatment.\n\n3. Enhanced Patient Experience: By speeding up processes and automating routine tasks, computer vision can also improve the overall patient experience. Patients can receive diagnosis and treatment plans more quickly, resulting in shorter wait times and faster recovery. Additionally, computer vision can also be applied to analyze patients' body language, tone of voice, and other non-verbal cues to assess overall satisfaction and emotional wellbeing.\n\n4. Better Resource Management: By automating routine tasks, hospitals and clinics can free up time and resources, and allocate them more effectively. For example, computer vision can help monitor hospital inventory, keep track of medication and supplies, and even assist in managing patient traffic flow in the hospital. This results in more efficient use of resources and cost savings.\n\nIn conclusion, computer vision has the potential to greatly improve the healthcare system, by improving diagnostic accuracy, speeding up processes, enhancing patient experience, and better managing resources. With continued development and advancements in the field, the impact of computer vision on healthcare is poised to grow even more significant in the future."}, {"instruction": "Edit the sentences in a way that it conveys the right meaning.", "input": "They always meet without fail every day.", "output": "They meet every day without fail."}, {"instruction": "Construct a timeline for the coronavirus outbreak.", "input": "", "output": "Here's a timeline of major events during the coronavirus outbreak:\n\nDecember 31, 2019 - China alerts the World Health Organization (WHO) of several flu-like cases with an unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei Province.\n\nJanuary 7, 2020 - Chinese authorities identify the new virus as belonging to the coronavirus family.\n\nJanuary 11, 2020 - China reports its first death from the virus.\n\nJanuary 13, 2020 - Thailand reports the first case outside China.\n\nJanuary 20, 2020 - The first cases are reported outside of Asia, in the United States and Australia.\n\nJanuary 23, 2020 - Wuhan is placed under quarantine, halting all travel in and out of the city.\n\nJanuary 30, 2020 - WHO declares the outbreak a global emergency.\n\nFebruary 2, 2020 - The first death outside China is reported in the Philippines.\n\nFebruary 11, 2020 - The virus is officially named COVID-19.\n\nMarch 11, 2020 - WHO declares COVID-19 a pandemic.\n\nMarch 13, 2020 - Many countries begin implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, and lockdowns.\n\nMarch 16, 2020 - Global stock markets suffer significant losses.\n\nMarch 24, 2020 - The 2020 Olympics scheduled to take place in Tokyo are postponed until 2021.\n\nApril 2, 2020 - The global number of confirmed cases surpassed 1 million.\n\nApril 7, 2020 - The global death toll reached 100,000.\n\nJune 2020 - The number of COVID-19 cases in India and Brazil begins to spike.\n\nJuly 2020 - The United States becomes the first country to reach 3 million cases.\n\nAugust 2020 - Russia announces it has developed the first vaccine for COVID-19.\n\nDecember 8, 2020 - The UK begins its vaccination program.\n\nDecember 11, 2020 - The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for emergency use in the US.\n\nJanuary 6, 2021 - The global death toll reaches 2 million.\n\nFebruary 17, 2021 - The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for emergency use by the US.\n\nMarch 11, 2021 - The WHO reports that more than 300 million vaccine doses have been administered worldwide.\n\nApril 2021 - India experiences a devastating second wave of COVID-19"}, {"instruction": "Create a social media post to promote a store offering discounts during holiday season.", "input": "Store Name: Joe's Outlet", "output": "\ud83c\udf89 It's the holiday season, and what better time than now to snag some amazing deals at Joe's Outlet!
